    "text": "Science advanced dramatically during the 20th century. There were new and radical developments in the physical, life and human sciences, building on the progress made in the 19th century.\n\nThe development of post-Newtonian theories in physics, such as special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics led to the development of nuclear weapons.  New models of the structure of the atom led to developments in theories of chemistry and the development of new materials such as nylon and plastics.  Advances in biology led to large increases in food production, as well as the elimination of diseases such as polio.\n\nA massive amount of new technologies were developed in the 20th century.  Technologies such as electricity, the incandescent light bulb, the automobile and the phonograph, first developed at the end of the 19th century, were perfected and universally deployed.  The first airplane flight occurred in 1903, and by the end of the century large airplanes such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 flew thousands of miles in a matter of hours.  The development of the television and computers caused massive changes in the dissemination of information.\n\n Astronomy and space exploration \n\nthumb|American Buzz Aldrin during the first moonwalk in 1969. The relatively young aerospace engineering industries rapidly grew in the 66 years after the Wright brothers first flight.\n\n A much better understanding of the evolution of the universe was achieved, its age (about 13.8 billion years) was determined, and the Big Bang theory on its origin was proposed and generally accepted.\n The age of the solar system, including Earth, was determined, and it turned out to be much older than believed earlier: more than 4 billion years, rather than the 20 million years suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1862.\n The planets of the solar system and their moons were closely observed via numerous space probes. Pluto was discovered in 1930 on the edge of the solar system, although in the early 21st century, it was reclassified as a plutoid instead of a planet proper, leaving eight planets.\n No trace of life was discovered on any of the other planets in our solar system (or elsewhere in the universe), although it remained undetermined whether some forms of primitive life might exist, or might have existed, somewhere. Extrasolar planets were observed for the first time.\n In 1969, Apollo 11 was launched towards the Moon and Neil Armstrong became the first person from Earth to walk on another celestial body.\n The Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union gave a peaceful outlet to the political and military tensions of the Cold War, leading to the first human spaceflight with the Soviet Union's Vostok 1 mission in 1961, and man's first landing on another world—the Moon—with America's Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Later, the first space station was launched by the Soviet space program. The United States developed the first (and to date only) reusable spacecraft system with the Space Shuttle program, first launched in 1981. As the century ended, a permanent manned presence in space was being founded with the ongoing construction of the International Space Station.\n In addition to human spaceflight, unmanned space probes became a practical and relatively inexpensive form of exploration. The first orbiting space probe, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Over time, a massive system of artificial satellites was placed into orbit around Earth. These satellites greatly advanced navigation, communications, military intelligence, geology, climate, and numerous other fields. Also, by the end of the 20th century, unmanned probes had visited the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and various asteroids and comets. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, greatly expanded our understanding of the Universe and brought brilliant images to TV and computer screens around the world.\n\n Biology and medicine \n\nthumb|right|A stamp commemorating Alexander Fleming. His discovery of penicillin had changed the world of modern medicine by introducing the age of antibiotics.\n\n Genetics was unanimously accepted and significantly developed. The structure of DNA was determined in 1953 by James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, following by developing techniques which allow to read DNA sequences and culminating in starting the Human Genome Project (not finished in the 20th century) and cloning the first mammal in 1996.\n The role of sexual reproduction in evolution was understood, and bacterial conjugation was discovered.\n The convergence of various sciences for the formulation of the modern evolutionary synthesis (produced between 1936 and 1947), providing a widely accepted account of evolution.\n Placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trials became a powerful tool for testing new medicines.\n Antibiotics drastically reduced mortality from bacterial diseases and their prevalence.\n A vaccine was developed for polio, ending a worldwide epidemic.  Effective vaccines were also developed for a number of other serious infectious diseases, including influenza, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), chickenpox, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B.\n Epidemiology and vaccination led to the eradication of the smallpox virus in humans.\n X-rays became powerful diagnostic tool for wide spectrum of diseases, from bone fractures to cancer.  In the 1960s, computerized tomography was invented.  Other important diagnostic tools developed were sonography and magnetic resonance imaging.\n Development of vitamins virtually eliminated scurvy and other vitamin-deficiency diseases from industrialized societies.\n New psychiatric drugs were developed.  These include antipsychotics for treating hallucinations and delusions, and antidepressants for treating depression.\n The role of tobacco smoking in the causation of cancer and other diseases was proven during the 1950s (see British Doctors Study).\n New methods for cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, were developed. As a result, cancer could often be cured or placed in remission.\n The development of blood typing and blood banking made blood transfusion safe and widely available.\n The invention and development of immunosuppressive drugs and tissue typing made organ and tissue transplantation a clinical reality.\n New methods for heart surgery were developed, including pacemakers and artificial hearts.\n Cocaine/crack and heroin were found to be dangerous addictive drugs, and their wide usage had been outlawed; mind-altering drugs such as LSD and MDMA were discovered and later outlawed. In many countries, a war on drugs caused prices to soar 10–20 times higher, leading to profitable black market drugdealing, and to prison inmate sentences being 80% related to drug use by the 1990s.\n Contraceptive drugs were developed, which reduced population growth rates in industrialized countries, as well as decreased the taboo of premarital sex throughout many western countries.\n The development of medical insulin during the 1920s helped raise the life expectancy of diabetics to three times of what it had been earlier.\n Vaccines, hygiene and clean water improved health and decreased mortality rates, especially among infants and the young.\n\n Notable diseases \n\n An influenza pandemic, Spanish Flu, killed anywhere from 20 to 100 million people between 1918 and 1919.\n A new viral disease, called the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, arose in Africa and subsequently killed millions of  people throughout the world. HIV leads to a syndrome called Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Treatments for HIV remained inaccessible to many people living with AIDS and HIV in developing countries, and a cure has yet to be discovered.\n Because of increased life spans, the prevalence of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other diseases of old age increased slightly.\n Sedentary lifestyles, due to labor-saving devices and technology, along with the increase in home entertainment and technology such as television, video games, and the internet contributed to an \"epidemic\" of obesity, at first in the rich countries, but by the end of the 20th century spreading to the developing world.\n\n Chemistry \nthumb|right|270px|The first Solvay Conference was held in Brussels in 1911 and was considered a turning point in the world of physics and chemistry.\n\nIn 1903, Mikhail Tsvet invented chromatography, an important analytic technique. In 1904, Hantaro Nagaoka proposed an early nuclear model of the atom, where electrons orbit a dense massive nucleus. In 1905, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch developed the Haber process for making ammonia, a milestone in industrial chemistry with deep consequences in agriculture. The Haber process, or Haber-Bosch process, combined nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia in industrial quantities for production of fertilizer and munitions. The food production for half the world's current population depends on this method for producing fertilizer. Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born–Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. Haber has also been described as the \"father of chemical warfare\" for his work developing and deploying chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I.\n\nthumb|150px|left|Robert A. Millikan, who is best known for measuring the charge on the electron, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1923.\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein explained Brownian motion in a way that definitively proved atomic theory. Leo Baekeland invented bakelite, one of the first commercially successful plastics. In 1909, American physicist Robert Andrews Millikan - who had studied in Europe under Walther Nernst and Max Planck - measured the charge of individual electrons with unprecedented accuracy through the oil drop experiment, in which he measured the electric charges on tiny falling water (and later oil) droplets. His study established that any particular droplet's electrical charge is a multiple of a definite, fundamental value — the electron's charge — and thus a confirmation that all electrons have the same charge and mass. Beginning in 1912, he spent several years investigating and finally proving Albert Einstein's proposed linear relationship between energy and frequency, and providing the first direct photoelectric support for Planck's constant. In 1923 Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics.\n\nIn 1909, S. P. L. Sørensen invented the pH concept and develops methods for measuring acidity. In 1911, Antonius Van den Broek proposed the idea that the elements on the periodic table are more properly organized by positive nuclear charge rather than atomic weight. In 1911, the first Solvay Conference was held in Brussels, bringing together most of the most prominent scientists of the day. In 1912, William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg proposed Bragg's law and established the field of X-ray crystallography, an important tool for elucidating the crystal structure of substances. In 1912, Peter Debye develops the concept of molecular dipole to describe asymmetric charge distribution in some molecules.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, introduced the concepts of quantum mechanics to atomic structure by proposing what is now known as the Bohr model of the atom, where electrons exist only in strictly defined circular orbits around the nucleus similar to rungs on a ladder. The Bohr Model is a planetary model in which the negatively charged electrons orbit a small, positively charged nucleus similar to the planets orbiting the Sun (except that the orbits are not planar) - the gravitational force of the solar system is mathematically akin to the attractive Coulomb (electrical) force between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons.\n\nIn 1913, Henry Moseley, working from Van den Broek's earlier idea, introduces concept of atomic number to fix inadequacies of Mendeleev's periodic table, which had been based on atomic weight. The peak of Frederick Soddy's career in radiochemistry was in 1913 with his formulation of the concept of isotopes, which stated that certain elements exist in two or more forms which have different atomic weights but which are indistinguishable chemically. He is remembered for proving the existence of isotopes of certain radioactive elements, and is also credited, along with others, with the discovery of the element protactinium in 1917. In 1913, J. J. Thomson expanded on the work of Wien by showing that charged subatomic particles can be separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, a technique known as mass spectrometry.\n\nIn 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis published his seminal article \"The Atom of the Molecule\", which suggested that a chemical bond is a pair of electrons shared by two atoms. Lewis's model equated the classical chemical bond with the sharing of a pair of electrons between the two bonded atoms. Lewis introduced the  \"electron dot diagrams\" in this paper to symbolize the electronic structures of atoms and molecules. Now known as Lewis structures, they are discussed in virtually every introductory chemistry book. Lewis in 1923 developed the electron pair theory of acids and base: Lewis redefined an acid as any atom or molecule with an incomplete octet that was thus capable of accepting electrons from another atom; bases were, of course, electron donors. His theory is known as the concept of Lewis acids and bases. In 1923, G. N. Lewis and Merle Randall published Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances, first modern treatise on chemical thermodynamics.\n\nThe 1920s saw a rapid adoption and application of Lewis's model of the electron-pair bond in the fields of organic and coordination chemistry. In organic chemistry, this was primarily due to the efforts of the British chemists Arthur Lapworth, Robert Robinson, Thomas Lowry, and Christopher Ingold; while in coordination chemistry, Lewis's bonding model was promoted through the efforts of the American chemist Maurice Huggins and the British chemist Nevil Sidgwick.\n\nQuantum chemistry\n\nSome view the birth of quantum chemistry in the discovery of the Schrödinger equation and its application to the hydrogen atom in 1926.  However, the 1927 article of Walter Heitler and Fritz LondonW. Heitler and F. London, Wechselwirkung neutraler Atome und Homöopolare Bindung nach der Quantenmechanik, Z. Physik, 44, 455 (1927). is often recognised as the first milestone in the history of quantum chemistry. This is the first application of quantum mechanics to the diatomic hydrogen molecule, and thus to the phenomenon of the chemical bond. In the following years much progress was accomplished by Edward Teller, Robert S. Mulliken, Max Born, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Linus Pauling, Erich Hückel, Douglas Hartree, Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock, to cite a few.\n\nStill, skepticism remained as to the general power of quantum mechanics applied to complex chemical systems. The situation around 1930 is described by Paul Dirac:P.A.M. Dirac, Quantum Mechanics of Many-Electron Systems, Proc. R. Soc. London, A 123, 714 (1929).\n\nHence the quantum mechanical methods developed in the 1930s and 1940s are often referred to as theoretical molecular or atomic physics to underline the fact that they were more the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry and spectroscopy than answers to chemically relevant questions. In 1951, a milestone article in quantum chemistry is the seminal paper of Clemens C. J. Roothaan on Roothaan equations.C.C.J. Roothaan, A Study of Two-Center Integrals Useful in Calculations on Molecular Structure, J. Chem. Phys., 19, 1445 (1951).  It opened the avenue to the solution of the self-consistent field equations for small molecules like hydrogen or nitrogen.  Those computations were performed with the help of tables of integrals which were computed on the most advanced computers of the time.\n\nIn the 1940s many physicists turned from molecular or atomic physics to nuclear physics (like J. Robert Oppenheimer or Edward Teller). Glenn T. Seaborg was an American nuclear chemist best known for his work on isolating and identifying transuranium elements (those heavier than uranium). He shared the 1951 Nobel Prize for Chemistry with Edwin Mattison McMillan for their independent discoveries of transuranium elements. Seaborgium was named in his honour, making him the only person, along Albert Einstein and Yuri Oganessian, for whom a chemical element was named during his lifetime.\n\nMolecular biology and biochemistry\n\nBy the mid 20th century, in principle, the integration of physics and chemistry was extensive, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom; Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules.  However, though some principles deduced from quantum mechanics were able to predict qualitatively some chemical features for biologically relevant molecules, they were, till the end of the 20th century, more a collection of rules, observations, and recipes than rigorous ab initio quantitative methods.  \nthumb|right|200px|Diagrammatic representation of some key structural features of DNA\nThis heuristic approach triumphed in 1953 when James Watson and Francis Crick deduced the double helical structure of DNA by constructing models constrained by and informed by the knowledge of the chemistry of the constituent parts and the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained by Rosalind Franklin.Watson, J. and Crick, F., \"Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids\" Nature, April 25, 1953, p 737–8   This discovery lead to an explosion of research into the biochemistry of life.\n\nIn the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated that basic constituents of protein, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules in a simulation of primordial processes on Earth.  Though many questions remain about the true nature of the origin of life, this was the first attempt by chemists to study hypothetical processes in the laboratory under controlled conditions.\n\nIn 1983 Kary Mullis devised a method for the in-vitro amplification of DNA, known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which revolutionized the chemical processes used in the laboratory to manipulate it.  PCR could be used to synthesize specific pieces of DNA and made possible the sequencing of DNA of organisms, which culminated in the huge human genome project.\n\nAn important piece in the double helix puzzle was solved by one of Pauling's students Matthew Meselson and Frank Stahl, the result of their collaboration (Meselson–Stahl experiment) has been called as \"the most beautiful experiment in biology\".\n\nThey used a centrifugation technique that sorted molecules according to differences in weight. Because nitrogen atoms are a component of DNA, they were labelled and therefore tracked in replication in bacteria.\n\nLate 20th century\nthumb|right|upright|Buckminsterfullerene, C60\nIn 1970, John Pople developed the Gaussian program greatly easing computational chemistry calculations.W. J. Hehre, W. A. Lathan, R. Ditchfield, M. D. Newton, and J. A. Pople, Gaussian 70 (Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange, Program No. 237, 1970). In 1971, Yves Chauvin offered an explanation of the reaction mechanism of olefin metathesis reactions.Catalyse de transformation des oléfines par les complexes du tungstène. II.

(Article)\nIn 1985, Harold Kroto, Robert Curl and Richard Smalley discovered fullerenes, a class of large carbon molecules superficially resembling the geodesic dome designed by architect R. Buckminster Fuller. In 1991, Sumio Iijima used electron microscopy to discover a type of cylindrical fullerene known as a carbon nanotube, though earlier work had been done in the field as early as 1951.  This material is an important component in the field of nanotechnology. In 1994, Robert A. Holton and his group achieved the first total synthesis of Taxol.First total synthesis of taxol 1.

Abstract In 1995, Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman produced the first Bose–Einstein condensate, a substance that displays quantum mechanical properties on the macroscopic scale.\n\n Engineering and technology \nthumb|right|First flight of the Wright Flyer I, December 17, 1903, Orville piloting, Wilbur running at wingtip.\n\nOne of the prominent traits of the 20th century was the dramatic growth of technology. Organized research and practice of science led to advancement in the fields of communication, engineering, travel, medicine, and war.\n\n The number and types of home appliances increased dramatically due to advancements in technology, electricity availability, and increases in wealth and leisure time. Such basic appliances as washing machines, clothes dryers, furnaces, exercise machines, refrigerators, freezers, electric stoves, and vacuum cleaners all became popular from the 1920s through the 1950s. The microwave oven became popular during the 1980s and have become a standard in all homes by the 1990s. Radios were popularized as a form of entertainment during the 1920s, which extended to television during the 1950s. Cable and satellite television spread rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s. Personal computers began to enter the home during the 1970s–1980s as well. The age of the portable music player grew during the 1960s with the development of the transistor radio,  8-track and cassette tapes, which slowly began to replace record players These were in turn replaced by the CD during the late 1980s and 1990s. The proliferation of the Internet in the mid-to-late 1990s made digital distribution of music (mp3s) possible. VCRs were popularized in the 1970s, but by the end of the 20th century, DVD players were beginning to replace them, making the VHS obsolete by the end of the first decade of the 21st century.\n The first airplane was flown in 1903.  With the engineering of the faster jet engine in the 1940s, mass air travel became commercially viable.\n The assembly line made mass production of the automobile viable. By the end of the 20th century, billions of people had automobiles for personal transportation.  The combination of the automobile, motor boats and air travel allowed for unprecedented personal mobility. In western nations, motor vehicle accidents became the greatest cause of death for young people. However, expansion of divided highways reduced the death rate.\n The triode tube, transistor and integrated circuit successively revolutionized electronics and computers, leading to the proliferation of the personal computer in the 1980s and cell phones and the public-use Internet in the 1990s.\n New materials, most notably stainless steel, Velcro, silicone, teflon, and plastics such as polystyrene, PVC, polyethylene, and nylon came into widespread use for many various applications. These materials typically have tremendous performance gains in strength, temperature, chemical resistance, or mechanical properties over those known prior to the 20th century.\nAluminum became an inexpensive metal and became second only to iron in use.\nSemiconductor materials were discovered, and methods of production and purification developed for use in electronic devices. Silicon became one of the purest substances ever produced.\n Thousands of chemicals were developed for industrial processing and home use.\n\n Mathematics \n\nThe 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the Mathematics Subject Classification was dozens of pages long.Mathematics Subject Classification 2000  Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry.  More and more mathematical journals were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the World Wide Web led to online publishing. Mathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the classification of finite simple groups (also called the \"enormous theorem\"), whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages.\n\nIn a 1900 speech to the International Congress of Mathematicians, David Hilbert set out a list of 23 unsolved problems in mathematics. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.\n\nIn 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the natural numbers plus one of addition and multiplication, was decidable, i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, Kurt Gödel found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as Peano arithmetic, was in fact incompletable. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of number theory, including the notion of prime number.) A consequence of Gödel's two incompleteness theorems is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of analysis and geometry), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that cannot be proved within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and David Hilbert's dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.\n\nIn 1963, Paul Cohen proved that the continuum hypothesis is independent of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the standard axioms of set theory. In 1976, Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel used a computer to prove the four color theorem. Andrew Wiles, building on the work of others, proved Fermat's Last Theorem in 1995. In 1998 Thomas Callister Hales proved the Kepler conjecture.\n\nthumb|Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star, with relativistic precession of apsides\nDifferential geometry came into its own when Einstein used it in general relativity. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as mathematical logic, topology, and John von Neumann's game theory changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of structures were abstracted using axioms and given names like metric spaces, topological spaces etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to category theory. Grothendieck and Serre recast algebraic geometry using sheaf theory. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of dynamical systems that Poincaré had begun in the 1890s.\nMeasure theory was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the Lebesgue integral, Kolmogorov's axiomatisation of probability theory, and ergodic theory. Knot theory greatly expanded. Quantum mechanics led to the development of functional analysis. Other new areas include Laurent Schwartz's distribution theory, fixed point theory, singularity theory and René Thom's catastrophe theory, model theory, and Mandelbrot's fractals. Lie theory with its Lie groups and Lie algebras became one of the major areas of study.\n\nNon-standard analysis, introduced by Abraham Robinson, rehabilitated the infinitesimal approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of limits, by extending the field of real numbers to the Hyperreal numbers which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the surreal numbers were discovered by John Horton Conway in connection with combinatorial games.\n\nThe development and continual improvement of computers, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed industry to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: Alan Turing's computability theory; complexity theory; Derrick Henry Lehmer's use of ENIAC to further number theory and the Lucas-Lehmer test; Rózsa Péter's recursive function theory; Claude Shannon's information theory; signal processing; data analysis; optimization and other areas of operations research. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on calculus and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of discrete concepts and the expansion of combinatorics including graph theory. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as numerical analysis and symbolic computation. Some of the most important methods and algorithms of the 20th century are: the simplex algorithm, the Fast Fourier Transform, error-correcting codes, the Kalman filter from control theory and the RSA algorithm of public-key cryptography.\n\n Physics \n\n New areas of physics, like special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics, were developed during the first half of the century. In the process, the internal structure of atoms came to be clearly understood, followed by the discovery of elementary particles.\n It was found that all the known forces can be traced to only four fundamental interactions. It was discovered further that two forces, electromagnetism and weak interaction, can be merged in the electroweak interaction, leaving only three different fundamental interactions.\n Discovery of nuclear reactions, in particular nuclear fusion, finally revealed the source of solar energy.\nRadiocarbon dating was invented, and became a powerful technique for determining the age of prehistoric animals and plants as well as historical objects.\n\nQuantum mechanics\n\nIn 1924, French quantum physicist Louis de Broglie published his thesis, in which he introduced a revolutionary theory of electron waves based on wave–particle duality in his thesis. In his time, the wave and particle interpretations of light and matter were seen as being at odds with one another, but de Broglie suggested that these seemingly different characteristics were instead the same behavior observed from different perspectives — that particles can behave like waves, and waves (radiation) can behave like particles.  Broglie's proposal offered an explanation of the restriction motion of electrons within the atom. The first publications of Broglie's idea of \"matter waves\" had drawn little attention from other physicists, but a copy of his doctoral thesis chanced to reach Einstein, whose response was enthusiastic. Einstein stressed the importance of Broglie's work both explicitly and by building further on it.\n\nIn 1925, Austrian-born physicist Wolfgang Pauli developed the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons around a single nucleus in an atom can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously, as described by four quantum numbers. Pauli made major contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory - he was awarded the 1945 Nobel Prize for Physics for his discovery of the Pauli exclusion principle - as well as solid-state physics, and he successfully hypothesized the existence of the neutrino. In addition to his original work, he wrote masterful syntheses of several areas of physical theory that are considered classics of scientific literature.\n\nthumb|left|180px|The Schrödinger equation\nIn 1926 at the age of 39, Austrian theoretical physicist Erwin Schrödinger produced the papers that gave the foundations of quantum wave mechanics. In those papers he described his partial differential equation that is the basic equation of quantum mechanics and bears the same relation to the mechanics of the atom as Newton's equations of motion bear to planetary astronomy. Adopting a proposal made by Louis de Broglie in 1924 that particles of matter have a dual nature and in some situations act like waves, Schrödinger introduced a theory describing the behaviour of such a system by a wave equation that is now known as the Schrödinger equation. The solutions to Schrödinger's equation, unlike the solutions to Newton's equations, are wave functions that can only be related to the probable occurrence of physical events. The readily visualized sequence of events of the planetary orbits of Newton is, in quantum mechanics, replaced by the more abstract notion of probability. (This aspect of the quantum theory made Schrödinger and several other physicists profoundly unhappy, and he devoted much of his later life to formulating philosophical objections to the generally accepted interpretation of the theory that he had done so much to create.)\n\nGerman theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg was one of the key creators of quantum mechanics. In 1925, Heisenberg discovered a way to formulate quantum mechanics in terms of matrices. For that discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for 1932. In 1927 he published his uncertainty principle, upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known. Heisenberg was able to demonstrate that if you were studying an electron in an atom you could say where it was (the electron's location) or where it was going (the electron's velocity), but it was impossible to express both at the same time. He also made important contributions to the theories of the hydrodynamics of turbulent flows, the atomic nucleus, ferromagnetism, cosmic rays, and subatomic particles, and he was instrumental in planning the first West German nuclear reactor at Karlsruhe, together with a research reactor in Munich, in 1957.

    "text": "In a foundational controversy in twentieth-century mathematics, L. E. J. Brouwer, a supporter of intuitionism, opposed David Hilbert, the founder of formalism.\n\n Background \nThe background for the controversy was set with David Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry in the late 1890s. In his biography of Kurt Gödel, John W. Dawson, Jr summarizes the result as follows: \"At issue in the sometimes bitter disputes was the relation of mathematics to logic, as well as fundamental questions of methodology, such as how quantifiers were to be construed, to what extent, if at all, nonconstructive methods were justified, and whether there were important connections to be made between syntactic and semantic notions.\"Dawson 1997:48\n\nDawson observes that \"partisans of three principal philosophical positions took part in the debate\" – the logicists (Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell), the formalists (David Hilbert and his \"school\" of collaborators), and the constructivists (Henri Poincaré and Hermann Weyl); within this constructivist school was the radical self-named \"intuitionist\" L.E.J. Brouwer.\n\n Brief history of Brouwer and Intuitionism \nBrouwer in effect founded the mathematical philosophy of intuitionism as a challenge to the then-prevailing formalism of David Hilbert and his collaborators Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, John von Neumann and others.cf. Kleene (1952), pp. 46–59 As a variety of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is essentially a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics.  It is sometimes and rather simplistically characterized by saying that its adherents refuse to use the law of excluded middle in mathematical reasoning.\n\nIn 1908: \"... Brouwer, in a paper entitled \"The untrustworthiness of the principles of logic\", challenged the belief that the rules of the classical logic, which have come down to us essentially from Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) have an absolute validity, independent of the subject matter to which they are applied\".Kleene (1952), p. 46\n\n\"After completing his dissertation (1907: see Van Dalen), Brouwer made a conscious decision temporarily to keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess\" (Davis (2000), p. 95); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the Fixed Point Theorem. Hilbert – the formalist with whom the intuitionist Brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict – admired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment (1912) at the University of Amsterdam.Davis, p. 96 It was then that \"Brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling intuitionism\".\n\nIn the later 1920s, Brouwer became involved in a public and demeaning controversy with Hilbert over editorial policy at Mathematische Annalen, at that time a leading learned journal.Cf. . He became relatively isolated; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student Arend Heyting.\n\nOrigins of disagreement\nThe nature of Hilbert's proof of the Hilbert basis theorem (dating from 1888) turned out to be more controversial than Hilbert could have imagined at the time. Although Kronecker had conceded, Hilbert would later respond to others' similar criticisms that \"many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea\" — in other words (to quote Reid): \"Through a proof of existence, Hilbert had been able to obtain a construction\"; \"the proof\" (i.e. the symbols on the page) was \"the object\".Reid 1996, p. 37\n\nNot all were convinced. While Kronecker would die soon after, his constructivist banner would be carried forward by sharp criticism from Poincaré, and later in full cry by the young Brouwer and his developing intuitionist \"school\"—Weyl in particular, much to Hilbert's torment in his later years (Reid 1996, pp. 148–149).  Indeed, Hilbert lost his \"gifted pupil\" Weyl to intuitionism: \"Hilbert was disturbed by his former student's fascination with the ideas of Brouwer, which aroused in Hilbert the memory of Kronecker.\"Reid 1996, p. 148\n\nBrouwer the intuitionist in particular objected to the use of the Law of Excluded Middle over infinite sets (as Hilbert had indeed used it). Hilbert would respond: \"'Taking the Principle of the Excluded Middle from the mathematician ... is the same as ... prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists.'This quote appears in numerous sources. A translation of the original can be found in van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927) p. 476 and reads as follows: \"Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists. To prohibit existence statements and the principle of excluded middle is tantamount to relinquishing the science of mathematics altogether.\" \"The possible loss did not seem to bother Weyl.\"Reid 1996, p. 150\n\nValidity of the law of excluded middle\nIn the same paper – the text of an address delivered in 1927cf. van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927) – Hilbert clearly expresses himself. At first he attempts to defend his axiomatic system as having \"important general philosophical significance\".van Heijenoort: Hilbert 1927 p. 475 For him, the statement of \"definite rules\" expresses \"the technique of our thinking\". Nothing is hidden, no tacit assumptions are admitted: \"after all, it is part of the task of science to liberate us from arbitrariness, sentiment and habit, and to protect us from the subjectivism that ... finds its culmination in intuitionism\".\n\nBut then Hilbert gets to the nub of it – the proscription of the law of excluded middle (LoEM): :\"Intuitionism's sharpest and most passionate challenge is the one it flings at the validity of the principle of excluded middle ... .\"\n\nTo doubt the LoEM—when extended over the completed infinite—was to doubt Hilbert's axiomatic system, in particular his \"logical ε-axiom\".He presents the ε-axiom in his 1927 address/paper. This \"existence\"-axiom asserts the existence of an object of discourse: \"A(a) → A(ε(A)). Here ε(A) stands for an object of which the proposition A(a) certainly holds if it holds of any object at all ... .\"(van Heijenoort p. 466). Immediately he goes on to demonstrate how the notions \"for all\" (the modern universal quantifier \"∀\") and \"there exists\" (the modern existential quantifier \"∃\") derive from this axiom. To take away the LoEM was to destroy the \"science of mathematics\". Finally, Hilbert singles out one man—by implication, not by name—for the cause of his present tribulation: \"... I am astonished that a mathematician should doubt that the principle of excluded middle is strictly valid as a mode of inference. I am even more astonished that, as it seems, a whole community of mathematicians who do the same has so constituted itself. I am most astonished by the fact that even in mathematical circles the power of suggestion of a single man, however full of temperament and inventiveness, is capable of having the most improbable and eccentric effects.\"van Heijenoort: Hilbert 1927 p. 476\n\nBrouwer answers pique with pique: \"... formalism has received nothing but benefactions from intuitionism and may expect further benefactions. The formalistic school should therefore accord some recognition to intuitionism, instead of polemicizing against it in sneering tones, while not even observing proper mention of authorship.\"van Heijenoort: Brouwer 1927b published in 1928, p. 492\n\n Deeper philosophic differences \n\n A philosophical defeat in the quest for \"truth\" in the choice of axioms \n\nHowever \"truth\" is ultimately defined, for a few mathematicians Hilbert's formalism seemed to eschew the notion. And at least with respect to his choice of axioms the case can be made that indeed he does eschew the notion. The fundamental issue is just how does one choose \"the axioms\"? Until Hilbert proposed his formalism, the axioms were chosen on an \"intuitive\" (experiential) basis. Aristotelian logic is a good example – based on one's life-experiences it just seems \"logical\" that an object of discourse either has a stated property (e.g. \"This truck is yellow\") or it does not have that property (\"This truck is not yellow\") but not both simultaneously (the Aristotelian Law of Non-Contradiction). The primitive form of the induction axiom is another – if a predicate P(n) is true for n = 0 and if for all natural numbers n, if P(n) being true implies that P(n+1) is true, then P(n) is true for all natural numbers n.\n\nHilbert's axiomatic system – his formalism – is different. At the outset it declares its axioms.Hilbert's writing is clean and accessible: for a list of his axioms and his \"construction\" see the first pages of van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927). But he doesn't require the selection of these axioms to be based upon either \"common sense\", a priori knowledge (intuitively derived understanding or awareness, innate knowledge seen as \"truth without requiring any proof from experience\"Bertrand Russell 1912: 74 ), or observational experience (empirical data). Rather, the mathematician in the same manner as the theoretical physicistOne of Hilbert's problems for the twentieth century was to \"axiomatize physics\" presumably in the same way he was attempting to \"axiomatize\" mathematics.Weyl in his 1927 comments on Hilbert's address discusses theoretical physics as a science with \"individual assumptions and laws [that] have no meaning that can immediately be realized in intuition...](van Heijenoort p. 484) is free to adopt any (arbitrary, abstract) collection of axioms that they so choose. Indeed, Weyl asserts that Hilbert had \"formaliz[ed] it [classical mathematics], thus transforming it in principle from a system of intuitive results into a game with formulas that proceeds according to fixed rules\".van Heijenoort p. 483 So, Weyl asks, what might guide the choice of these rules? \"What impels us to take as a basis precisely the particular axiom system developed by Hilbert?\". Weyl offers up \"consistency is indeed a necessary but not sufficient condition\" but he cannot answer more completely except to note that Hilbert's \"construction\" is \"arbitrary and bold\". Finally he notes, in italics, that the philosophical result of Hilbert's \"construction\" will be the following: \"If Hilbert's view prevails over intuitionism, as appears to be the case, then I see in this a decisive defeat of the philosophical attitude of pure phenomenology, which thus proves to be insufficient for the understanding of creative science even in the area of cognition that is most primal and most readily open to evidence – mathematics.\"\n\nIn other words: the role of innate feelings and tendencies (intuition) and observational experience (empiricism) in the choice of axioms will be removed except in the global sense – the \"construction\" had better work when put to the test: \"only the theoretical system as a whole ... can be confronted with experience\".\n\n The Law of Excluded Middle extended to the infinite \nCantor (1897) extended the intuitive notion of \"the infinite\" – one foot placed after the other in a never-ending march toward the horizon – to the notion of \"a completed infinite\" – the arrival \"all the way, way out there\" in one fell swoop, and he symbolized this notion with a single sign ℵ0 (aleph-null). Hilbert's adoption of the notion wholesale was \"thoughtless\", Brouwer believed. Brouwer in his (1927a) \"Intuitionistic reflections on formalism\" states: \"SECOND INSIGHT The rejection of the thoughtless use of the logical principle of the excluded middle, as well as the recognition, first, of the fact that the investigation of the question why the principle mentioned is justified and to what extent it is valid constitutes an essential object of research in the foundations of mathematics, and, second, of the fact that in intuitive (contentual) mathematics this principle is valid only for finite systems. THIRD INSIGHT. The identification of the principle of excluded middle with the principle of the solvability of every mathematical problem\".van Heijenoort, p. 491\n\nThis Third Insight is referring to Hilbert's second problem and Hilbert's ongoing attempt to axiomatize all of arithmetic, and with this system, to discover a \"consistency proof\" for all of mathematics – see more below. So into this fray (started by Poincaré) Brouwer plunged head-long, with Weyl as back-up.\n\nTheir first complaint (Brouwer's Second Insight, above) arose from Hilbert's extension of Aristotle's \"Law of Excluded Middle\" (and \"double negation\") – hitherto restricted to finite domains of Aristotelian discourse – to infinite domains of discourseSee the lead paragraphs of van Heijenoort: Brouwer (1923b) p. 335.\". In the late 1890s Hilbert successfully axiomatized geometry.Breger states that \"Modern mathematics starts with Hilbert's Grundlagen der Geometrie\" (p. 226). Then he went on to successfully (or so Hilbert thought) use the Cantorian-inspired notion of the completed infinity to produce elegant, radically abbreviated proofs in analysis (1896 and afterwards).Brouwer baldly itemizes the many other places where he thinks Hilbert has gone wrong, cf. van Heijenoort p. 491–492. In his own words of defense Hilbert believed himself quite justified in what he had done (in the following he calls this type of proof an existence proof): \"...I stated a general theorem (1896) on algebraic forms that is a pure existence statement and by its very nature cannot be transformed into a statement involving constructibility. Purely by use of this existence theorem I avoided the lengthy and unclear argumentation of Weierstrass and the highly complicated calculations of Dedekind, and in addition, I believe, only my proof uncovers the inner reason for the validity of the assertions adumbrated by GaussThis is a sly poke at the finitists: \"Empiricist philosophers, such as Hobbes, Locke, and Hume, had convinced some mathematicians, such as Gauss, that there is no infinite in mathematics\" (Anglin p. 213). and formulated by Weierstrass and Dedekind.\"Anglin, p. 474 \"The value of pure existence proofs consists precisely in that the individual construction is eliminated by them and that many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea, so that only what is essential to the proof stands out clearly; brevity and economy of thought are the raison d'être of existence proofs.\"Anglin, p. 475\n\nWhat Hilbert had to give up was \"constructibility\" – his proofs would not produce \"objects\" (except for the proofs themselves – i.e. symbol strings), but rather they would produce contradictions of the premises and have to proceed by reductio ad absurdum extended over the infinite.\n\n Hilbert's quest for a generalized proof of consistency of the axioms of arithmetic \nBrouwer viewed this loss of constructibility as bad, but worse when applied to a generalized \"proof of consistency\" for all of mathematics.  In his 1900 address Hilbert had specified, as the second of his 23 problems for the twentieth century, the quest for a generalized proof of (procedure for determining) the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic.  Hilbert, unlike Brouwer, believed that the formalized notion of mathematical induction could be applied in the search for the generalized consistency proof.\n\nA consequence of this marvelous proof/procedure P would be the following: Given any arbitrary mathematical theorem T (formula, procedure, proof) put to P (thus P(T)) including P itself (thus P(P)), P would determine conclusively whether or not the theorem T (and P) was provable – i.e. derivable from its premises, the axioms of arithmetic. Thus for all T, T would be provable by P or not provable by P and under all conditions (i.e. for any assignment of numerical values to T's variables). This is a perfect illustration of the use of the Law of Excluded Middle extended over the infinite, in fact extended twice – first over all theorems (formulas, procedures, proofs) and secondly for a given theorem, for all assignment of its variables. This point, missed by Hilbert, was first pointed out to him by Poincaré and later by Weyl in his 1927 comments on Hilbert's lecture: \"For after all Hilbert, too, is not merely concerned with, say 0' or 0' ', but with any 0' ... ', with an arbitrarily concretely given numeral. One may here stress the \"concretely given\"; on the other hand, it is just as essential that the contentual arguments in proof theory be carried out in hypothetical generality, on any proof, on any numeral. ... It seems to me that Hilbert's proof theory shows Poincaré to have been completely right on this point.\"Weyl 1927, van Heijenoort p. 483\n\nIn his discussion preceding Weyl's 1927 comments van Heijenoort explains that Hilbert insisted that he had addressed the issue of \"whether a formula, taken as an axiom, leads to a contradiction, the question is whether a proof that leads to a contradiction can be presented to me\".Weyl 1927, van Heijenoort p. 481\n \"But [writes van Heijenoort] in a consistency proof the argument does not deal with one single specific formula; it has to be extended to all formulas. This is the point that Weyl has in mind ... .\"Nagel and Newman note: \"In the various attempts to solve the problem of consistency there is one persistent source of difficulty. It lies in the fact that the axioms are interpreted by models composed of an infinite number of elements. This makes it impossible to encompass the models in a finite number of observations . . . the conclusion that the argument seeks to establish involves an extrapolation from a finite to an infinite set of data. How can we justify this jump? ... Unfortunately, most of the postulate systems that constitute the foundations of important branches of mathematics cannot be mirrored in finite models.\" Nagel and Newman go on to give the example of the successor function ' (Gödel used f, the old-English symbol for s) – given starting-point 0, thereafter 0', 0, etc creates the infinity of integers. (p. 21–22) In response to this, Hilbert attempted an absolute proof of consistency – it would not presume the consistency of another system outside the one of interest, but rather, the system would begin with a [finite] collection of strings of discrete symbols (the axioms) and formation rules to manipulate those symbols. (cf p. 26ff)\"\n\nIf successful the quest would result in a remarkable outcome: Given such a generalized proof, all mathematics could be replaced by an automaton consisting of two parts: (i) a formula-generator to create formulas one after the other, followed by (ii) the generalized consistency proof, which would yield \"Yes – valid (i.e. provable)\" or \"No – not valid (not provable)\" for each formula submitted to it (and every possible assignment of numbers to its variables). In other words: mathematics would cease as a creative enterprise and become a machine.Breger notes: \"Poincaré was not the only one to compare mathematics to a machine without an operator ... Frege claimed that he could not find out by Hilbert's axioms [of geometry] whether his watch fob was a point or not.\" (p. 227)\n\n The problem of the Law of Excluded Middle with respect to induction \nIn van Heijenoort's commentary preceding Weyl's (1927) \"Comments on Hilbert's second lecture on the foundations of mathematics\" Poincaré points out to Hilbert (1905) that there are two types of \"induction\" (1) the intuitive animal-logic foot-following-foot version that gives us a sense that there's always another footstep after the last footstep, and (2) the formal version – e.g. Peano's version: a string of symbols.cf Russell 1912's chapter VI Induction p.60–69, where he discusses animal logic and the problem of knowing a truth and formulating natural laws. The gang of three – Poincaré, Weyl and Brouwer – claimed that Hilbert tacitly, and unjustifiably, adopted as one of his premises formal induction (the symbol string). Poincaré (1905) asserted that, by doing this, Hilbert's reasoning became circular.cf. van Heijenoort's commentary on Weyl (1927). Weyl's (1927) agreement and Brouwer's polemics ultimately forced Hilbert and his disciples Herbrand, Bernays and Ackermann to reexamine their notion of \"induction\" – to eschew the assumption of a \"totality of all the objects x of an infinite collection\" and (intuitionistically) assume that the general argument proceeds one x after another, ad infinitum (van Heijenoort p. 481, footnote a). This is in fact the so-called \"induction schema\" used in the notion of \"recursion\" that was still in development at this time (cf. van Heijenoort p. 493)\"Recursion\" had been around at least since Peano provided his definition of the addition of numbers (cf. van Heijenoort p. 95, Definition 18). – this schema was acceptable to the intuitionists because it had been derived from \"the intuition\".\n\nTo carry this distinction further, Kleene 1952/1977 distinguishes between three types of mathematical induction – (1) the formal Induction Rule (Peano's axiom, see the next section for an example), (2) the inductive definition (examples: counting, \"Proof by induction\"), and (3) the definition by induction (recursive definition of \"number-theoretic functions or predicates). With regards to (3), Kleene considers primitive recursive functions:\n\n Echoes of the controversy \nBrouwer's insistence on \"constructibility\" in the search for a \"consistency proof for arithmetic\" resulted in sensitivity to the issue as reflected by the work of Finsler and Gödel.Dawson notes that \"Brouwer's role in stimulating Gödel's thought seems beyond doubt, [but] how Gödel became aware of Brouwer's work remains uncertain\" (Dawson 1997:55). Ultimately Gödel would \"numeralize\" his formulae; Gödel then used primitive recursion (and its instantiation of the intuitive, constructive form of induction – i.e. counting and step-by-step evaluation) rather than a string of symbols that represent formal induction. Gödel was so sensitive to this issue that he took great pains in his 1931 to point out that his Theorem VI (the so-called \"First incompleteness theorem\") \"is constructive;45a, that is, the following has been proved in an intuitionistically unobjectionable manner ... .\" He then demonstrates what he believes to be the constructive nature of his \"generalization formula\" 17 Gen r. Footnote 45a reinforces his point.\n\nGödel's 1931 does include the formalist's symbol-version of the Peano Induction Axiom; it looks like this, where \".\" is the logical AND, f is the successor-sign, x2 is a function, x1 is a variable, x1Π designates \"for all values of variable x1\":\n (x2(0).x1Π(x2(x1)⊃x2(fx1))⊃x1Π(x2(x1))\nBut he does not appear to use this in the formalist's sense.\n\nNote that there is contention around this point. Gödel specifies this symbol string in his I.3.,p. 600 in van Heijenoort i.e. the formalized inductive axiom appears as shown above – yet even this string can be \"numeralized\" using Gödel's method. On the other hand, he doesn't appear to use this axiom. Rather, his recursion steps through integers assigned to variable k (cf his (2) on page 602). His skeleton-proof of Theorem V, however, \"use(s) induction on the degree of φ\", and uses \"the induction hypothesis\". Without a full proof of this, we are left to assume that his use of the \"induction hypothesis\" is the intuitive version, not the symbolic axiom. His recursion simply steps up the degree of the functions, an intuitive act, ad infinitum. But Nagel and Newman note that Gödel's proofs are infinitary in nature,cf Nagel and Newman p. 98 not finitary as Hilbert requested (see Hilbert's second problem) while Gödel insisted that they are intuitionistically satisfactory. These are not incompatible truths, as long as the LoEM over the infinite isn't invoked anywhere in the proofs.\n\nDespite the last-half-twentieth century's continued abstraction of mathematics,Anglin says it this way: \"In the twentieth century, there was a great deal of concrete, practical mathematics. ... On the other hand, much twentieth century mathematics was characterized by a degree of abstraction never seen before. It was not the Euclidean plane that was studied, but the vector spaces and topological spaces which are abstractions of it. It was not particular groups that were studied so much as the whole 'category' of groups.\" (Anglin 1994:217) the issue has not entirely gone away. Here are two examples. First, the premises of an argument – even ones considered beyond questioning – are always fair game. A hard look at the premises of Turing's 1936–7 led Robin Gandy (1980) to propose his \"principles for mechanisms\" that throw in the speed of light as a constraint. Secondly, Breger (2000) in his \"Tacit Knowledge and Mathematical Progress\" delves deeply into the matter of \"semantics versus syntax\" – in his paper Hilbert, Poincaré, Frege, and Weyl duly make their appearances. He examines a core problem: in axiomatic proofs the tacit assumption of an experienced, thinking mind: to be successful it must come to the argument equipped with prior knowledge of the symbols and their use (the semantics behind the mindless syntax): \"Mathematics as a purely formal system of symbols without a human being possessing the know-how for dealing with the symbols is impossible [according to the chemist Polanyi (1969, 195), the ideal of a form of knowledge that is strictly explicit is contradictory because without tacit knowledge all formulas, words, and illustrations would become meaningless]\" (brackets in the original, Breger 2000:229).\n\nKleene on Brouwer–Hilbert\n\nA serious study of this foundational controversy can be found in Stephen Kleene's Introduction to Metamathematics, particularly in Chapter III: A critique of mathematical reasoning. He discusses §11. The paradoxes, §12. First inferences from the paradoxes [impredicative definitions, Logicism etc.], §13. Intuitionism, §14. Formalism, §15. Formalization of a theory.  Kleene takes the debate seriously, and throughout his book he actually builds the two \"formal systems\", e.g. on page 119 he shows those logical laws such as double negation that are disallowed in the intuitionist system.\n\n Notes \n\n Bibliography \n W.S.

Basically, a set is a Caccioppoli set if its characteristic function is a function of bounded variation.\n\n History \nThe basic concept of a Caccioppoli set was firstly introduced by the Italian mathematician Renato Caccioppoli in the paper : considering a plane set or a surface defined on an open set in the plane, he defined their measure or area as the total variation in the sense of Tonelli of their defining functions, i.e. of their parametric equations, provided this quantity was bounded. The measure of the boundary of a set was defined as a functional, precisely a set function, for the first time: also, being defined on open sets, it can be defined on all Borel sets and its value can be approximated by the values it takes  on an increasing net of subsets. Another clearly stated (and demonstrated) property of this functional was its lower semi-continuity.\n\nIn the paper , he precised  by using a triangular mesh as an increasing net approximating the open domain, defining positive and negative variations whose sum is the total variation, i.e. the area functional. His inspiring point of view, as he explicitly admitted, was those of Giuseppe Peano, as expressed by the Peano-Jordan Measure: to associate to every portion of a surface an oriented plane area in a similar way as an approximating chord is associated to a curve. Also, another theme found in this theory was the extension of a functional from a subspace to the whole ambient space: the use of theorems generalizing the Hahn–Banach theorem is frequently encountered in Caccioppoli research. However, the restricted meaning of total variation in the sense of Tonelli added much complication to the formal development of the theory, and the use of a parametric description of the sets restricted its scope.\n\nLamberto Cesari introduced the \"right\" generalization of functions of bounded variation to the case of several variables only in 1936:In the paper . See the entries \"Bounded variation\" and \"Total variation\" for more details. perhaps, this was one of the reasons that induced Caccioppoli to present an improved version of his theory only nearly 24 years later, in the talk  at the IV UMI Congress in October 1951, followed by five notes published in the Rendiconti of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei. These notes were sharply criticized by Laurence Chisholm Young in the Mathematical Reviews.See .\n\nIn 1952 Ennio de Giorgi presented his first results, developing the ideas of Caccioppoli, on the definition of the measure of boundaries of sets at the Salzburg Congress of the Austrian Mathematical Society: he obtained this results by using a smoothing operator, analogous to a mollifier, constructed from the Gaussian function, independently proving some results of Caccioppoli. Probably he was led to study this theory by his teacher and friend Mauro Picone, who had also been the teacher of Caccioppoli and was likewise his friend. De Giorgi met Caccioppoli in 1953 for the first time: during their meeting, Caccioppoli expressed a profound appreciation of his work, starting their lifelong friendship.It lasted up to the tragic death of Caccioppoli in 1959. The same year he published his first paper on the topic i.e. : however, this paper and the closely following one did not attracted much interest from the mathematical community. It was only with the paper , reviewed again by Laurence Chisholm Young in the Mathematical Reviews,See . that his approach to sets of finite perimeter became widely known and appreciated: also, in the review, Young revised  his previous criticism on the work of Caccioppoli.\n\nThe last paper of De Giorgi on the theory of perimeters was published in 1958: in 1959, after the death of Caccioppoli, he started to call sets of finite perimeter \"Caccioppoli sets\". Two years later Herbert Federer and Wendell Fleming published their paper , changing the approach to the theory. Basically they introduced two new kind of currents, respectively normal currents and integral currents: in a subsequent series of papers and in his famous treatise,See . Federer showed that Caccioppoli sets are normal currents of dimension  in -dimensional euclidean spaces. However, even if the theory of Caccioppoli sets can be studied within the framework of theory of currents, it is customary to study it through the \"traditional\" approach using functions of bounded variation, as the various sections found in a lot of important monographs in mathematics and mathematical physics testify.See the \"References\" section.\n\n Formal definition \nIn what follows, the definition and properties of functions of bounded variation in the -dimensional setting will be used.\n\n Caccioppoli definition \nDefinition 1. Let  be an open subset of  and let  be a Borel set. The perimeter of  in  is defined as follows\n\nwhere  is the characteristic function of . That is, the perimeter of  in an open set  is defined to be the total variation of its characteristic function on that open set. If , then we write  for the (global) perimeter.\n\nDefinition 2. The Borel set  is a Caccioppoli set if and only if it has finite perimeter in every bounded open subset  of , i.e.\n\n whenever  is open and bounded.\n\nTherefore, a Caccioppoli set has a characteristic function whose total variation is locally bounded. From the theory of functions of bounded variation it is known that this implies the existence of a vector-valued Radon measure  such that\n\nAs noted for the case of general functions of bounded variation, this vector measure  is the distributional or weak gradient of . The total variation measure associated with  is denoted by , i.e. for every open set  we write  for .\n\n De Giorgi definition \nIn his papers  and , Ennio de Giorgi introduces the following smoothing operator, analogous to the Weierstrass transform in the one-dimensional case\n\nAs one can easily prove,  is a smooth function for all , such that\n\nalso, its gradient is everywhere well defined, and so is its absolute value\n\nHaving defined this function, De Giorgi gives the following definition of perimeter:\n\nDefinition 3. Let  be an open subset of  and let  be a Borel set. The perimeter of  in  is the value\n\nActually De Giorgi considered the case : however, the extension to the general case is not difficult. It can be proved that the two definitions are exactly equivalent: for a proof see the already cited De Giorgi's papers or the book . Now having defined what a perimeter is, De Giorgi gives the same definition 2 of what a set of (locally) finite perimeter is.\n\n Basic properties \n\nThe following properties are the ordinary properties which the general notion of a perimeter is supposed to have:\n\n If  then , with equality holding if and only if the closure of  is a compact subset of .\n For any two Cacciopoli sets  and , the relation  holds, with equality holding if and only if , where  is the distance between sets in euclidean space.\n If the Lebesgue measure of  is , then : this implies that if the symmetric difference  of two sets has zero Lebesgue measure, the two sets have the same perimeter i.e. .\n\n Notions of boundary \n\nFor any given Caccioppoli set  there exist two naturally associated analytic quantities: the vector-valued Radon measure  and its total variation measure . Given that\n\nis the perimeter within any open set , one should expect that  alone should somehow account for the perimeter of .\n\n The topological boundary \n\nIt is natural to try to understand the relationship between the objects , , and the topological boundary . There is an elementary lemma that guarantees that the support (in the sense of distributions) of , and therefore also , is always contained in :\n\nLemma. The support of the vector-valued Radon measure  is a subset of the topological boundary  of .\n\nProof. To see this choose : then  belongs to the open set  and this implies that it belongs to an open neighborhood  contained in the interior of  or in the interior of . Let . If  where  is the closure of , then  for  and\n\nLikewise, if  then  for  so\n\nWith  arbitrary it follows that  is outside the support of .\n\n The reduced boundary \n\nThe topological boundary  turns out to be too crude for Caccioppoli sets because its Hausdorff measure overcompensates for the perimeter  defined above. Indeed, the Caccioppoli set\n\nrepresenting a square together with a line segment sticking out on the left has perimeter , i.e. the extraneous line segment is ignored, while its topological boundary\n\nhas one-dimensional Hausdorff measure .\n\nThe \"correct\" boundary should therefore be a subset of . We define:\n\nDefinition 4. The reduced boundary of a Caccioppoli set  is denoted by  and is defined to be equal to be the collection of points  at which the limit:\n\nexists and has length equal to one, i.e. .\n\nOne can remark that by the Radon-Nikodym Theorem the reduced boundary  is necessarily contained in the support of , which in turn is contained in the topological boundary  as explained in the section above. That is:\n\nThe inclusions above are not necessarily equalities as the previous example shows. In that example,  is the square with the segment sticking out,  is the square, and  is the square without its four corners.\n\n De Giorgi's theorem \n\nFor convenience, in this section we treat only the case where , i.e. the set  has (globally) finite perimeter. De Giorgi's theorem provides geometric intuition for the notion of reduced boundaries and confirms that it is the more natural definition for Caccioppoli sets by showing\n\ni.e. that its Hausdorff measure equals the perimeter of the set. The statement of the theorem is quite long because it interrelates various geometric notions in one fell swoop.\n\nTheorem. Suppose  is a Caccioppoli set. Then at each point  of the reduced boundary  there exists a multiplicity one approximate tangent space  of , i.e. a codimension-1 subspace  of  such that\n\nfor every continuous, compactly supported . In fact the subspace  is the orthogonal complement of the unit vector\n\ndefined previously. This unit vector also satisfies\n\nlocally in , so it is interpreted as an approximate inward pointing unit normal vector to the reduced boundary . Finally,  is (n-1)-rectifiable and the restriction of (n-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure  to  is , i.e.\n\n for all Borel sets .\n\nIn other words, up to -measure zero the reduced boundary  is the smallest set on which  is supported.\n\n Applications \n\n A Gauss–Green formula \nFrom the definition of the vector Radon measure  and from the properties of the perimeter, the following formula holds true:\n\nThis is one version of the divergence theorem for domains with non smooth boundary. De Giorgi's theorem can be used to formulate the same identity in terms of the reduced boundary  and the approximate inward pointing unit normal vector . Precisely, the following equality holds\n\n See also \n\n Geometric measure theory\n Divergence theorem\n Pfeffer integral\n\n Notes \n\nReferences\n\nHistorical references\n.

    "text": "Canillo () is one of the parishes of Andorra. Canillo is also the name of the main town of the parish. The parish is considered the religious center of Andorra with the Sanctuary and Chapel of Our Lady of Meritxell, patron saint of Andorra, and contains one of the most well preserved romanesque church in the Pyrenees, Sant Joan de Caselles. It has a population of 4,826, as of 2011. Despite having a tourist vocation, the parish of Canillo still retains many livestock and agricultural traits.\n\nGeography\nThe localities of Canillo parish include Soldeu, Bordes d'Envalira, El Tarter, Sant Pere, Ransol, Els Plans, El Vilar, l'Armiana, l'Aldosa, El Forn, Incles, Prats, Meritxell and Molleres. Unlike the rest of Andorra, Canillo is divided by veïnats (neighborhoods). Canillo Parish is Andorra's largest parish, at 121 square kilometers (47 sq mi).\n\nLarge natural places and areas in the parish include the Incles Valley, the Ransol Valley and the Montaup Valley. On the hiking trail of the Incles Valley is located the Estany de Juclà, the largest lake in Andorra, with 21.3 hectares (0.21 km²).http://visitandorra.com/es/naturaleza/ruta-de-senderismo-estany-de-jucla/\n\nHistory\nthumb|left|The 12th-century Romanesque church of Sant Joan de Caselles.\nthumb|left|Montaup River in Canillo with the church of Sant Serni at background.\nThe etymological origin of the name of the parish Ordino and its capital is pre-Roman, Iberian or Celtic. It is documented for the first time in the Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell), during the 9th century, as Kanillave or Sant Serni de Kanillave. Later on it was referred to as Canilau as it appears in a document from 1176.http://www.elcami.cat/pobles/canillo\n\nIn Prats is located the sanctuary of Roc de les Bruixes, a set of rock-engraved ritual themes dating from the Bronze Age and the Iberian era, to the Early Middle Ages. Originally it was a sacred place from where the Iberians extracted stone powder to make ointments.https://forum.ad/el-roc-de-les-bruixes-era-un-lloc-sagrat-don-els-ibers-extreien-pols-de-pedra-per-fer-unguents/ Late Gothic remains such as the necropolis of Sant Joan de Caselles or the one aside Sant Serni de Canillo in the late 7th and 8th century provide proof of the early Christianity in Andorra.https://www.bondia.ad/cultura/troballes-que-aporten-mes-llum-la-historia-de-canillohttp://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/65707/1/TFG%20Marina%20Camp%C3%A0s.pdf\n\nThe parish maintains its traditional character from the Medieval Period including old mills and traditional mountain houses. Such as the flour mill of the Peano, a sample of the old sources of wealth of the country, and the buildings that can be found in the old quarter of the capital, such as Ca Armany, Cal Fluix or Cal Ferrer Nou, as well as the old quarter of Soldeu or Incles.http://www.elcami.cat/camipedia/patrimoni-arquitectonic-de-canillo\n\nThe church of Sant Joan de Caselles, Romanesque building from the end of the 11th century, is perhaps one of the most emblematic churches of the Principality. Inside the temple there is a Romanesque stucco Majesty on a mural painting (12th century) and a Gothic altarpiece from the 16th century with German and Italian influences.http://www.cataloniasacra.cat/llocs/esglesia-de-sant-joan-de-caselles/602/l_ca The other churches in Canillo include the parish church of Sant Serni located in the old town of Canillo, original from the 12th century with the structure and interior elements of Baroque style (17th-18th centuries), the church of Sant Miquel de Prats (12th-13th centuries) and the church of Santa Creu de Canillo (1781) located in Canillo at the river bank of the Valira river.https://www.diariandorra.ad/noticies/cultura/2009/11/18/una_tomba_llosa_confirmaria_39_origen_medieval_sant_serni_canillo_24905_1127.html\n\nCulture and folklore\nThe town figures into the Andorran legend El buner d'Ordino, in which a bagpiper from the parish of Ordino, en route to a festival in Canillo, is chased and treed by wolves, but frightens them off by playing his instrument.\n\nThe parish is intimately related to the national legend of Charlemagne. The legend explains that Charlemagne entered through the Valleys from Incles, and made a ring on the mountain of Pic Negre of Juclà to tie his horse, marking the borders between Andorra and Sabartés (Ariège), which It was in the Carolingian era Sabart, a small town today annexed to Tarascon. Not far from the place it's found the Creu Gótica de Carlemany (Gothic Cross of Charlemagne), a tribute to the blacksmiths of the country.https://www.elcami.cat/camipedia/patrimoni-arquitectonic-de-canillohttp://www.andorraantiga.com/llegendes-del-pais-del-pirineus.-andorra..html\n\nthumb|right|Sculpture to Carlemany located in Canillo's town.\nthumb|right|Santuari Nou de Meritxell, the New Sanctuary inaugurated in 1976.\n\nAlso the Creu dels Set Braços (Cross of the seven arms) can be found in the parish. The cross is the origin of the tragic legend about a boy from Prats who thought that the devil could go find him someday. He accidentally killed one of his friends who wanted to scare him to make him a joke after returning from the town of Canillo to bring a barrel of wine. The body disappeared mysteriously, some say by the devil himself. In the place where the accident happened, they placed a cross in order that the passers remember and removed the consequence of such ugly act. The cross had seven arms, like seven were the young people who wanted to make fun of their compatriot. One of them disappeared, and, strangely coinciding, the cross also lost one of his arms.http://visitandorra.com/ca/cultura/creu-dels-7-bracos/\n\nCanillo is the place of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Meritxell. According to legend, a shepherd found the image of the Virgin on a winter day under some flowering roses and decided to take it home. The image, however, returned three times to the same place where it had been found. Finally, the Andorrans decided to build a chapel there.https://www.elcami.cat/camipedia/llegendes-del-santuari-de-nostra-senyora-de-meritxell In 1873, the General Council of the Valleys declared her the patron saint of the country and on 8 September 1921 it was declared the National Holiday of the Principality.https://www.elperiodic.ad/opinio/article/37213/100-anys-de-patronatge-de-la-verge-de-meritxell\n\nThe original sanctuary was of Romanesque style and was completely restored in the 17th century. In 1972, the sanctuary burned down, being completely destroyed along with the Romanesque statue of the Virgin. The construction of a new sanctuary was entrusted to the Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill Levi. The new building was inaugurated in 1976. Inside it is still revered a replica of the Romanesque carving statue of the Virgin that was destroyed in the fire.https://www.plataformaarquitectura.cl/cl/02-261690/clasicos-de-arquitectura-santuario-de-meritxell-ricardo-bofill\n\nThe sanctuary was declared a Minor basilica on 13 May 2014 by Pope Francishttp://opusdei.org/ca-es/article/el-papa-francesc-concedeix-al-santuari-de-meritxell-el-titol-de-basilica/ and joined the Marian Route (Ruta Mariana), a cultural-religious nature route, together with Our Lady of the Pillar, Our Lady of Torreciudad, Our Lady of Montserrat and Our Lady of Lourdes.https://rutamariana.com/la-ruta-mariana/\n\nEvents and festivities\nOne of the earliest celebrations in Canillo during January is Sant Antoni, in which the traditional markets are celebrated and vianda is distributed, which is a mountain soup. The crema del mai (burning of mai) is celebrated to left behind the hard winter: traditionally a spruce fir tree was burned and people in town sang and danced around it until the flames consumed it. The tree is still burning up nowadays, one of those used as a decoration on the public road during Christmas, and theater groups encourage the party for the little ones.https://www.elcami.cat/camipedia/calendari-de-festes-de-canillohttps://www.elperiodic.ad/opinio/article/28716/a-la-crema-del-mai\n\nAnother very deeply rooted festival is the Carnival, also known as the Harlequin Festival where the typical costume is that of harlequin, which is made out of clothes and scrolls (bells) and appears after the hanging of the king Carnival or rei Carnestoltes.http://www.festes.org/arxius/arlequinspoliciacarnaval.pdf\n\nAlready in the middle of the summer, the Canillo Festival is celebrated and began the Sheepdog Contest at the Planells de Mereig, organized by the local government and the Association of the Canillo Sheepdog Contest, as part of the Championship of the Catalan Countries.http://visitandorra.com/ca/agenda/concurs-de-gossos-d-atura/\n\nSports\nSoldeu-El Tarter hosted World Cup alpine events for the first time in February 2012;https://www.nevasport.com/noticias/art/33867/Rossignol-Soldeu-2012-World-Cup/ and then in February 2016 a super-G and a combined.https://www.grandvalira.com/en/news/fis-world-cup-grandvalira-soldeu-el-tarter-2016-show-organisation-and-party The World Cup finals (eight events) are scheduled for Soldeu in March 2019.https://www.longines.com/magazine/white-season-2019/chapter-03\n\nDuring the summer, mountain activities such as railroads, hiking and climbing routes are organized in the parish, as well as bike and cycling routes in Grand Valira and Vall d'Incles.

    "title": "Counter machine",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_machine",
    "text": "A counter machine is an abstract machine used in formal logic and theoretical computer science to model computation. It is the most primitive of the four types of register machines. A counter machine comprises a set of one or more unbounded registers, each of which can hold a single non-negative integer, and a list of (usually sequential) arithmetic and control instructions for the machine to follow. The counter machine is typically used in the process of designing parallel algorithms in relation to the mutual exclusion principle. When used in this manner, the counter machine is used to model the discrete time-steps of a computational system in relation to memory accesses. By modeling computations in relation to the memory accesses for each respective computational step, parallel algorithms may be designed in such a matter to avoid interlocking, the simultaneous writing operation by two (or more) threads to the same memory address.\n\n Basic features \n\nFor a given counter machine model the instruction set is tiny—from just one to six or seven instructions. Most models contain a few arithmetic operations and at least one conditional operation (if condition is true, then jump). Three base models, each using three instructions, are drawn from the following collection. (The abbreviations are arbitrary.)\n CLR (r): CLeaR register r. (Set r to zero.)\n INC (r): INCrement the contents of register r.\n DEC (r): DECrement the contents of register r.\n CPY (rj, rk): CoPY the contents of register rj to register rk leaving the contents of rj intact.\n JZ (r, z): IF register r contains Zero THEN Jump to instruction z ELSE continue in sequence.\n JE (rj, rk, z): IF the contents of register rj Equals the contents of register rk THEN Jump to instruction z ELSE continue in sequence.\n\nIn addition, a machine usually has a HALT instruction, which stops the machine (normally after the result has been computed).\n\nUsing the instructions mentioned above, various authors have discussed certain counter machines:\n set 1: { INC (r), DEC (r), JZ (r, z) }, (Minsky (1961, 1967), Lambek (1961))\n set 2: { CLR (r), INC (r), JE (rj, rk, z) }, (Ershov (1958), Peter (1958) as interpreted by Shepherdson-Sturgis (1964); Minsky (1967); Schönhage (1980))\n set 3: { INC (r), CPY (rj, rk), JE (rj, rk, z) }, (Elgot-Robinson (1964), Minsky (1967))\n\nThe three counter machine base models have the same computational power since the instructions of one model can be derived from those of another. All are equivalent to the computational power of Turing machines. Due to their unary processing style, counter machines are typically exponentially slower than comparable Turing machines.\n\n Alternative names, alternative models \n\nThe counter machine models go by a number of different names that may help to distinguish them by their peculiarities. In the following the instruction \"JZDEC ( r )\" is a compound instruction that tests to see if a register r is empty; if so then jump to instruction Iz, else if not then DECrement the contents of r:\n\n Shepherdson-Sturgis machine, because these authors formally stated their model in an easily accessible exposition (1963). Uses instruction set (1) augmented with additional convenience instructions (JNZ is \"Jump if Not Zero, used in place of JZ):\n { INC ( r ), DEC ( r ), CLR ( r ), CPY ( rj, rk ), JNZ ( r, z ), J ( z ) }\n Minsky machine, because Marvin Minsky (1961) formalized the model. Usually uses instruction set (1), but instruction-execution is not default-sequential so the additional parameter 'z' appears to specify the next instruction after INC and as the alternative in JZDEC:\n { INC ( r, z ), JZDEC ( r, ztrue, zfalse) }\n Program machine, Program computer, the names Minsky (1967) gave the model because, like a computer its instructions proceed sequentially unless a conditional jump is successful. Uses (usually) instruction set (1) but may be augmented similar to the Shepherson-Sturgis model. JZDEC is often split apart:\n {  INC ( r ), DEC ( r ), JZ ( r, ztrue )}\n Abacus machine, the name Lambek (1961) gave to his simplification of the Melzak (1961) model, and what Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) calls it. Uses instruction set (1) but with an additional parameter z to specify the next instruction in the manner of the Minsky (1961) model;\n { INC ( r, z ), JZDEC (r, ztrue, zfalse ) }\n Lambek machine, an alternative name Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) gave to the abacus machine. Uses instruction set (1-reduced) with an additional parameter to specify the next instruction:\n { INC ( r, z ), JZDEC ( r, ztrue, zfalse ) }\n Successor machine, because it uses the 'successor operation' of, and closely resembles, the Peano axioms. Used as a base for the successor RAM model. Uses instruction set (2) by e.g. Schönhage as a base for his RAM0 and RAM1 models that lead to his pointer machine SMM model, also discussed briefly in van Emde Boas (1990):\n { CLR ( r ), INC ( r ), JE ( rj, rk, z ) }\n Elgot-Robinson model, used to define their RASP model (1964). This model requires one empty register at the start (e.g. [r0] =0). (They augmented the same model with indirect addressing by use of an additional register to be used as an \"index\" register.)\n { INC (r), CPY ( rs, rd ), JE ( rj, rk, z ) }\n Other counter machines: Minsky (1967) demonstrates how to build the three base models (program/Minsky/Lambek-abacus, successor, and Elgot-Robinson) from the superset of available instructions described in the lead paragraph of this article. The Melzak (1961) model is quite different from the above because it includes 'add' and 'subtract' rather than 'increment' and 'decrement'. The proofs of Minsky (1961, 1967) that a single register will suffice for Turing equivalence requires the two instructions { MULtiply k, and DIV k } to encode and decode the Gödel number in the register that represents the computation. Minsky shows that if two or more registers are available then the simpler INC, DEC etc. are adequate (but the Gödel number is still required to demonstrate Turing equivalence; also demonstrated in Elgot-Robinson 1964).\n\n Formal definition \nA counter machine consists of:\n Labeled unbounded integer-valued registers: a finite (or infinite in some models) set of registers r0 ... rn each of which can hold any single non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ... - i.e. unbounded). The registers do their own arithmetic; there may or may not be one or more special registers e.g. \"accumulator\" (See Random-access machine for more on this).\n A state register that stores/identifies the current instruction to be executed. This register is finite and separate from the registers above; thus the counter machine model is an example of the Harvard architecture\n List of labelled, sequential instructions: A finite list of instructions I0 ... Im. The program store (instructions of the finite state machine) is not in the same physical \"space\" as the registers. Usually, but not always, like computer programs the instructions are listed in sequential order; unless a jump is successful, the default sequence continues in numerical order. Each of the instructions in the list is from a (very) small set, but this set does not include indirection. Historically most models drew their instructions from this set:\n { Increment (r), Decrement (r), Clear (r); Copy (rj,rk), conditional Jump if contents of r=0, conditional Jump if rj=rk, unconditional Jump, HALT }\n\n Some models have either further atomized some of the above into no-parameter instructions, or combined them into a single instruction such as \"Decrement\" preceded by conditional jump-if-zero \"JZ ( r, z )\" . The atomization of instructions or the inclusion of convenience instructions causes no change in conceptual power, as any program in one variant can be straightforwardly translated to the other.\n\n Alternative instruction-sets are discussed in the supplement Register-machine models.\n\n Example: COPY the count from register #2 to #3 \nThis example shows how to create three more useful instructions: clear, unconditional jump, and copy.\n CLR ( j ): Clear the contents of register rj to zero.\n J ( z ): Unconditionally jump to instruction Iz.\n CPY ( s, d ): Copy the contents of source register rs to destination register rd. Afterward rs will contain its original count (unlike MOVE which empties the source register, i.e., clears it to zero).\n\nThe basic set (1) is used as defined here:\n Instruction Effect on register \"j\" Effect on  Instruction Counter Register ICR Summary INC ( j ) [j] +1 → j [IC] +1 → IC Increment contents of register j; next instruction DEC ( j ) [j]  -1 → j [IC] +1 → IC Decrement contents of register j; next instruction JZ ( j, z)  IF [j] = 0 THEN Iz → IC ELSE [IC] +1 → IC If contents of register j=0 then instruction z else next instruction HALT   \n\n Initial conditions \n\nInitially, register #2 contains \"2\". Registers #0, #1 and #3 are empty (contain \"0\"). Register #0 remains unchanged throughout calculations because it is used for the unconditional jump. Register #1 is a scratch pad. The program begins with instruction 1.\n\n Final conditions \n\nThe program HALTs with the contents of register #2 at its original count and the contents of register #3 equal to the original contents of register #2, i.e.,\n [2] = [3].\n\n Program high-level description \n\nThe program COPY ( #2, #3) has two parts. In the first part the program moves the contents of source register #2 to both scratch-pad #1 and to destination register #3; thus #1 and #3 will be copies of one another and of the original count in #2, but #2 is cleared in the process of decrementing it to zero. Unconditional jumps J (z) are done by tests of register #0, which always contains the number 0:\n [#2] →#3; [#2] →#1; 0 →#2\n\nIn the second the part the program moves (returns, restores) the contents of scratch-pad #1 back to #2, clearing the scratch-pad #1 in the process:\n [#1] →#2; 0 →#1\n\n Program \nThe program, highlighted in yellow, is shown written left-to-right in the upper right.\n\nA \"run\" of the program is shown below. Time runs down the page. The instructions are in yellow, the registers in blue. The program is flipped 90 degrees, with the instruction numbers (addresses) along the top, the instruction mnemonics under the addresses, and the instruction parameters under the mnemonics (one per cell):\n                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ← Instruction number (address)               JZ DEC INC INC JZ JZ DEC INC JZ H ← Instruction                2 2 3 1 0 1 1 2 0  ← Register number                6    1 10   6  ← Jump-to instruction number step IC Inst # reg # J-addr  reg0 reg1 reg2 reg3 reg4  IC             start       0 0 2 0 0  1            move [#2] to #1 and #3: 1  1 JZ 2 6  0 0 2 0 0  1→2  JZ          Jump fails: register #2 contains 2 2  2 DEC 2 0  0 0 2→1 0 0  2→3   DEC         Decrement register #2 from 2 to 1 3  3 INC 3 0  0 0 1 0→1 0  3→4    INC        Increment register #3 from 0 to 1 4  4 INC 1 0  0 0→1 1 1 0  4→5     INC       Increment register #1 from 0 to 1 5  5 JZ 0 1  0 1 1 1 0  5→1      JZ      U-Jump: register #0 is empty 6  1 JZ 2 6  0 1 1 1 0  1→2  JZ          Jump fails: register #2 contains 1 7  2 DEC 2 0  0 1 1→0 1 0  2→3   DEC         Decrement register #2 from 1 to 0 8  3 INC 3 0  0 1 0 1→2 0  3→4    INC        Increment register #3 from 1 to 2 9  4 INC 1 0  0 1→2 0 2 0  4→5     INC       Increment register #1 from 1 to 2 10  5 JZ 0 1  0 2 0 2 0  5→1      JZ      U-Jump: register #0 is empty 11  1 JZ 2 6  0 2 0 2 0  1→6  JZ          Jump !: register #2 is empty                          move [1] to 2: 12  6 JZ 1 10  0 2 0 2 0  6→7       JZ     Jump fails: register #1 contains 2 13  7 DEC 1 0  0 2→1 0 2 0  7→8        DEC    Decrement register #1 from 2 to 1 14  8 INC 2 0  0 1 0→1 2 0  8→9         INC   Increment register #2 from 0 to 1 15  9 JZ 0 6  0 1 1 2 0  9→6          JZ  U-Jump: register #0 is empty 16  6 JZ 1 10  0 1 1 2 0  6→7       JZ     Jump fails: register #1 contains 1 17  7 DEC 1 0  0 1→0 1 2 0  7→8        DEC    Decrement register #1 from 1 to 0 18  8 INC 2 0  0 0 1→2 2 0  8→9         INC   Increment register #2 from 1 to 2 19  9 JZ 0 6  0 0 2 2 0  9→6          JZ  U-Jump: register #0 is empty 20  6 JZ 1 10  0 0 2 2 0  6→10       JZ     Jump !: register #1 is empty 21  10 H 0 0  0 0 2 2 0  10→10           H HALT\n\nThe partial recursive functions: building \"convenience instructions\" using recursion\nThe example above demonstrates how the first basic instructions { INC, DEC, JZ } can create three more instructions—unconditional jump J, CLR, CPY. In a sense CPY used both CLR and J plus the base set. If register #3 had had contents initially, the sum of contents of #2 and #3 would have ended up in #3. So to be fully accurate CPY program should have preceded its moves with CLR (1) and CLR (2).\n\nHowever, we do see that ADD would have been possible, easily. And in fact the following is summary of how the primitive recursive functions such as ADD, MULtiply and EXPonent can come about (see Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) p. 45-51).\n\n Beginning instruction set: { DEC, INC, JZ, H }\n Define unconditional \"Jump J (z)\" in terms of JZ ( r0, z ) given that r0 contains 0.\n { J, DEC, INC, JZ, H }\n Define \"CLeaR ( r ) in terms of the above:\n { CLR, J, DEC, INC, JZ, H }\n Define \"CoPY ( rj, rk )\" while preserving contents of rj in terms of the above:\n { CPY, CLR, J, DEC, INC, JZ, H }\n The above is the instruction set of Shepherdson-Sturgis (1963).\n\n Define \"ADD ( rj, rk, ri )\",  (perhaps preserving the contents of rj, and rk ), by use of the above:\n { ADD, CPY, CLR, J, DEC, INC, JZ, H }\n Define \" MULtiply ( rj, rk, ri )\" (MUL) (perhaps preserving the contents of rj, rk), in terms of the above:\n { MUL, ADD, CPY, CLR, J, DEC, INC, JZ, H }\n Define \"EXPonential ( rj, rk, ri )\" (EXP) (perhaps preserving the contents of rj, rk ) in terms of the above,\n { EXP, MUL, ADD, CPY, CLR, J, DEC, INC, JZ, H }\n\nIn general, we can build any partial- or total- primitive recursive function that we wish, by using the same methods. Indeed, Minsky (1967), Shepherdson-Sturgis (1963) and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) give demonstrations of how to form the five primitive recursive function \"operators\" (1-5 below) from the base set (1).\n\nBut what about full Turing equivalence? We need to add the sixth operator—the μ operator—to obtain the full equivalence, capable of creating the total- and partial- recursive functions:\n Zero function (or constant function)\n Successor function\n Identity function\n Composition function\n Primitive recursion (induction)\n μ operator (unbounded search operator)\n\nThe authors show that this is done easily within any of the available base sets (1, 2, or 3) (an example can be found at μ operator ). However, the reader needs to be cautioned that, even though the μ operator is easily created by the base instruction set doesn't mean that an arbitrary partial recursive function can be easily created with a base model -- Turing equivalence and partial recursive functions imply an unbounded μ operator, one that can scurry to the ends of the register chain ad infinitum searching for its goal. The problem is: registers must be called out explicily by number/name e.g. INC (47,528) and DEC (39,347) and this will exhaust the finite state machine's TABLE of instructions. No matter how \"big\" the finite state machine is, we can find a function that uses a \"bigger\" number of registers.\n\n Problems with the counter machine model \n The problems are discussed in detail in the article Random-access machine. The problems fall into two major classes and a third \"inconvenience\" class:\n\n(1) Unbounded capacities of registers versus bounded capacities of state-machine instructions: How will the machine create constants larger than the capacity of its finite state machine?\n\n(2) Unbounded numbers of registers versus bounded numbers of state-machine instructions: How will the machine access registers with address-numbers beyond the reach/capability of its finite state machine?\n\n(3) The fully reduced models are cumbersome:\n\nShepherdson and Sturgis (1963) are unapologetic about their 6-instruction set. They have made their choice based on \"ease of programming... rather than economy\" (p. 219 footnote 1).\n\nShepherdson and Sturgis' instructions ( [r] indicates \"contents of register r\"):\n INCREMENT ( r ) ; [r] +1 → r\n DECREMENT ( r ) ; [r] -1 → r\n CLEAR ( r ) ; 0 → r\n COPY ( rs to rd ) ; [rs] → rd\n JUMP-UNCONDITIONAL to instruction Iz\n JUMP IF [r] =0 to instruction Iz\n\nMinsky (1967) expanded his 2-instruction set { INC (z), JZDEC (r, Iz) } to { CLR (r), INC (r), JZDEC (r, Iz), J (Iz) } before his proof that a \"Universal Program Machine\" can be built with only two registers (p. 255ff).\n\nTwo-counter machines are Turing equivalent (with a caveat)\n\nFor every Turing machine, there is a 2CM that simulates it, given that the 2CM's input and output are properly encoded. This is proved in Minsky's book (Computation, 1967, p. 255-258), and an alternative proof is sketched below in three steps. First, a Turing machine can be simulated by a finite-state machine (FSM) equipped with two stacks. Then, two stacks can be simulated by four counters. Finally, four counters can be simulated by two counters.\nThe two counters machine use the set of instruction { INC ( r, z ), JZDEC ( r, ztrue, zfalse) }.\n\nStep 1: A Turing machine can be simulated by two stacks.\nA Turing machine consists of an FSM and an infinite tape, initially filled with zeros, upon which the machine can write ones and zeros. At any time, the read/write head of the machine points to one cell on the tape. This tape can be conceptually cut in half at that point. Each half of the tape can be treated as a stack, where the top is the cell nearest the read/write head, and the bottom is some distance away from the head, with all zeros on the tape beyond the bottom. Accordingly, a Turing machine can be simulated by an FSM plus two stacks. Moving the head left or right is equivalent to popping a bit from one stack and pushing it onto the other. Writing is equivalent to changing the bit before pushing it.\n\nStep 2: A stack can be simulated by two counters.\nA stack containing zeros and ones can be simulated by two counters when the bits on the stack are thought of as representing a binary number (the topmost bit on the stack being the least significant bit). Pushing a zero onto the stack is equivalent to doubling the number. Pushing a one is equivalent to doubling and adding 1. Popping is equivalent to dividing by 2, where the remainder is the bit that was popped. Two counters can simulate this stack, in which one of the counters holds a number whose binary representation represents the bits on the stack, and the other counter is used as a scratchpad. To double the number in the first counter, the FSM can initialize the second counter to zero, then repeatedly decrement the first counter once and increment the second counter twice. This continues until the first counter reaches zero. At that point, the second counter will hold the doubled number. Halving is performed by decrementing one counter twice and increment the other once, and repeating until the first counter reaches zero. The remainder can be determined by whether it reached zero after an even or an odd number of steps, where the parity of the number of steps is encoded in the state of the FSM.\n\nStep 3: Four counters can be simulated by two counters.\nAs before, one of the counters is used as scratchpad. The other holds an integer whose prime factorization is 2a3b5c7d. The exponents a, b, c, and d can be thought of as four virtual counters that are being packed (via Gödel numbering) into a single real counter. If the real counter is set to zero then incremented once, that is equivalent to setting all the virtual counters to zero. If the real counter is doubled, that is equivalent to incrementing a, and if it's halved, that's equivalent to decrementing a. By a similar procedure, it can be multiplied or divided by 3, which is equivalent to incrementing or decrementing b. Similarly, c and d can be incremented or decremented. To check if a virtual counter such as c is equal to zero, just divide the real counter by 5, see what the remainder is, then multiply by 5 and add back the remainder. That leaves the real counter unchanged. The remainder will have been nonzero if and only if c was zero.\n\nAs a result, an FSM with two counters can simulate four counters, which are in turn simulating two stacks, which are simulating a Turing machine. Therefore, an FSM plus two counters is at least as powerful as a Turing machine. A Turing machine can easily simulate an FSM with two counters, therefore the two machines have equivalent power.\n\n The caveat: *If* its counters are initialised to N and 0, then a 2CM cannot calculate 2N \n\nThis result, together with a list of other functions of N that are not calculable by a two-counter machine — when initialised with N in one counter and 0 in the other — such as N2, sqrt(N), log2(N), etc., appears in a paper by Schroeppel (1972). The result is not surprising, because the two-counter machine model was proved (by Minsky) to be universal only when the argument N is appropriately encoded (by Gödelization) to simulate a Turing machine whose initial tape contains N encoded in unary; moreover, the output of the two-counter machine will be similarly encoded. This phenomenon is typical of very small bases of computation whose universality is proved only by simulation (e.g., many Turing tarpits, the smallest-known universal Turing machines, etc.).\n\nThe proof is preceded by some interesting theorems:\n\n \"Theorem: A three-counter machine can simulate a Turing machine\" (p. 2, also cf Minsky 1967:170-174)\n \"Theorem: A 3CM [three-counter machine] can compute any partial recursive function of one variable. It starts with the argument [i.e. N] in a counter, and (if it halts) leaves the answer [i.e. F(N)] in a counter.\" (p. 3)\n \"Theorem: A counter machine can be simulated by a 2CM [two-counter machine], provided an obscure coding is accepted for the input and output\" [p. 3; the \"obscure coding\" is: 2W3X5Y7Z where the simulated counters are W, X, Y, Z]\n \"Theorem: Any counter machine can be simulated by a 2CM, provided an obscure coding is accepted for the input and output.\" (p. 3)\n \"Corollary: the halting problem for 2CMs is unsolvable.\n \"Corollary: A 2CM can compute any partial recursive function of one argument, provided the input is coded as 2N and the output (if the machine halts) is coded as 2answer.\" (p. 3)\n \"Theorem: There is no two counter machine that calculates 2N [if one counter is initialised to N].\" (p. 11)\n\nWith regard to the second theorem that \"A 3CM can compute any partial recursive function\" the author challenges the reader with a \"Hard Problem: Multiply two numbers using only three counters\" (p. 2). The main proof involves the notion that two-counter machines cannot compute arithmetic sequences with non-linear growth rates (p. 15) i.e. \"the function 2X grows more rapidly than any arithmetic progression.\" (p. 11).\n\nA practical example of calculation by counting\n\nThe Friden EC-130 calculator had no adder logic as such. Its logic was highly serial, doing arithmetic by counting. Internally, decimal digits were radix-1 — for instance, a six was represented by six consecutive pulses within the time slot allocated for that digit. Each time slot carried one digit, least significant first. Carries set a flip-flop which caused one count to be added to the digit in the next time slot.\n\nAdding was done by an up-counter, while subtracting was done by a down-counter, with a similar scheme for dealing with borrows.\n\nThe time slot scheme defined six registers of 13 decimal digits, each with a sign bit.\nMultiplication and division were by done basically by repeated addition and subtraction. The square root version, the EC-132, effectively subtracted consecutive odd integers, each decrement requiring two consecutive subtractions. After the first, the minuend was incremented by one before the second subtraction.\n\nSee also\n Counter machine:Reference model\n Pointer machine\n Post–Turing machine\n Register machine\n Wang B-machine\n\nReferences\n\n George Boolos, John P.

    "text": "Cuneo (;  ;  ) is a city and comune in Piedmont, Northern Italy, the capital of the province of Cuneo, the third largest of Italy’s provinces by area.\n\nIt is located at 550 metres (1,804 ft) in the south-west of Piedmont, at the confluence of the rivers Stura and Gesso.\n\nCuneo is bounded by the municipalities of Beinette, Borgo San Dalmazzo, Boves, Busca, Caraglio, Castelletto Stura, Centallo, Cervasca, Morozzo, Peveragno, Tarantasca and Vignolo.\n\nIt is located near six mountain passes:\nColle della Maddalena at \nColle di Tenda at  - Tunnel of Tenda at ,  long\nColle del Melogno at  \nColle San Bernardo at  \nColle di Nava at \nColle di Cadibona at .\n\nHistory\nCuneo was founded in 1198 by the local population, who declared it an independent commune, freeing themselves from the authority of the bishops of Asti and the marquisses of Montferrat and Saluzzo. In 1210 the latter occupied it, and in 1231 the Cuneesi rebelled. In 1238 they were recognized as free commune by Emperor Frederick II.\n\nIn 1259 the independence of Cuneo ceased forever, as it gave itself, also to take protection against its more powerful neighbours, to Charles I of Anjou, who was then King of Naples and Count of Provence. Together with Alba, it was the main Angevine possession in Northern Italy; their rule (in fact interrupted by periods under Saluzzo, Savoy, the Visconti of Milan) ended in 1382 when Cuneo was acquired by the Duchy of Savoy.\n\nCuneo became an important stronghold of the expanding Savoy state, and was thus besieged by France several times: first in 1515 by Swiss troops of Francis I of France, then again in 1542, 1557, 1639, 1641, 1691 and, during the War of Austrian Succession, in 1741. In all the sieges Cuneo resisted successfully. Cuneo was conquered by France only during the Napoleonic Wars, when it was made the capital of the Stura department. After the restoration of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the unification of Italy, Cuneo became the capital of its namesake province in 1859.\n\nDuring World War II, from 1943 to 1945, it was one of the main centres of partisan resistance against the German occupation of Italy . \nIn 1943, Cuneo's Jewish residents were briefly arrested and imprisoned at the nearby Borgo San Dalmazzo concentration camp by the order of Minister of the Interior Guido Buffarini Guidi. They were freed before the Minister's orders came into effect and most community members subsequently fled Cuneo into hiding. However, on December 9, 1944, the Cuneo Police Department reopened the camp and imprisoned the remaining Jewish residents of Cuneo, most of whom were then deported to Auschwitz with few survivors reported. Italian partisans liberated Cuneo from the German and Italian fascist occupation on April 25, 1945. Retreating forces murdered the six Jewish prisoners being held at Cuneo's local prison. https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/cuneoP.

    "text": "Distributed Proofreaders (commonly abbreviated as DP or PGDP) is a web-based project that supports the development of e-texts for Project Gutenberg by allowing many people to work together in proofreading drafts of e-texts for errors. By July 2015, over 30,000 texts had been digitized.\n\n History \n\nDistributed Proofreaders was founded by Charles Franks in 2000 as an independent site to assist Project Gutenberg. Distributed Proofreaders became an official Project Gutenberg site in 2002.\n\nOn 8 November 2002, Distributed Proofreaders was slashdotted, and more than 4,000 new members joined in one day, causing an influx of new proofreaders and software developers, which helped to greatly increase the quantity and quality of e-text production. Distributed Proofreaders posted their 5,000th text to Project Gutenberg in October 2004, in March 2007, the 10,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg, in May 2009, the 15,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg, in April 2011, the 20,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg, and in July 2015, the 30,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg. DP-contributed e-texts comprised more than half of works in Project Gutenberg, .\n\nOn 31 July 2006, the Distributed Proofreaders Foundation was formed to provide Distributed Proofreaders with its own legal entity and not-for-profit status. IRS approval of section 501(c)(3) status was granted retroactive to 7 April 2006.\n\n Proofreading process \n\nPublic domain works, typically books with expired copyright, are scanned by volunteers or sourced from digitization projects and the images are run through optical character recognition (OCR) software. Since OCR software is far from perfect, a large number of errors often appear in the resulting text. To correct them, pages are made available to volunteers via the Internet; the original page image and the recognized text appear side by side. This process thereby distributes the time-consuming error-correction process, akin to distributed computing.\n\nEach page is proofread and formatted several times, and then a post-processor combines the pages and prepares the text for uploading to Project Gutenberg.\n\nBesides custom software created to support the project, DP also runs a forum and a wiki for project coordinators and participants.\n\n Related projects \n\n DP Europe \nIn January 2004, Distributed Proofreaders Europe started, hosted by Project Rastko, Serbia. This site had the ability to process text in Unicode UTF-8 encoding. Books proofread centered mainly on European culture, with a large proportion of non-English texts including Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu and many others. , DP Europe had produced 787 e-texts, the last of these in November 2011.\n\nThe original DP is sometimes referred to as \"DP International\" by members of DP Europe. However, DP servers are located in the United States, and therefore works must be cleared by Project Gutenberg as being in the public domain according to U.S. copyright law before they can be proofread and eventually published at DP.\n\n DP Canada \nIn December 2007, Distributed Proofreaders Canada launched to support the production of e-books for Project Gutenberg Canada and take advantage of shorter Canadian copyright terms. Although it was established by members of the original Distributed Proofreaders site, it is a separate entity. All of its projects are posted to Faded Page, their book archive website. In addition, it supplies books to Project Gutenberg Canada (which launched on Canada Day 2007) and (where copyright laws are compatible) to the original Project Gutenberg.\n\nIn addition to preserving Canadiana, DP Canada is notable because it is the first major effort to take advantage of Canada's copyright laws which may allow more works to be preserved. Unlike copyright law in some other countries, Canada has a \"life plus 50\" copyright term. This means that works by authors who died more than fifty years ago may be preserved in Canada, whereas in other parts of the world those works may not be distributed because they are still under copyright.\n\nNotable authors whose works may be preserved in Canada but not other parts of the world include Clark Ashton Smith, Dashiell Hammett, Ernest Hemingway, Carl Jung, A. A. Milne, Dorothy Sayers, Nevil Shute, Walter de la Mare, Sheila Kaye-Smith and Amy Carmichael.\n\n Milestones \n Milestone Date e-text Link to Project Gutenberg 1st 1 Oct 2000 The Odyssey, Homer, Lang tr.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_release_rate_%28fracture_mechanics%29",
    "text": "The energy release rate  is the rate at which energy is lost as a material undergoes fracture, which is an energy-per-unit-area. The energy release rate is mathematically understood as the decrement in total potential energy scaled by the increment in fracture surface area. Various energy balances can be constructed relating the energy released during fracture to the energy of the resulting new surface, as well as other dissipative processes such as plasticity and heat generation. The energy release rate is central to the field of fracture mechanics when solving problems and estimating material properties related to fracture and fatigue.\n\n Definition \n\nthumb|right|Plot of Load vs. Load-Displacement\n\nThe energy release rate  is defined  as the instantaneous loss of total potential energy  per unit crack growth area ,\n\n \n\nwhere the total potential energy is written in terms of the total strain energy , surface traction , displacement , and body force  by\n\n \n\nThe first integral is over the surface  of the material, and the second over its volume . \n\nThe figure on the right shows the plot of an external force  vs. the load-point displacement , in which the area under the curve is the strain energy. The white area between the curve and the -axis is referred to as the complementary energy. In the case of a linearly-elastic material,  is a straight line and the strain energy is equal to the complementary energy.\n\n Prescribed Displacement \nIn the case of prescribed displacement, the strain energy can be expressed in terms of the specified displacement and the crack surface , and the change in this strain energy is only affected by the change in fracture surface area: . Correspondingly, the energy release rate in this case is expressed as \n\n \n\nHere is where one can accurately refer to  as the strain energy release rate.\n\n Prescribed Loads \nWhen the load is prescribed instead of the displacement, the strain energy needs to be modified as . The energy release rate is then computed as \n\n \n\nIf the material is linearly-elastic, then  and one may instead write\n\n \n\n G in Two-Dimensional Cases\nIn the cases of two-dimensional problems, the change in crack growth area is simply the change in crack length times the thickness of the specimen. Namely, . Therefore, the equation for computing  can be modified for the 2D case: \n Prescribed Displacement: \n Prescribed Load: \n Prescribed Load, Linear Elastic: \nOne can refer to the example calculations embedded in the next section for further information. Sometimes the strain energy is written using , an energy-per-unit thickness. This gives\n Prescribed Displacement: \n Prescribed Load: \n Prescribed Load, Linear Elastic: \n\n Relation to Stress Intensity Factors \nThe energy release rate is directly related to the stress intensity factor associated with a given two-dimensional loading mode (Mode-I, Mode-II, or Mode-III) when the crack grows straight ahead. This is applicable to cracks under plane stress, plane strain, and antiplane shear. \n\nFor Mode-I, the energy release rate  rate is related to the Mode-I stress intensity factor  for a linearly-elastic material by\n\nwhere  is related to Young's modulus  and Poisson's ratio  depending on whether the material is under plane stress or plane strain:\n\nFor Mode-II, the energy release rate is similarly written as\n\nFor Mode-III (antiplane shear), the energy release rate now is a function of the shear modulus ,\n\nFor an arbitrary combination of all loading modes, these linear elastic solutions may be superposed as\n\n Relation to Fracture Toughness \n\nCrack growth is initiated when the energy release rate over comes a critical value , which is a material property,\n\nUnder Mode-I loading, the critical energy release rate  is then related to the Mode-I fracture toughness , another material property, by\n\n Calculating G \nThere are a variety of methods available for calculating the energy release rate given material properties, specimen geometry, and loading conditions. Some are dependent on certain criteria being satisfied, such as the material being entirely elastic or even linearly-elastic, and/or that the crack must grow straight ahead. The only method presented that works arbitrarily is that using the total potential energy. If two methods are both applicable, they should yield identical energy release rates.\n\n Total Potential Energy \n\nThe only method to calculate  for arbitrary conditions is to calculate the total potential energy and differentiate it with respect to the crack surface area. This is typically done by:\n calculating the stress field resulting from the loading,\n calculating the strain energy in the material resulting from the stress field,\n calculating the work done by the external loads,\nall in terms of the crack surface area. \n\nExample calculation of  using the total potential energy200px|right|thumb|Double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen under tensile load.\nThis problem is two-dimensional and has a fixed load, so with ,\n\nSince the material is linearly-elastic,  and thus\n\nThe stresses in the DCB are due to the bending stresses in each cantilever beam,\n\nwhere  is the length into the page. Using , one now has the strain energy\n\nwhere the factor of 2 out front is due to there being 2 cantilever beams. Solving,\n\nthen taking a derivative with respect to  and dividing by ,\n\n Compliance Method \nIf the material is linearly-elastic, the computation of its energy release rate can be much simplified. In this case, the Load vs. Load-point Displacement curve is linear with a positive slope, and the displacement per unit force applied is defined as the compliance,  \n \nThe corresponding strain energy  (area under the curve) is equal to \n \nUsing the compliance method, one can show that the energy release rate for both cases of prescribed load and displacement come out to be \n \n\nExample calculation of  using the compliance method 200px|right|thumb|A Double Cantilever Beam Specimen with Thickness B (not shown)\nConsider a double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen as shown in the right figure. The displacement of a single beam is\n\nThe resulting load-point displacement  is therefore . Substitute into the equation for compliance and simplify: \n\nNow,  is computed as\n \nFinally, the energy release rate of this DCB specimen can be expressed as\n \nNote that alternatively, the energy release rate can be expressed in terms of  and : \n \nindicating that  decreases with the crack length  for the case of fixed displacement, and vice versa for the case of fixed load. \n\n Multiple Specimen Methods for Nonlinear Materials \nthumb|right|Graphical Illustration of G under Fixed Displacement and Fixed Load Conditions\nIn the case of prescribed displacement, holding the crack length fixed, the energy release rate can be computed by \n\n \n\nwhile in the case of prescribed load,\n\n \nAs one can see that, in both cases, the energy release rate  times the change in surface  returns the area between curves, which indicates the energy dissipated for the new surface area as illustrated in the right figure \n \n\n Crack Closure Integral \nSince the energy release rate is defined as the negative derivative of the total potential energy with respect to crack surface growth, the energy release rate may be written as the difference between the potential energy before and after the crack grows. After some careful derivation, this leads one to the crack closure integral \n\nwhere  is the new fracture surface area,  are the components of the traction released on the top fracture surface as the crack grows,  are the components of the crack opening displacement (the difference in displacement increments between the top and bottom crack surfaces), and the integral is over the surface of the material .\n\nThe crack closure integral is valid only for elastic materials, but is still valid for cracks that grow in any direction. Nevertheless, for a two-dimensional crack that does indeed grow straight ahead, the crack closure integral simplifies to \n\nwhere  is the new crack length, and the displacement components are written as a function of the polar coordinates  and .\n\nExample calculation of  using the crack closure integral200px|right|thumb|Double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen under tensile load.\nConsider the crack in the DCB specimen shown in the figure. The nonzero stress and displacement components are given by  as\n\nThe crack closure integral for this linearly-elastic material, assuming the crack grows straight ahead, is\n\nConsider rescaling the integral using  for\n\nwhere one computes the simpler integral to be\n\nleaving the energy release rate as\n\nthe expected relation. In this case it is not straightforward to obtain  directly from the loading and geometry of the problem, but since the crack grows straight ahead and the material is linearly-elastic, the energy release rate here should be the same as the energy release rate calculated using the other methods. This allows one to indirectly retrieve the stress intensity factor for this problem as\n\n J-Integral \n\nIn certain situations, the energy release rate  can be calculated using the \nJ-integral, i.e. , using \n\nwhere  is the elastic strain energy density, is the component of the unit vector normal to , the curve used for the line integral, are the components of the traction vector , where  is the stress tensor, and are the components of the displacement vector. \n\nThis integral is zero over a simple closed path and is path independent, allowing any simple path starting and ending on the crack faces to be used to calculate .\nIn order to equate the energy release rate to the J-Integral, , the following conditions must be met: \n\n the crack must be growing straight ahead, and\n the deformation near the crack (enclosed by ) must be elastic (not plastic).\n\nThe J-integral may be calculated with these conditions violated, but then . When they are not violated, one can then relate the energy release rate and the J-integral to the elastic moduli and the stress intensity factors using \n\nExample calculation of  using the J-Integral 200px|right|thumb|Double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen under tensile load.\nthumb|J-integral path for the DCB specimen under tensile load.\nConsider the double cantilever beam specimen shown in the figure, where the crack centered in the beam of height  has a length of , and a load  is applied to open the crack. Assume that the material is linearly-elastic and that the crack grows straight forward. Consider a rectangular path shown in the second figure: start on the top crack face, (1) go up to the top at , (2) go to the right past the crack tip, (3) go down to the bottom at , (4) go along the bottom to the left, and (5) go back up to the bottom crack face. The J-Integral is zero along many parts of this path. The material is effectively unloaded behind the crack, so both the strain energy density and traction are zero along (1) and (2), and hence the J-Integral. Along (2) and (4) one has  as well as  (no traction on the free surface), so the J-Integral is zero on (2) and (4) as well. This leaves only (3); assuming one is far enough from the crack on (3), the traction term is zero since  and  far from the crack, leaving\n\n along (3), and  is due to bending stress for a cantilever beam\n\nwhere  is the length into the page. Using , one now has\n\nwhere the factor of 2 out front is due to there being 2 cantilever beams. Solving,\n\n Computational Methods In Fracture Mechanics \nA handful of methods exist for calculating  with finite elements. Although a direct calculation of the J-integral is possible (using the strains and stresses outputted by FEA), approximate approaches for some type of crack growth exist and provide reasonable accuracy with straightforward calculations. This section will elaborate on some relatively simple methods for fracture analysis utilizing numerical simulations.\n\n Nodal Release Method \nIf the crack is growing straight, the energy release rate can be decomposed as a sum of 3 terms  associated with the energy in each 3 modes. As a result, the Nodal Release method (NR) can be used to determine  from FEA results. The energy release rate is calculated at the nodes of the finite element mesh for the crack at an initial length and extended by a small distance . First, we calculate the displacement variation at the node of interest (before and after the crack tip node is released). Secondly, we keep track of the nodal force  outputted by FEA. Finally, we can find each components of  using the following formulas:\nlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nodal_Release_Debounded.png|thumb|582x582px|Figure 1: Crack debounding between two consecutive time steps using nodal release (NR)\nWhere  is the width of the element bounding the crack tip. The accuracy of the method highly depends on the mesh refinement, both because the displacement and forces depend on it, and because . Note that the equations above are derived using the crack closure integral.\n\nIf the energy release rate exceed a critical value, the crack will grow. In this case, a new FEA simulation is perfomed (for the next time step) where the node at the crack tip is released. For a bounded substrate, we may simply stop enforcing fixed Dirichlet boundary conditions at the crack tip node of the previous time step (i.e. displacements are no longer restrained) . For a symmetric crack, we would need to update the geometry of the domain with a longer crack opening (and therefore generate a new mesh).\n\n Modified Crack Closure Integral \nSimilar to the Nodal Release Method, the Modified Crack Closure Integral (MCCI) is a method for calculating the energy release rate utilizing FEA nodal displacements  and forces . Where  represents the direction corresponding to the Cartesian basis vectors  with origin at the crack tip, and  represents the nodal index. MCCI is more computationally efficient than the nodal release method because it only requires one analysis for each increment of crack growth.\n\nA necessary condition for the MCCI method is uniform element length  along the crack face in the direction. Additionally, this method requires sufficient discretization such that over the length of one element stress fields are self-similar. This implies that as the crack propagates. Below are examples of the MCCI method with two types of common finite elements.\n\n 4-Node Elements \nlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:4-node.png|alt=|thumb|347x347px|Figure 2: Schematic of the MCCI process for 4-node linear rectangular elements.\nThe 4-node square linear elements seen in Figure 2 have a distance between nodes  and  equal to  Consider a crack with its tip located at node  Similar to the nodal release method, if the crack were to propagate  one element length along the line of symmetry (parallel to the -axis) the crack opening displacement would be the displacement at the previous crack tip, i.e. and the force at the new crack tip  would be  Since the crack growth is assumed to be self-similar the displacement at node  after the crack propagates is equal to the displacement at node  before the crack propagates.  This same concept can be applied to the forces at node  and  Utilizing the same method shown in the nodal release section we recover the following equations for energy release rate:Where (displacement above and below the crack face respectively). Because we have a line of symmetry parallel to the crack, we can assume \n\nThus, \n\n 8-Node Elements \nlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:8-node.png|thumb|352x352px|Figure 3: Schematic of the MCCI process for 9-node quadratic rectangular elements.\nThe 8-node rectangular elements seen in Figure 3 have quadratic basis functions. The process for calculating G is the same as the 4-node elements with the exception that  (the crack growth over one element) is now the distance from node  to  Once again, making the assumption of self-similar straight crack growth the energy release rate can be calculated utilizing with the following equations:Like with the nodal release method the accuracy of MCCI is highly dependent on the level of discretization along the crack tip, i.e.  Accuracy also depends on element choice. A mesh of 8-node quadratic elements can produce more accurate results than a mesh of 4-node linear elements with the same number of degrees of freedom in the mesh.\n\n Domain Integral Approach for J \nlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Contour_Domain_Integral_J-Integral.png|thumb|309x309px|Figure 4: Contour domain integral for the J-Integral\nThe J-integral may be calculated directly using the finite element mesh and shape functions. We consider a domain countour as shown in figure 4 and choose an arbitrary smooth function  such that  on   and   on  .\n\nFor linear elastic cracks growing straight ahead, . The energy release rate can then be calculated over the area bounded by the contour using an updated formulation:\n\nThe formula above may be applied to any annular area surrounding the crack tip (in particular, a set of neighboring elements can be used). This method is very accurate, even with a coarse mesh arround the crack tip (one may choose an integration domain located far away, with stresses and displacement less sensitive to mesh refinment)\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Derivation of the J-integral for domain integral approach\n|-\n|\nThe J-intregral may be expressed over the full contour as follow:\n\nWith .  ,  on and the work and stresses cancel out on and ,  hence by application of the divergence theorem this leads to:\n\nFinally, by noting that and using the equilibrium equation:\n\n|}\n\n 2-D Crack Tip Singular Elements \nThe above-mentioned methods for calculating energy release rate asymptotically approach the actual solution with increased discretization, but fail to fully capture the crack tip singularity. More accurate simulations can be preformed by utilizing quarter-point elements around the crack tip. These elements have a built in singularity which more accurately produces stress fields around the crack tip. The advantage of the quarter-point method is that it allows for coarser finite element meshes and greatly reduces computational cost.  Furthermore, these elements are derived from small modifications to common finite elements without requiring special computational programs for analysis. For the purposes of this section elastic materials will be examined, although this method can be extended to elastic-plastic fracture mechanics. Assuming perfect elasticity the stress fields will experience a  crack tip singularity.\n\n 8-Node Isoparametric Element \nlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Finalfig5.png|thumb|Figure 5: Mapped and Parent Element of the 8-node isoparametric finite element. Note the quarter point location of the nodes in the mapped element.\nThe 8-node quadratic element are described by Figure 5 in both parent space with local coordinates  and  and by the mapped element in physical/global space by  and  The parent element is mapped from the local space to the physical space by the shape functions  and the degree of freedom coordinates  The crack tip is located at  or  In a similar way, displacements (defined as ) can also be mapped.A property of shape functions in the finite element method is compact support, specifically the Kronecker delta property (i.e.  at node  and zero at all other nodes). This results in the following shape functions for the 8-node quadratic elements:When considering a line in front of the crack that is co-linear with the - axis (i.e. )  all basis functions are zero except for Calculating the normal strain involves using the chain rule to take the derivative of displacement with respect to \nlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Triangle256.png|thumb|Figure 6: Triangular Element mapped from 8-node rectangular element.\nIf the nodes are spaced evenly on the rectangular element then the strain will not contain the singularity. By moving nodes 5 and 8 position to a quarter of the length   of the element closer to the crack tip as seen in figure 5, the mapping from  becomes:Solving for  and taking the derivative results in:Plugging this result into the equation for strain the final result is obtained:By moving the mid-nodes to a quarter position results in the correct  crack tip singularity.\n\n Other Element Types \nlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Triagneles2.png|thumb|330x330px|Figure 7: Natural Triangle Element\nThe rectangular element method does not allow for singular elements to be easily meshed around the crack tip. This impedes the ability to capture the angular dependence of the stress fields which is critical in determining the crack path. Also, except along the element edges the   singularity exists in a very small region near the crack tip. Figure 6 shows another quarter-point method for modeling this singularity. The 8-node rectangular element can be mapped into a triangle. This is done by collapsing the nodes on the line  to the mid-node location and shifting the mid-nodes on  to the quarter-point location.  The collapsed rectangle can more easily surround the crack tip but requires that the element edges be straight or the accuracy of calculating the stress intensity factor will be reduced.\n\nA better candidate for the quarter-point method is the natural triangle as seen in Figure 7. The element's geometry allows for the crack tip to be easily surrounded and meshing is simplified. Following the same procedure described above, the displacement and strain field for the triangular elements are:This method reproduces the first two terms of the Williams solutions with a constant and singular term.\n\nAn advantage of quarter-point method is that it can be easily generalized to 3-dimensional models. This can greatly reduce computation when compared to other 3-dimensional methods but can lead to error if that crack tip propagates with a large degree of curvature.\n\nSee also\n Fracture mechanics\n Stress intensity factor\n Fracture toughness\nJ-Integral\n\n References \n\nExternal links\n Fracture Mechanics Notes by Prof. Alan T.

In particular, generalizing the Vitali convergence theorem, the Fichera convergence theorem and previous results of Vladimir Mikhailovich Dubrovskii, he proved a necessary and sufficient condition for the passage to the limit under the sign of integral:See ,  and . this result is, in some sense, definitive.According to . In the field of ordinary differential equations, he studied existence and uniqueness problems under very general hypotheses for the left member of the given first order equation, developing an important approximation method and proving a fundamental uniqueness theorem.According to , who describes briefly these results, and to , who comprehensively present Cafiero's and other's research results in this field.\n\nLife and academic career\n\nCafiero was born in Riposto, Province of Catania, on May 24, 1914.See  and : his parents were from Meta di Sorrento, according to Miranda.

It was there that, after having successfully completed a dangerous sabotage operation, the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces surprised him and the other members of his unit, leaving them without any support. Nonetheless, in desperate conditions, he was able to lead his men to the Italian coasts with a rubber dinghy, and was awarded of a Silver Medal of Military Valor for this act.\n\nRebuilding and researching: the years from 1944 to 1953\n\nBeing discharged from Military Service on February 1944, he was not able to reach Rome and remained in Napoli.

It was also necessary to organize courses and exams for the numerous war veterans coming back from the front and for new students, with more than a half of the teaching personnel blocked beyond the Gothic Line: and in performing all those task Cafiero, jointly with few others and working as an adjuct professor of \"Esercitazioni di Matematiche\", was an outstanding collaborator of Renato Caccioppoli and Carlo Miranda.This highly positive assessment of his work during those years is due to  himself.\n\nAlso in 1944 he married Jole Giorgini, his lifelong companion, and soon after they had a daughter, Anna.\n\nDue to the scarce possibilities of being hired permanently by the Faculty of Sciences at that time, he accepted a position as adjunct assistant professor to the chair of Financial Mathematics,For the academic year 1944/45, according to . working with Luigi Lordi first at the Istituto Universitario Navale and then to the Faculty of Economics and Business, where he was appointed full assistant professor in June 1949. details briefly but comprehensively these early career steps, while  only outlines them.  state precisely the academic years and the course helds by Cafiero at the Institute.

    "text": "right|thumb|389x389px|Arithmetics. Pinturikkyo's list. Borgia's apartments. 1492 — 1495. Rome, Vatican palaces\nThe history of arithmetic includes the period from the emergence of counting before the formal definition of numbers and arithmetic operations over them by means of a system of axioms. Arithmetic — the science of numbers, their properties and their relations — is one of the main mathematical sciences. It is closely connected with algebra and the theory of numbers.\n\nThe practical need for counting, elementary measurements and calculations became the reason for the emergence of arithmetic. The first authentic data on arithmetic knowledge are found in the historical monuments of Babylon and Ancient Egypt in the third and second millennia BC. The big contribution to the development of arithmetic was made by the ancient Greek mathematicians, in particular Pythagoreans, who tried to define all regularities of the world in terms of numbers. In the Middle Ages trade and approximate calculations were the main scope of arithmetic. Arithmetic developed first of all in India and the countries of Islam and only then came to Western Europe. In the seventeenth century the needs of astronomy, mechanics, and more difficult commercial calculations put before arithmetic new challenges regarding methods of calculation and gave an impetus to further development.\n\nTheoretical justifications of the idea of number are connected first of all with the definition of \"natural number\" and Peano's axioms formulated in 1889. They were followed by strict definitions of rational, real, negative and complex numbers. Further expansion of the concept of number is possible only if one of the arithmetic laws is rejected.\n\n The  appearance of arithmetic \nright|thumb|324x324px|The Ishango bone, found near Lake Edward, possibly displaying a numbering system from more than 20,000 years ago.\n\nIf in two sets of subjects each element of one set has only one corresponding element in the other set, these sets are one-to-one. Such actual comparison when subjects were displayed in two ranks, was used by primitive tribes in trade. This approach gives the opportunity to establish quantitative ratios between groups of objects and doesn't demand the concept of number.\n\nFurther there were natural standards for counting, for example, fingers of hands, and then sets of standards, such as hands. The advent of the standards symbolizing concrete numbers also is connected to the emergence of the concept of number. Thus the number of things to be counted was compared to the Moon in the sky, the number of eyes, and the number of fingers on a hand. Later numerous standards were replaced with one of the most convenient, usually fingers of hands and/or feet.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Arithmetic\nCategory:History of mathematics"

The paper is one of Mandelbrot's first publications on the topic of fractals.\"Dr. Mandelbrot traced his work on fractals to a question he first encountered as a young researcher: how long is the coast of Britain?\": Benoit Mandelbrot (1967). \"Benoît Mandelbrot, Novel Mathematician, Dies at 85\", The New York Times.\n\nOverview\nThe paper examines the coastline paradox: the property that the measured length of a stretch of coastline depends on the scale of measurement. Empirical evidence suggests that the smaller the increment of measurement, the longer the measured length becomes. If one were to measure a stretch of coastline with a yardstick, one would get a shorter result than if the same stretch were measured with a  ruler. This is because one would be laying the ruler along a more curvilinear route than that followed by the yardstick. The empirical evidence suggests a rule which, if extrapolated, shows that the measure length increases without limit as the measurement scale decreases towards zero.\n\nThis discussion implies that it is meaningless to talk about the length of a coastline; some other means of quantifying coastlines are needed. Mandelbrot discusses an empirical law discovered by Lewis Fry Richardson, who observed that the measured length L(G) of various geographic borders was a function of the measurement scale G. Collecting data from several different examples, Richardson conjectured that L(G) could be closely approximated by a function of the form\n\nwhere M is a positive constant and D is a constant, called the dimension, greater than or equal to 1. Intuitively, if a coastline looks smooth it should have dimension close to 1; and the more irregular the coastline looks the closer its dimension should be to 2. The examples in Richardson's research have dimensions ranging from 1.02 for the coastline of South Africa to 1.25 for the West coast of Britain. \n\nMandelbrot then describes various mathematical curves, related to the Koch snowflake, which are defined in such a way that they are strictly self-similar. Mandelbrot shows how to calculate the Hausdorff dimension of each of these curves, each of which has a dimension D between 1 and 2 (he also mentions but does not give a construction for the space-filling Peano curve, which has a dimension exactly 2). He notes that the approximation of these curves with segments of length G have lengths of the form . The resemblance with Richardson's law is striking. The paper does not claim that any coastline or geographic border actually has fractional dimension. Instead, it notes that Richardson's empirical law is compatible with the idea that geographic curves, such as coastlines, can be modelled by random self-similar figures of fractional dimension.\n\nNear the end of the paper Mandelbrot briefly discusses how one might approach the study of fractal-like objects in nature that look random rather than regular. For this he defines statistically self-similar figures and says that these are encountered in nature.\n\nThe paper is important because it is a \"turning point\" in Mandelbrot's early thinking on fractals.\"What is the essence of a coastline, for example ? Mandelbrot asked this question in a paper that became a turning point for his thinking: 'How Long Is the Coast of Britain'\": James Gleick (1988) Chaos: Making a New Science, p.94. . It is an example of the linking of mathematical objects with natural forms that was a theme of much of his later work.\n\nSee also\n Coastline paradox\n List of countries by length of coastline\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Mathematics papers\nCategory:Works originally published in Science (journal)\nCategory:Fractals"

    "text": "In recursion theory, hyperarithmetic theory is a generalization of Turing computability.  It has close connections with definability in second-order arithmetic and with weak systems of set theory such as Kripke–Platek set theory.  It is an important tool in effective descriptive set theory.\n\nThe central focus of hyperarithmetic theory is the sets of natural numbers known as hyperarithmetic sets.  There are three equivalent ways of defining this class of sets; the study of the relationships between these different definitions is one motivation for the study of hyperarithmetical theory.\n\n Hyperarithmetical sets and definability \n\nThe first definition of the hyperarithmetic sets uses the analytical hierarchy. \nA set of natural numbers is classified at level  of this hierarchy if it is definable by a formula of second-order arithmetic with only existential set quantifiers and no other set quantifiers.  A set is classified at level  of the analytical hierarchy if it is definable by a formula of second-order arithmetic with only universal set quantifiers and no other set quantifiers.  A set is  if it is both  and .  The hyperarithmetical sets are exactly the  sets.\n\n Hyperarithmetical sets and iterated Turing jumps: the hyperarithmetical hierarchy\n\nThe definition of hyperarithmetical sets as  does not directly depend on computability results.  A second, equivalent, definition shows that the hyperarithmetical sets can be defined using infinitely iterated Turing jumps.  This second definition also shows that the hyperarithmetical sets can be classified into a hierarchy extending the arithmetical hierarchy; the hyperarithmetical sets are exactly the sets that are assigned a rank in this hierarchy.\n\nEach level of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy corresponds to a countable ordinal number (ordinal), but not all countable ordinals correspond to a level of the hierarchy. The ordinals used by the hierarchy are those with an ordinal notation, which is a concrete, effective description of the ordinal.\n\nAn ordinal notation is an effective description of a countable ordinal by a natural number. A system of ordinal notations is required in order to define the hyperarithmetic hierarchy. The fundamental property an ordinal notation must have is that it describes the ordinal in terms of small ordinals in an effective way. The following inductive definition is typical; it uses a pairing function .\n The number 0 is a notation for the ordinal 0.\n If n is a notation for an ordinal λ then  is a notation for λ + 1;\n Suppose that δ is a limit ordinal. A notation for δ is a number of the form , where e is the index of a total computable function  such that for each n,  is a notation for an ordinal λn less than δ and δ is the sup of the set .\n\nThere are only countably many ordinal notations, since each notation is a natural number; thus there is a countable ordinal which is the supremum of all ordinals that have a notation. This ordinal is known as the Church-Kleene ordinal and is denoted .  Note that this ordinal is still countable, the symbol being only an analogy with the first uncountable ordinal, .  The set of all natural numbers that are ordinal notations is denoted  and called Kleene's .\n\nOrdinal notations are used to define iterated Turing jumps. These are sets of natural numbers denoted  for each . Suppose that δ has notation e. The set  is defined using e as follows.\n If δ = 0 then  is the empty set. \n If δ = λ + 1 then  is the Turing jump of . The notations  and  are commonly used for  and , respectively. \n If δ is a limit ordinal, let  be the sequence of ordinals less than δ given by the notation e. The set  is given by the rule . This is the effective join of the sets .\nAlthough the construction of  depends on having a fixed notation for δ, and each infinite ordinal has many notations, a theorem of Spector shows that the Turing degree of  depends only on δ, not on the particular notation used, and thus  is well defined up to Turing degree.\n\nThe hyperarithmetical hierarchy is defined from these iterated Turing jumps. A set X of natural numbers is classified at level δ of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, for , if X is Turing reducible to . There will always be a least such δ if there is any; it is this least δ that measures the level of uncomputability of X.\n\n Hyperarithmetical sets and recursion in higher types \n\nA third characterization of the hyperarithmetical sets, due to Kleene, uses higher-type computable functionals. The type-2 functional  is defined by the following rules:\n if there is an i such that f(i) > 0,\n if there is no i such that f(i) > 0.\nUsing a precise definition of computability relative to a type-2 functional, Kleene showed that a set of natural numbers is hyperarithmetical if and only if it is computable relative to .\n\n Example: the truth set of arithmetic \n\nEvery arithmetical set is hyperarithmetical, but there are many other hyperarithmetical sets. One example of a hyperarithmetical, nonarithmetical set is the set T of Gödel numbers of formulas of Peano arithmetic that are true in the standard natural numbers . The set T is Turing equivalent to the set , and so is not high in the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, although it is not arithmetically definable by Tarski's indefinability theorem.\n\n Fundamental results \n\nThe fundamental results of hyperarithmetic theory show that the three definitions above define the same collection of sets of natural numbers. These equivalences are due to Kleene.\n\nCompleteness results are also fundamental to the theory. A set of natural numbers is  complete if it is at level  of the analytical hierarchy and every  set of natural numbers is many-one reducible to it. The definition of a  complete subset of Baire space () is similar.   Several sets associated with hyperarithmetic theory are  complete:\n Kleene's , the set of natural numbers that are notations for ordinal numbers\n The set of natural numbers e such that the computable function  computes the characteristic function of a well ordering of the natural numbers. These are the indices of recursive ordinals.\n The set of elements of Baire space that are the characteristic functions of a well ordering of the natural numbers (using an effective isomorphism .\n\nResults known as  bounding follow from these completeness results.  For any  set S of ordinal notations, there is an  such that every element of S is a notation for an ordinal less than .  For any subset T of Baire space consisting only of characteristic functions of well orderings, there is an  such that each ordinal represented in T is less than .\n\n Relativized hyperarithmeticity and hyperdegrees \n\nThe definition of  can be relativized to a set X of natural numbers: in the definition of an ordinal notation, the clause for limit ordinals is changed so that the computable enumeration of a sequence of ordinal notations is allowed to use X as an oracle. The set of numbers that are ordinal notations relative to X is denoted . The supremum of ordinals represented in  is denoted ; this is a countable ordinal no smaller than .\n\nThe definition of  can also be relativized to an arbitrary set  of natural numbers. The only change in the definition is that  is defined to be X rather than the empty set, so that  is the Turing jump of X, and so on.  Rather than terminating at  the hierarchy relative to X runs through all ordinals less than .\n\nThe relativized hyperarithmetical hierarchy is used to define hyperarithmetical reducibility. Given sets X and Y, we say  if and only if there is a  such that X is Turing reducible to . If  and  then the notation  is used to indicate X and Y are hyperarithmetically equivalent.  This is a coarser equivalence relation than Turing equivalence; for example, every set of natural numbers is hyperarithmetically equivalent to its Turing jump but not Turing equivalent to its Turing jump.  The equivalence classes of hyperarithmetical equivalence are known as hyperdegrees.\n\nThe function that takes a set X to  is known as the hyperjump by analogy with the Turing jump. Many properties of the hyperjump and hyperdegrees have been established.  In particular, it is known that Post's problem for hyperdegrees has a positive answer: for every set X  of natural numbers there is a set Y of natural numbers such that .\n\n Generalizations \n\nHyperarithmetical theory is generalized by α-recursion theory, which is the study of definable subsets of admissible ordinals. Hyperarithmetical theory is the special case in which α is .\n\nRelation to other hierarchies\n\n References \n H. Rogers, Jr., 1967.

    "text": "+Hyperbolic quaternion multiplication×1ijk11ijkii +1k −jjj −k +1ikkj −i +1\n\nIn abstract algebra, the algebra of hyperbolic quaternions is a nonassociative algebra over the real numbers with elements of the form\n\nwhere the squares of i, j, and k are +1 and distinct elements of {i, j, k} multiply with the anti-commutative property.\n\nThe four-dimensional algebra of hyperbolic quaternions incorporates some of the features of the older and larger algebra of biquaternions. They both contain subalgebras isomorphic to the split-complex number plane. Furthermore, just as the quaternion algebra H can be viewed as a union of complex planes, so the hyperbolic quaternion algebra is a union of split-complex number planes sharing the same real line.\n\nIt was Alexander Macfarlane who promoted this concept in the 1890s as his Algebra of Physics, first through the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1891, then through his 1894 book of five Papers in Space Analysis, and in a series of lectures at Lehigh University in 1900.\n\nAlgebraic structure\nLike the quaternions, the set of hyperbolic quaternions form a vector space over the real numbers of dimension 4.  A linear combination\n\nis a hyperbolic quaternion when   and  are real numbers and the basis set  has these products:\n\nUsing the distributive property, these relations can be used to multiply any two hyperbolic quaternions.\n\nUnlike the ordinary quaternions, the hyperbolic quaternions are not associative. For example, , while . In fact, this example shows that the hyperbolic quaternions are not even an alternative algebra.\n\nThe first three relations show that products of the (non-real) basis elements are anti-commutative.  Although this basis set does not form a group, the set\n\nforms a quasigroup. One also notes that any subplane of the set M of hyperbolic quaternions that contains the real axis forms a plane of split-complex numbers. If\n\nis the conjugate of , then the product\n\nis the quadratic form used in spacetime theory. In fact, for events p and q, the bilinear form \n \narises as the negative of the real part of the hyperbolic quaternion product pq*, and is used in Minkowski space.\n\nNote that the set of units U = {q : qq* ≠ 0 } is not closed under multiplication. See the references (external link) for details.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe hyperbolic quaternions form a nonassociative ring; the failure of associativity in this algebra curtails the facility of this algebra in transformation theory. Nevertheless, \nthis algebra put a focus on analytical kinematics by suggesting a mathematical model:\nWhen one selects a unit vector r in the hyperbolic quaternions, then r 2 = +1. The plane  with hyperbolic quaternion multiplication is a commutative and associative subalgebra isomorphic to the split-complex number plane.\nThe hyperbolic versor  transforms Dr by\n\nSince the direction r in space is arbitrary, this hyperbolic quaternion multiplication can express any Lorentz boost using the parameter a called rapidity. However, the hyperbolic quaternion algebra is deficient for representing the full Lorentz group (see biquaternion instead).\n\nWriting in 1967 about the dialogue on vector methods in the 1890s, a historian commented\nThe introduction of another system of vector analysis, even a sort of compromise system such as Macfarlane's, could scarcely be well received by the advocates of the already existing systems and moreover probably acted to broaden the question beyond the comprehension of the as-yet uninitiated reader.\n\nGeometry\nLater, Macfarlane published an article in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1900. In it he treats a model for hyperbolic space H3 on the hyperboloid\n\n.\n\nThis isotropic model is called the hyperboloid model and consists of all the hyperbolic versors in the ring of hyperbolic quaternions.\n\nHistorical review\nThe 1890s felt the influence of the posthumous publications of W. K. Clifford and the continuous groups of Sophus Lie. An example of a one-parameter group is the hyperbolic versor with the hyperbolic angle parameter. This parameter is part of the polar decomposition of a split-complex number. But it is a startling aspect of finite mathematics that makes the hyperbolic quaternion ring different:\n\nThe basis  of the vector space of hyperbolic quaternions is not closed under multiplication: for example, . Nevertheless, the set  is closed under multiplication. It satisfies all the properties of an abstract group except the associativity property; being finite, it is a Latin square or quasigroup, a peripheral mathematical structure. Loss of  the associativity property of multiplication as found in quasigroup theory is not consistent with linear algebra since all linear transformations compose in an associative manner. Yet physical scientists were calling in the 1890s for mutation of the squares of ,, and  to be  instead of  :\nThe Yale University physicist Willard Gibbs had pamphlets with the plus one square in his three-dimensional vector system. Oliver Heaviside in England wrote columns in the Electrician, a trade paper, advocating the positive square. In 1892 he brought his work together in Transactions of the Royal Society A where he says his vector system is\nsimply the elements of Quaternions without quaternions, with the notation simplified to the uttermost, and with the very inconvenient minus sign before scalar product done away with.\n\nSo the appearance of Macfarlane's hyperbolic quaternions had some motivation, but the disagreeable non-associativity precipitated a reaction. Cargill Gilston Knott was moved to offer the following:\n\nTheorem (Knott read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh 19 December 1892 and published in Proceedings 1892)\nIf a 4-algebra on basis  is associative and off-diagonal products are given by Hamilton's rules, then .\n\nProof:\n, so . Cycle the letters , ,  to obtain . QED.\n\nThis theorem needed statement to justify resistance to the call of the physicists and the Electrician. The quasigroup stimulated a considerable stir in the 1890s: the journal Nature was especially conducive to an exhibit of what was known by giving two digests of Knott's work as well as those of several other vector theorists. Michael J. Crowe devotes chapter six of his book A History of Vector Analysis to the various published views, and notes the hyperbolic quaternion:\n\nMacfarlane constructed a new system of vector analysis more in harmony with Gibbs–Heaviside system than with the quaternion system. ...he...defined a full product of two vectors which was comparable to the full quaternion product except that the scalar part was positive, not negative as in the older system.\n\nIn 1899 Charles Jasper Joly noted the hyperbolic quaternion and the non-associativity property while ascribing its origin to Oliver Heaviside.\n\nThe hyperbolic quaternions, as the Algebra of Physics, undercut the claim that ordinary quaternions made on physics. As for mathematics, the hyperbolic quaternion is another hypercomplex number, as such structures were called at the time. By the 1890s Richard Dedekind had introduced the ring concept into commutative algebra, and the vector space concept was being abstracted by Giuseppe Peano. In 1899 Alfred North Whitehead promoted Universal algebra, advocating for inclusivity. The concepts of quasigroup and algebra over a field are examples of mathematical structures describing hyperbolic quaternions.\n\nMacfarlane's hyperbolic quaternion paper of 1900\nThe Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh published \"Hyperbolic Quaternions\" \nin 1900, a paper in which Macfarlane regains associativity for multiplication by reverting \nto complexified quaternions. While there he used some expressions later \nmade famous by Wolfgang Pauli: where Macfarlane wrote\n \n\n,\nthe Pauli matrices satisfy\n\nwhile referring to the same complexified quaternions.\n\nThe opening sentence of the paper is \"It is well known that quaternions are intimately connected with spherical trigonometry and in fact they reduce the subject to a branch of algebra.\" This statement may be verified by reference to the contemporary work Vector Analysis which works with a reduced quaternion system based on dot product and cross product. In Macfarlane's paper there is an effort to produce \"trigonometry on the surface of the equilateral hyperboloids\" through the algebra of hyperbolic quaternions, now re-identified in an associative ring of eight real dimensions. The effort is reinforced by a plate of nine figures on page 181.  They illustrate the descriptive power of his \"space analysis\" method. For example, figure 7 is the \ncommon Minkowski diagram used today in special relativity to discuss change of velocity of a frame of reference and relativity of simultaneity.\n\nOn page 173 Macfarlane expands on his greater theory of quaternion variables. By way of contrast he notes that Felix Klein appears not to look beyond the theory of Quaternions and spatial rotation.\n\nReferences\n\n Internet Archive (free), or Google Books (free).

    "text": "Independence-friendly logic (IF logic; proposed by Jaakko Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu in 1989)Hintikka&Sandu1989 is an extension of classical first-order logic (FOL) by means of slashed quantifiers of the form  and  ( being a finite set of variables). The intended reading of  is \"there is a  which is functionally independent from the variables in \". IF logic allows one to express more general patterns of dependence between variables than those which are implicit in first-order logic. This greater level of generality leads to an actual increase in expressive power; the set of IF sentences can characterize the same classes of structures as existential second-order logic (). For example, it can express branching quantifier sentences, such as the formula   which expresses infinity in the empty signature; this cannot be done in FOL.  Therefore, first-order logic cannot, in general, express this pattern of dependency, in which  depends only on  and , and  depends only on  and . IF logic is more general than branching quantifiers, for example in that it can express dependencies that are not transitive, such as in the quantifier prefix  ( depends on , and  depends on , but  does not depend on ).\n\nThe introduction of IF logic was partly motivated by the attempt of extending the game semantics of first-order logic to games of imperfect information. Indeed, a semantics for IF sentences can be given in terms of these kinds of games (or, alternatively, by means of a translation procedure to existential second-order logic). A semantics for open formulas cannot be given in the form of a Tarskian semantics (Cameron&Hodges 2001); an adequate semantics must specify what it means for a formula to be satisfied by a set of assignments of common variable domain (a team) rather than satisfaction by a single assignment. Such a team semantics was developed by Hodges (Hodges 1997).\n\nIF logic is translation equivalent, at the level of sentences, with a number of other logical systems based on team semantics, such as dependence logic, dependence-friendly logic, exclusion logic and independence logic; with the exception of the latter, IF logic is known to be equiexpressive to these logics also at the level of open formulas. However, IF logic differs from all the above-mentioned systems in that it lacks locality (the meaning of an open formula cannot be described just in terms of the free variables of the formula; it is instead dependent on the context in which the formula occurs).\n\nIF logic shares a number of metalogical properties with first-order logic, but there are some differences, including lack of closure under (classical, contradictory) negation and higher complexity for deciding the validity of formulas. Extended IF logic addresses the closure problem, but its game-theoretical semantics is more complicated, and such logic corresponds to a larger fragment of second-order logic, a proper subset of  (Figueira, Gorin & Grimson 2011).\n\nHintikka has argued (e.g. in the book Hintikka 1996) that IF and extended IF logic should be used as a basis for the foundations of mathematics; this proposal has been met in some cases with skepticism (see e.g.Feferman2006).\n\n Syntax \n\nA number of slightly different presentations of IF logic have appeared in the literature; here we follow.Mann, Sandu & Sevenster 2011\n\nTerms and atomic formulas\nTerms and atomic formulas are defined exactly as in first-order logic with equality.\n\nIF formulas\n\nFor a fixed signature σ, formulas of IF logic are defined as follows:\n\n Any atomic formula  is an IF formula.\n If  is an IF formula, then  is an IF formula. \n If  and  are IF formulas, then  and  are IF formulas.\n If  is a formula,  is a variable, and  is a finite set of variables, then  and  are also IF formulas.\n\nFree variables\n\nThe set  of the free variables of an IF formula  is defined inductively as follows:\n \n If  is an atomic formula, then  is the set of all variables occurring in it. \n ;\n ;\n .\n\nThe last clause is the only one that differs from the clauses for first-order logic, the difference being that also the variables in the slash set  are counted as free variables.\n\nIF Sentences\n\nAn IF formula  such that  is an IF sentence.\n\n Semantics \n\nThree main approaches have been proposed for the definition of the semantics of IF logic. The first two, based respectively on games of imperfect information and on Skolemization, are mainly used in the definition of IF sentences only. The former generalizes a similar approach, for first-order logic, which was based instead on games of perfect information.\nThe third approach, team semantics, is a compositional semantics in the spirit of Tarskian semantics. However, this semantics does not define what it means for a formula to be satisfied by an assignment (rather, by a set of assignments).\nThe first two approaches were developed in earlier publications on if logic (Hintikka&Sandu 1989Sandu 1993); the third one by Hodges in 1997 (Hodges 1997Hodges 1997b).\n\nIn this section, we differentiate the three approaches by writing distinct pedices, as in . Since the three approaches are fundamentally equivalent, only the symbol  will be used in the rest of the article.\n\n Game-Theoretical Semantics \n\nGame-Theoretical Semantics assigns truth values to IF sentences according to the properties of some 2-player games of imperfect information. \nFor ease of presentation, it is convenient to associate games not only to sentences, but also to formulas. More precisely, one defines games  for each triple formed by an IF formula , a structure , and an assignment .\n\n Players \n\nThe semantic game  has two players, called Eloise (or Verifier) and Abelard (or Falsifier).\n\n Game rules \n\nThe allowed moves in the semantic game  are determined by the synctactical structure of the formula under consideration.\nFor simplicity, we first assume that  is in negation normal form, with negations symbols occurring only in front of atomic subformulas.\n\n If  is a literal, the game ends, and, if  is true in  (in the first-order sense), then Eloise wins; otherwise, Abelard wins.\n If , then Abelard chooses one of the subformulas , and the corresponding game  is played. \n If , then Eloises chooses one of the subformulas , and the corresponding game  is played. \n If , then Abelard chooses an element  of , and game  is played.\n If , then Eloise chooses an element  of , and game  is played.\n\nMore generally, if  is not in negation normal form, we can state, as a rule for negation, that, when a game  is reached, the players begin playing a dual game  in which the roles of Verifiers and Falsifier are switched.\n\n Histories \nInformally, a sequence of moves in a game  is a history. At the end of each history , some subgame  is played; we call  the assignment associated to , and  the subformula occurrence associated to . The player associated to  is Eloise in case the most external logical operator in  is  or , and Abelard in case it is  or .\n\nThe set  of allowed moves in a history  is  if the most external operator of  is  or ; it is  ( being any two distinct objects, symbolizing 'left' and 'right') in case the most external operator of  is  or .\n\nGiven two assignments  of same domain, and  we write  if  on any variable .\n\nImperfect information is introduced in the games by stipulating that certain histories are indistinguishable for the associated player; indistinguishable histories are said to form an 'information set'. Intuitively, if the history  is in the information set , the player associated to  does not know whether he is in  or in some other history of .\nConsider two histories  such that the associated  are identical subformula occurrences of the form  ( or ); if furthermore , we write  (in case ) or  (in case ), in order to specify that the two histories are indistinguishable for Eloise, resp. for Abelard. We also stipulate, in general, reflexivity of this relation: if , then ; and if , then .\n\n Strategies \n\nFor a fixed game , write  for the set of histories to which Eloise is associated, and similarly  for the set of histories of Abelard.\n\nA strategy for Eloise in the game  is any function that assigns, to any possible history in which it is Eloise's turn to play, a legal move; more precisely, any function  such that  for every history . One can define dually the strategies of Abelard.\n\nA strategy for Eloise is uniform if, whenever , ; for Abelard, if  implies .\n\nA strategy  for Eloise is winning if Eloise wins in each terminal history that can be reached by playing according to . Similarly for Abelard.\n\n Truth, falsity, indeterminacy \n\nAn IF sentence  is true in a structure  () if Eloise has a uniform winning strategy in the game . \nIt is false () if Abelard has a winning strategy.\nIt is undetermined if neither Eloise nor Abelard has a winning strategy.\n\n Conservativity \n\nThe semantics of IF logic thus defined is a conservative extension of first-order semantics, in the following sense. If  is an IF sentence with empty slash sets, associate to it the first-order formula  which is identical to it, except in that each IF quantifier  is replaced by the corresponding first-order quantifier . Then  iff  in the Tarskian sense; and  iff  in the Tarskian sense.\n\n Open formulas \n\nMore general games can be used to assign a meaning to (possibly open) IF formulas; more exactly, it is possible to define what it means for an IF formula  to be satisfied, on a structure , by a team  (a set of assignments of common variable domain  and codomain ).\nThe associated games  begin with the random choice of an assignment ; after this initial move, the game \n is played. The existence of a winning strategy for Eloise defines positive satisfaction (), and existence of a winning strategy for Abelard defines negative satisfaction ().\nAt this level of generality, Game-theoretical Semantics can be replaced by an algebraic approach, team semantics (defined below).\n\n Skolem Semantics \n\nA definition of truth for IF sentences can be given, alternatively, by means of a translation into existential second-order logic. The translation generalizes the Skolemization procedure of first-order logic. Falsity is defined by a dual procedure called Kreiselization.\n\n Skolemization \n\nGiven an IF formula , we first define its skolemization relativized to a finite set  of variables. For every existential quantifier  occurring in , let  be a new function symbol (a \"Skolem function\"). We write  for the formula which is obtained substituting, in , all free occurrences of the variable  with the term . The Skolemization of  relative to , , is defined by the following inductive clauses:\n\n if  is a literal.  \n if . \n.\n, where  is a list of the variables in .\n\nIf  is an IF sentence, its (unrelativized) Skolemization is defined as .\n\n Kreiselization \n\nGiven an IF formula , associate, to each universal quantifier  occurring in it, a new function symbol  (a \"Kreisel function\"). Then, the Kreiselization  of  relative to a finite set of variables , is defined by the following inductive clauses:\n\n if  is a literal.  \n.\n.\n, where is a list of the variables in .\n\nIf  is an IF sentence, its (unrelativized) Kreiselization is defined as .\n\n Truth, falsity, indeterminacy \n\nGiven an IF sentence  with  existential quantifiers, a structure , and a list of  functions of appropriate arities, we denote as  the expansion of  which assigns the functions  as interpretations for the Skolem functions of .\n\nAn IF sentence is true on a structure  () iff there is a tuple  of functions such that .\nSimilarly,  iff there is a tuple  of functions such that ; and  iff neither of the previous conditions holds.\n\nFor any IF sentence, Skolem Semantics returns the same values as Game-theoretical Semantics.\n\n Team Semantics \n\nBy means of team semantics, it is possible to give a compositional account of the semantics of IF logic. Truth and falsity are grounded on the notion of 'satisfiability of a formula by a team'.\n\n Teams \n\nLet   be a structure and let  be a finite set of variables. Then a team over  with domain  is a set of assignments over  with domain , that is, a set of functions  from  to .\n\n Duplicating and supplementing teams \n\nDuplicating and supplementing are two operations on teams which are related to the semantics of universal and existential quantification.\n\nGiven a team  over a structure  and a variable , the duplicating team  is the team .\n\nGiven a team  over a structure , a function  and a variable , the supplementing team  is the team .\n\nIt is customary to replace repeated applications of these two operation with more succinct notations, such as  for .\n\n Uniform functions on teams \n\nAs above, given two assignments  with same variable domain, we write  if  for every variable .\n\nGiven a team  on a structure  and a finite set  of variables, we say that a function  is -uniform if  whenever .\n\n Semantic clauses \n\nTeam semantics is three-valued, in the sense that a formula may happen to be positively satisfied by a team on a given structure, or negatively satisfied by it, or neither. The semantics clauses for positive and negative satisfaction are defined by simultaneous induction on the synctactical structure of IF formulas.\n\nPositive satisfaction:\n\n  if and only if, for every assignment ,  in the sense of first-order logic (that is, the tuple  is in the interpretation  of ).\n  if and only if, for every assignment ,  in the sense of first-order logic (that is, ).\n  if and only if .\n  if and only if  and .\n  if and only if there exist teams  and  such that  and  and  . \n  if and only if .\n  if and only if there exists a -uniform function such that .\n\nNegative satisfaction:\n\n  if and only if, for every assignment , the tuple  is not in the interpretation  of .\n  if and only if, for every assignment ,  .\n  if and only if .\n  if and only if  there exist teams  and  such that  and  and  .\n  if and only if  and . \n  if and only if there exists a -uniform function such that .\n  if and only if .\n\n Truth, falsity, indeterminacy \n\nAccording to team semantics, an IF sentence  is said to be true () on a structure  if it is satisfied on  by the singleton team , in symbols: . \nSimilarly,  is said to be false () on  if ; it is said to be undetermined () if  and .\n\n Relationship with Game-Theoretical Semantics \n\nFor any team  on a structure , and any IF formula , we have:\n iff \nand\n iff .\n\nFrom this it immediately follows that, for sentences , ,  and .\n\n Notions of equivalence \n\nSince IF logic is, in its usual acception, three-valued, multiple notions of formula equivalence are of interest.\n\n Equivalence of formulas \n\nLet  be two IF formulas.\n\n ( truth entails ) if  for any structure  and any team  such that .\n\n ( is truth equivalent to ) if  and .\n\n ( falsity entails ) if  for any structure  and any team  such that .\n\n ( is falsity equivalent to ) if  and .\n\n ( strongly entails to ) if  and .\n\n ( is strongly equivalent to ) if  and .\n\n Equivalence of sentences \n\nThe definitions above specialize for IF sentences as follows.\nTwo IF sentences  are truth equivalent if they are true in the same structures; they are falsity equivalent if they are false in the same structures; they are strongly equivalent if they are both truth and falsity equivalent.\n\nIntuitively, using strong equivalence amounts to considering IF logic as 3-valued (true/undetermined/false), while truth equivalence treats IF sentences as if they were 2-valued (true/untrue).\n\n Equivalence relative to a context \n\nMany logical rules of IF logic can be adequately expressed only in terms of more restricted notions of equivalence, which take into account the context in which a formula might appear.\n\nFor example, if  is a finite set of variables and , one can state that  is truth equivalent to  relative to  () in case  for any structure  and any team  of domain .\n\n Model-theoretic properties \n\n Sentence level \n\nIF sentences can be translated in a truth-preserving fashion into sentences of (functional) existential second-order logic () by means of the Skolemization procedure (see above). Vice versa, every  can be translated into an IF sentence by means of a variant of the Walkoe-Enderton translation procedure for partially-ordered quantifiers (Walkoe 1970Enderton 1970). In other words, IF logic and  are expressively equivalent at the level of sentences. This equivalence can be used to prove many of the properties that follow; they are inherited from  and in many cases similar to properties of FOL.\n\nWe denote by  a (possibly infinite) set of IF sentences.\n\n Löwenheim-Skolem property: if  has an infinite model, or arbitrarily large finite models, than it has models of every infinite cardinality.\n Existential compactness: if every finite  has a model, then also  has a model.\n Failure of deductive compactness: there are  such that , but  for any finite . This is a difference from FOL.\n Separation theorem: if  are mutually inconsistent IF sentences, then there is a FOL sentence  such that  and . This is a consequence of Craig's interpolation theorem for FOL.\n Burgess' theorem:Burgess 2003 if  are mutually inconsistent IF sentences, then there is an IF sentence  such that  and  (except possibly for one-element structures). In particular, this theorem reveals that the negation of IF logic is not a semantical operation with respect to truth equivalence (truth-equivalent sentences may have non-equivalent negations).\n Definability of truth:Sandu 1998 there is an IF sentence , in the language of Peano Arithmetic, such that, for any IF sentence ,  (where  denotes a Gödel numbering). A weaker statement also holds for nonstandard models of Peano Arithmetic (Väänänen 2007).\n\n Formula level \n\nThe notion of satisfiability by a team has the following properties:\n\nDownward closure: if  and , then .\nConsistency:  and  if and only if .\nNon-locality: there are  such that .\n\nSince IF formulas are satisfied by teams and formulas of classical logics are satisfied by assignments, there is no obvious intertranslation between IF formulas and formulas of some classical logic system. However, there is a translation procedureHodges 1997b of IF formulas into sentences of relational  (actually, one distinct translation  for each finite  and for each choice of a predicate symbol  of arity ). In this kind of translation, an extra n-ary predicate symbol  is used to represent an n-variable team . This is motivated by the fact that, once an ordering  of the variables of  has been fixed, it is possible to associate a relation  to the team . With this conventions, an IF formula is related to its translation thus:\n   \nwhere  is the expansion of  that assigns  as interpretation for the predicate .\n\nThrough this correlation, it is possible to say that, on a structure , an IF formula  of n free variables defines a family of n-ary relations over  (the family of the relations  such that ).\n\nIn 2009, Kontinen and Väänänen,Kontinen&Väänänen 2009 showed, by means of a partial inverse translation procedure, that the families of relations that are definable by IF logic are exactly those that are nonempty, downward closed and definable in relational  with an extra predicate  (or, equivalently, nonempty and definable by a  sentence in which  occurs only negatively).\n\n Extended IF logic \n\nIF logic is not closed under classical negation. The boolean closure of IF logic is known as extended IF logic and it is equivalent to a proper fragment of  (Figueira et al. 2011). Hintikka (1996, p. 196) claimed that \"virtually all of classical mathematics can in principle be done in extended IF first-order logic\".\n\n Properties and critique \nA number of properties of IF logic follow from logical equivalence with  and bring it closer to first-order logic including a compactness theorem, a Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, and a Craig interpolation theorem. (Väänänen, 2007, p. 86). However, Väänänen (2001) proved that the set of Gödel numbers of valid sentences of IF logic with at least one binary\npredicate symbol (set denoted by ValIF) is recursively isomorphic with the corresponding set of Gödel numbers of valid (full) second-order sentences in a vocabulary that contains one binary predicate symbol (set denoted by Val2). Furthermore, Väänänen showed that Val2 is the complete Π2-definable set of integers, and that it is Val2 not in  for any finite m and n. Väänänen (2007, pp. 136–139) summarizes the complexity results as follows:\n\n Problem  first-order logic  IF/dependence/ESO logic Decision  (r.e.)    Non-validity  (co-r.e.)    Consistency    Inconsistency   \n\nFeferman (2006) cites Väänänen's 2001 result to argue (contra Hintikka) that while satisfiability might be a first-order matter, the question of whether there is a winning strategy for Verifier over all structures in general \"lands us squarely in full second order logic\" (emphasis Feferman's). Feferman also attacked the claimed usefulness of the extended IF logic, because the sentences in  do not admit a game-theoretic interpretation.\n\n Notes \n\n See also \n Game Semantics\n Branching Quantifiers\n Dependence Logic\n\n References \n\n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n External links \nTero Tulenheimo, 2009.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitary_logic",
    "text": "An infinitary logic is a logic that allows infinitely long statements and/or infinitely long proofs. Some infinitary logics may have different properties from those of standard first-order logic. In particular, infinitary logics may fail to be compact or complete. Notions of compactness and completeness that are equivalent in finitary logic sometimes are not so in infinitary logics. Therefore for infinitary logics, notions of strong compactness and strong completeness are defined. This article addresses Hilbert-type infinitary logics, as these have been extensively studied and constitute the most straightforward extensions of finitary logic. These are not, however, the only infinitary logics that have been formulated or studied.\n\nConsidering whether a certain infinitary logic named Ω-logic is complete promises to throw light on the continuum hypothesis.\n\nA word on notation and the axiom of choice\nAs a language with infinitely long formulae is being presented, it is not possible to write such formulae down explicitly. To get around this problem a number of notational conveniences, which, strictly speaking, are not part of the formal language, are used.  is used to point out an expression that is infinitely long. Where it is unclear, the length of the sequence is noted afterwards. Where this notation becomes ambiguous or confusing, suffixes such as  are used to indicate an infinite disjunction over a set of formulae of cardinality . The same notation may be applied to quantifiers for example . This is meant to represent an infinite sequence of quantifiers for each  where .\n\nAll usage of suffixes and  are not part of formal infinitary languages.\n\nThe axiom of choice is assumed (as is often done when discussing infinitary logic) as this is necessary to have sensible distributivity laws.\n\nDefinition of Hilbert-type infinitary logics\n\nA first-order infinitary logic Lα,β, α regular, β = 0 or ω ≤ β ≤ α, has the same set of symbols as a finitary logic and may use all the rules for formation of formulae of a finitary logic together with some additional ones:\nGiven a set of formulae  then  and  are formulae. (In each case the sequence has length .)\nGiven a set of variables  and a formula  then  and  are formulae. (In each case the sequence of quantifiers has length .)\n\nThe concepts of free and bound variables apply in the same manner to infinite formulae. Just as in finitary logic, a formula all of whose variables are bound is referred to as a sentence.\n\nA theory T in infinitary logic  is a set of sentences in the logic. A proof in infinitary logic from a theory T is a sequence of statements of length  which obeys the following conditions: Each statement is either a logical axiom, an element of T, or is deduced from previous statements using a rule of inference. As before, all rules of inference in finitary logic can be used, together with an additional one:\n\nGiven a set of statements  which have occurred previously in the proof then the statement  can be inferred.\n\nThe logical axiom schemata specific to infinitary logic are presented below. Global schemata variables:  and  such that .\n\nFor each , \nChang's distributivity laws (for each ): , where  or , and \nFor , , where  is a well ordering of \nThe last two axiom schemata require the axiom of choice because certain sets must be well orderable. The last axiom schema is strictly speaking unnecessary as Chang's distributivity laws imply it, however it is included as a natural way to allow natural weakenings to the logic.\n\nCompleteness, compactness, and strong completeness\nA theory is any set of statements. The truth of statements in models are defined by recursion and will agree with the definition for finitary logic where both are defined. Given a theory T a statement is said to be valid for the theory T if it is true in all models of T.\n\nA logic  is complete if for every sentence S valid in every model there exists a proof of S. It is strongly complete if for any theory T for every sentence S valid in T there is a proof of S from T. An infinitary logic can be complete without being strongly complete.\n\nA cardinal  is weakly compact when for every theory T in  containing at most  many formulas, if every S  T of cardinality less than  has a model, then T has a model. A cardinal  is strongly compact when for every theory T in , without restriction on size, if every S  T of cardinality less than  has a model, then T has a model.\n\nConcepts expressible in infinitary logic\nIn the language of set theory the following statement expresses foundation:\n\nUnlike the axiom of foundation, this statement admits no non-standard interpretations. The concept of well foundedness can only be expressed in a logic which allows infinitely many quantifiers in an individual statement. As a consequence many theories, including Peano arithmetic, which cannot be properly axiomatised in finitary logic, can be in a suitable infinitary logic. Other examples include the theories of non-archimedean fields and torsion-free groups. These three theories can be defined without the use of infinite quantification; only infinite junctions are needed.\n\nComplete infinitary logics\nTwo infinitary logics stand out in their completeness. These are  and . The former is standard finitary first-order logic and the latter is an infinitary logic that only allows statements of countable size.\n\n is also strongly complete, compact and strongly compact.\n\n fails to be compact, but it is complete (under the axioms given above). Moreover, it satisfies a variant of the Craig interpolation property.\n\nIf  is strongly complete (under the axioms given above) then  is strongly compact (because proofs in these logics cannot use  or more of the given axioms).\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Systems of formal logic\nCategory:Non-classical logic"

    "title": "Interlingua",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua",
    "text": "Interlingua (; ISO 639 language codes ia, ina) is an Italic international auxiliary language (IAL), developed between 1937 and 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA). It ranks among the top most widely used IALs (along with Esperanto and Ido), and is the most widely used naturalistic IAL: in other words, its vocabulary, grammar and other characteristics are derived from natural languages, rather than being centrally planned. Interlingua was developed to combine a simple, mostly regular grammarSee Gopsill, F. P. Interlingua: A course for beginners. Part 1. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1987. Gopsill, here and elsewhere, characterizes Interlingua as having a simple grammar and no irregularities.The Interlingua Grammar suggests that Interlingua has a small number of irregularities. See Gode (1955). with a vocabulary common to the widest possible range of western European languages,Gode, Alexander, \"Introduction\", Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language, Revised Edition, New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 1971. making it unusually easy to learn, at least for those whose native languages were sources of Interlingua's vocabulary and grammar.Breinstrup, Thomas, Preface, Interlingua course for beginners, Bilthoven, Netherlands: Union Mundial pro Interlingua, 2006. Conversely, it is used as a rapid introduction to many natural languages.\n\nInterlingua literature maintains that (written) Interlingua is comprehensible to the hundreds of millions of people who speak Romance languages,Yeager, Leland B., \"Le linguistica como reclamo pro Interlingua\" (Linguistics as an advertisement for Interlingua), Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public, Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991. though it is actively spoken by only a few hundred.\n\nThe name Interlingua comes from the Latin words , meaning \"between\", and , meaning \"tongue\" or \"language\". These morphemes are identical in Interlingua. Thus, \"Interlingua\" would mean \"between language\".\n\n Rationale \nThe expansive movements of science, technology, trade, diplomacy, and the arts, combined with the historical dominance of the Greek and Latin languages have resulted in a large common vocabulary among European languages. With Interlingua, an objective procedure is used to extract and standardize the most widespread word or words for a concept found in a set of control languages: English, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, with German and Russian as secondary references. Words from any language are eligible for inclusion, so long as their internationality is shown by their presence in these control languages. Hence, Interlingua includes such diverse word forms as Japanese geisha and samurai, Arabic califa, Guugu Yimithirr gangurru (Interlingua: kanguru), and Finnish sauna.\n\nInterlingua combines this pre-existing vocabulary with a minimal grammar based on the control languages. People with a good knowledge of a Romance language, or a smattering of a Romance language plus a good knowledge of the international scientific vocabulary can frequently understand it immediately on reading or hearing it. The immediate comprehension of Interlingua, in turn, makes it unusually easy to learn. Speakers of other languages can also learn to speak and write Interlingua in a short time, thanks to its simple grammar and regular word formation using a small number of roots and affixes.Morris, Alice Vanderbilt, General Report , New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.\n\nOnce learned, Interlingua can be used to learn other related languages quickly and easily, and in some studies, even to understand them immediately. Research with Swedish students has shown that, after learning Interlingua, they can translate elementary texts from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. In one 1974 study, an Interlingua class translated a Spanish text that students who had taken 150 hours of Spanish found too difficult to understand. Gopsill has suggested that Interlingua's freedom from irregularities allowed the students to grasp the mechanisms of language quickly.\n\nWords in Interlingua retain their original form from the source language; they are altered as little as possible to fit Interlingua's phonotactics.  Each word retains its original spelling, pronunciation, and meanings. For this reason, Interlingua is frequently termed a naturalistic IAL.\n\nWhen compared to natural languages, Interlingua most resembles Spanish.\n\n History \n\nThe American heiress Alice Vanderbilt Morris (1874–1950) became interested in linguistics and the international auxiliary language movement in the early 1920s, and in 1924, Morris and her husband, Dave Hennen Morris, established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in New York City. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis. Morris developed the research program of IALA in consultation with Edward Sapir, William Edward Collinson, and Otto Jespersen.Falk, Julia S. \"Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States, Language and Communication, 15(3): pp. 241–259. Pergamon, 1995.\n\n International Auxiliary Language Association \nThe IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, numerous studies by Sapir, Collinson, and Morris Swadesh in the 1930s and 1940s. Alice Morris edited several of these studies and provided much of IALA's financial support.Bray, Mary Connell [1951] (1971), \"Foreword\", Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international Language, Second Edition, New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company. . . Retrieved on 2010-04-18. IALA also received support from such prestigious groups as the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation, the Research Corporation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, \"Le historia antenatal de interlingua\", Historia de interlingua, 2001, revised 2006.\n\nIn its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about languages and interlinguistics; and comparing extant IALs, including Esperanto, Esperanto II, Ido, Peano’s Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Novial, and Interlingue (Occidental). In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities. It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, who debated features and goals of their respective languages. With a \"concession rule\" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive.\n\nAt the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in Geneva in 1931, IALA began to break new ground; 27 recognized linguists signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in Rome in 1933. That same year, Herbert N. Shenton and Edward L. Thorndike became influential in IALA's work by authoring key studies in the interlinguistic field.\n\nThe first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken in 1937, when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary. However, the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.\n\nDevelopment of a new language\nOriginally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing interlanguages were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, \"Profunde recerca duce a un lingua\", Historia de interlingua, 2001, revised 2006.\n\nTo that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., Peano’s Interlingua, Novial and Interlingue) or systematic (e.g., Esperanto and Ido) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many, or even a majority, of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a Procrustean bed, forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where E. Clark Stillman established a new research staff. Stillman, with the assistance of Alexander Gode, developed a prototyping technique – an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of control languages.\n\nIn 1943 Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research. IALA began to develop models of the proposed language, the first of which were presented in Morris's General Report in 1945.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1948, French linguist André Martinet was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, \"Le natura, si – un schema, no\", Historia de interlingua, 2001, revised 2006.\n\nFour models were canvassed:\n\n    Model P     highly naturalistic, with word forms unchanged from the prototypes    Model M     moderately naturalistic, similar to Occidental    Model C     slightly schematic, along the lines of Novial    Model K     moderately schematic, similar to Ido (less schematic than Esperanto)\n\nThe results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models were rejected – K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M received somewhat more support than P. IALA decided on a compromise between P and M, with certain elements of C.\n\nMartinet took up a position at Columbia University in 1948, and Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development. The vocabulary and grammar of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized Interlingua Grammar and the 27,000-word Interlingua–English Dictionary (IED). In 1954, IALA  published an introductory manual entitled Interlingua a Prime Vista (\"Interlingua at First Sight\").\n\nInterlingua as presented by the IALA is very close to Peano’s Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), both in its grammar and especially in its vocabulary. Accordingly, the very name \"Interlingua\" was kept, yet a distinct abbreviation was adopted: IA instead of IL.\n\nSuccess, decline, and resurgence\nAn early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter Spectroscopia Molecular, published from 1952 to 1980.Breinstrup, Thomas, \"Un revolution in le mundo scientific\" (A revolution in the scientific world). Accessed January 16, 2007. In 1954, Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress in Washington, D.C. for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. Science Service, the publisher of Science Newsletter at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the International Organization for Standardization, which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries.\n\nThe IALA closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later. Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service, which hired Gode as head of its newly formed Interlingua Division.Biographias: Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch. Accessed January 16, 2007 Hugh E. Blair, Gode's close friend and colleague, became his assistant.Biographias: Hugh Edward Blair. Accessed January 16, 2007 A successor organization, the Interlingua Institute,Portrait del organisationes de interlingua. Access January 16, 2007. was founded in 1970 to promote Interlingua in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua summaries for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977.Esterhill, Frank, Interlingua Institute: A History. New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.\n\nInterlingua had attracted many former adherents of other international-language projects, notably Occidental and Ido. The former Occidentalist Ric Berger founded The Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI) in 1955, and by the late 1950s, interest in Interlingua in Europe had already begun to overtake that in North America.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, UMI has held international conferences every two years (typical attendance at the earlier meetings was 50 to 100) and launched a publishing programme that eventually produced over 100 volumes. Other Interlingua-language works were published by university presses in Sweden and Italy, and in the 1990s, Brazil and Switzerland.Bibliographia de Interlingua. Accessed January 16, 2007.Biographias: Ingvar Stenström. Accessed January 16, 2007 Several Scandinavian schools undertook projects that used Interlingua as a means of teaching the international scientific and intellectual vocabulary.\n\nIn 2000, the Interlingua Institute was dissolved amid funding disputes with the UMI; the American Interlingua Society, established the following year, succeeded the institute and responded to new interest emerging in Mexico.\n\nIn the Soviet bloc\nInterlingua was spoken and promoted in the Soviet bloc, despite attempts to suppress the language. In the German Democratic Republic, government officials confiscated the letters and magazines that the UMI sent to Walter Rädler, the Interlingua representative there.\"Interlingua usate in le posta\". Historia de Interlingua, 2001, revised 2006.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia, Július Tomin published his first article on Interlingua in the Slovak magazine Príroda a spoločnosť (Nature and Society) in 1971, after which he received several anonymous threatening letters.Breinstrup, Thomas. \"Persecutate pro parlar Interlingua.\" Panorama in Interlingua, 1995, Issue 5. He went on to become the Czech Interlingua representative, teach Interlingua in the school system, and publish a series of articles and books.Biographias: Július Tomin. Historia de Interlingua, 2001. Revised 2006.\n\nInterlingua today\n\nToday, interest in Interlingua has expanded from the scientific community to the general public. Individuals, governments, and private companies use Interlingua for learning and instruction, travel, online publishing, and communication across language barriers.Breinstrup, Thomas, \"Contactos directe con touristas e le gente local\", Historia de Interlingua, 2001, Revised 2006.Stenström, Ingvar, \"Experientias del inseniamento del vocabulario international in le nove gymnasio svedese\" (Experiences with the teaching of the international vocabulary in the new Swedish gymnasium), Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public per Ingvar Stenström e Leland B. Yeager, Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991. (High school in Europe is often called the gymnasium.) Interlingua is promoted internationally by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua. Periodicals and books are produced by many national organizations, such as the Societate American pro Interlingua, the Svenska Sällskapet för Interlingua, and the Union Brazilian pro Interlingua.\n\n Community \nIt is not certain how many people have an active knowledge of Interlingua. As noted above, Interlingua is claimed to be the most widely spoken naturalistic auxiliary language.\n\nInterlingua's greatest advantage is that it is the most widely understood international auxiliary language besides Interlingua (IL) de A.p.I. by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.Blandino, Giovanni, \"Le problema del linguas international auxiliari\", Philosophia del Cognoscentia e del Scientia, Rome, Italy: Pontificia Universitas Lateranensis, Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, 1989.\n\nInterlingua has active speakers on all continents, especially in South America and in Eastern and Northern Europe, most notably Scandinavia; also in Russia and Ukraine. There are copious Interlingua web pages,  including editions of Wikipedia and Wiktionary, and a number of periodicals, including Panorama in Interlingua from the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI) and magazines of the national societies allied with it. There are several active mailing lists, and Interlingua is also in use in certain Usenet newsgroups, particularly in the europa.* hierarchy. Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.\"Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua,\" Panorama in Interlingua, Issue 3, 2006.\n\nInterlingua is taught in many high schools and universities, sometimes as a means of teaching other languages quickly, presenting interlinguistics, or introducing the international vocabulary.Breinstrup, Thomas, \"Interlingua: Forte, Fructuose, Futur\", Historia de Interlingua, 2001, Revised 2006.Stenström, Ingvar, “The Interlingua of IALA: From ‘the linguists’ project’ of 1951 to the working ‘tool of international scientific communication’ of 1981”, Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public per Ingvar Stenström e Leland B. Yeager, Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991.Stenström, Ingvar, “Utilisation de Interlingua in le inseniamento de linguas” (Utilization of Interlingua in the teaching of languages), Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public per Ingvar Stenström e Leland B. Yeager, Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991. The University of Granada in Spain, for example, offers an Interlingua course in collaboration with the Centro de Formación Continua.\"A notar,\" Panorama in Interlingua, Issue 4, 2006.\n\nEvery two years, the UMI organizes an international conference in a different country. In the year between, the Scandinavian Interlingua societies co-organize a conference in Sweden. National organizations such as the Union Brazilian pro Interlingua also organize regular conferences.\n\n Orthography \nInterlingua has a largely phonemic orthography.\n\n Interlingua alphabet \nInterlingua uses the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet with no diacritics.Interlingua Alphabet on Omniglot The alphabet, pronunciation in IPA and letter name in Interlingua are:\n\n+ Interlingua alphabet Number 1234568891011121314151617181920212223242526Letters (upper case) A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  ZLetters (lower case) a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  zIPA     ,  1          ,                    3    ,   ,  4      ,       Names a  be  ce  de  e  ef  ge  ha  i  jota  ka  el  em  en  o  pe  cu  er  es  te  u  ve  duple ve  ix  ypsilon  zeta\n\n c is pronounced  (or optionally ) before \"e, i, y\"\n ch  is pronounced /ʃ/ in words of French origin e.g. 'chef' = /ʃef/ meaning \"chief\" or \"chef\", /k/ in words of Greek and Italian origin e.g. \"choro\" = /koro/ meaning \"chorus\" and more rarely /t͡ʃ/ in words of English or Spanish origin as in \"cochi\" /kot͡ʃi/ meaning \"car\" or \"coach\". Ch may be pronounced either /t͡ʃ/ or /ʃ/ depending on the speaker in many cases e.g. \"chocolate\" may be pronounced either /t͡ʃokolate/ or /ʃokolate/. \n q only appears in the digraph qu, which is pronounced  (but  in the conjunction and pronoun que and pronoun qui and in terms derived from them such as \"anque\" and \"proque\")\n t is generally , but ti followed by a vowel, unless stressed or preceded by \"s\",  is pronounced  (or optionally )\n g = /g/ \n but in -age = /ʒ/ (i.e. like 'j') and in several words of French origin \"orange\" = /oranʒe/ and \"mangiar\" = /manʒar/\n\nCollateral orthography\nThe book \"Grammar of Interlingua\" defines in §15 a \"collateral orthography\".\n\n Spelling of loanwords \nUnassimilated foreign loanwords, or borrowed words, are spelled as in their language of origin. Their spelling may contain diacritics, or accent marks. If the diacritics do not affect pronunciation, they are removed.\n\n Phonology \n\nthumb|Spoken Interlingua\n\nInterlingua is primarily a written language, and the pronunciation is not entirely settled. The sounds in parentheses are not used by all speakers.\n\n Bilabial Labio-dental Alveolar Post-alveolar Palatal Labial-velar Velar Glottal Plosive          Nasal     Tap   Fricative          () Affricates () Approximant   Lateral approximant  \n\n Front Back Close   Close-mid   Open\n\nPronunciation\nFor the most part, consonants are pronounced as in English, while the vowels are like Spanish. Written double consonants may be geminated as in Italian for extra clarity or pronounced as single as in English or French. Interlingua has five falling diphthongs, , and ,Gopsill, F. P., Interlingua today: A course for beginners, Sheffield, UK: British Interlingua Society, 1994. although  and  are rare.\n\n Stress \nThe general rule is that stress falls on the vowel before the last consonant (e.g., lingua, 'language', esser, 'to be', requirimento,  'requirement'), and where that is not possible, on the first vowel (via, 'way', io crea, 'I create'). There are a few exceptions, and the following rules account for most of them:\n Adjectives and nouns ending in a vowel followed by -le, -ne, or -re are stressed on the third-last syllable (fragile, margine, altere 'other', but illa impone 'she imposes').\n Words ending in -ica/-ico, -ide/-ido and -ula/-ulo, are stressed on the third-last syllable (politica, scientifico, rapide, stupido, capitula, seculo 'century').\n Words ending in -ic are stressed on the second-last syllable (cubic).\n\nSpeakers may pronounce all words according to the general rule mentioned above. For example, kilometro is acceptable, although kilometro is more common.\n\n Phonotactics \nInterlingua has no explicitly defined phonotactics. However, the prototyping procedure for determining Interlingua words, which strives for internationality, should in general lead naturally to words that are easy for most learners to pronounce. In the process of forming new words, an ending cannot always be added without a modification of some kind in between. A good example is the plural -s, which is always preceded by a vowel to prevent the occurrence of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end. If the singular does not end in a vowel, the final -s becomes -es.\n\n Loanwords \nUnassimilated foreign loanwords, or borrowed words, are pronounced as in their language of origin.\n\n Vocabulary \n\nWords in Interlingua may be taken from any language,Morris, Alice Vanderbilt, \"IALA's system: Underlying facts and reasoning\" , General report, New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945. as long as their internationality is verified by their presence in seven control languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, and English, with German and Russian acting as secondary controls. These are the most widely spoken Romance, Germanic, and Slavic languages, respectively. Because of their close relationship, Spanish and Portuguese are treated as one unit. The largest number of Interlingua words are of Latin origin, with the Greek and Germanic languages providing the second and third largest number. The remainder of the vocabulary originates in Slavic and non-Indo-European languages.\n\n Eligibility \n\nA word, that is a form with meaning, is eligible for the Interlingua vocabulary if it is verified by at least three of the four primary control languages. Either secondary control language can substitute for a primary language. Any word of Indo-European origin found in a control language can contribute to the eligibility of an international word.Stillman, E. Clark, and Gode, Alexander, Interlinguistic standardization, New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1943. Articles 82–100 translated by Stanley A. Mulaik. Revised 2006. In some cases, the archaic or potential presence of a word can contribute to its eligibility.\n\nA word can be potentially present in a language when a derivative is present, but the word itself is not. English proximity, for example, gives support to Interlingua proxime, meaning 'near, close'. This counts as long as one or more control languages actually have this basic root word, which the Romance languages all do. Potentiality also occurs when a concept is represented as a compound or derivative in a control language, the morphemes that make it up are themselves international, and the combination adequately conveys the meaning of the larger word. An example is Italian fiammifero (lit. flamebearer), meaning \"match, lucifer\", which leads to Interlingua flammifero, or \"match\". This word is thus said to be potentially present in the other languages although they may represent the meaning with a single morpheme.\n\nWords do not enter the Interlingua vocabulary solely because cognates exist in a sufficient number of languages. If their meanings have become different over time, they are considered different words for the purpose of Interlingua eligibility. If they still have one or more meanings in common, however, the word can enter Interlingua with this smaller set of meanings.\n\nIf this procedure did not produce an international word, the word for a concept was originally taken from Latin (see below). This only occurred with a few grammatical particles.\n\n Form \nThe form of an Interlingua word is considered an international prototype with respect to the other words. On the one hand, it should be neutral, free from characteristics peculiar to one language. On the other hand, it should maximally capture the characteristics common to all contributing languages. As a result, it can be transformed into any of the contributing variants using only these language-specific characteristics. If the word has any derivatives that occur in the source languages with appropriate parallel meanings, then their morphological connection must remain intact; for example, the Interlingua word for 'time' is spelled tempore and not *tempus or *tempo in order to match it with its derived adjectives, such as temporal.Gode, Alexander, \"Introduction\", Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language, Revised Edition, New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 1971. See \"Forms of international words in derivational series\".\n\nThe language-specific characteristics are closely related to the sound laws of the individual languages; the resulting words are often close or even identical to the most recent form common to the contributing words. This sometimes corresponds with that of Vulgar Latin. At other times, it is much more recent or even contemporary. It is never older than the classical period.\n\n An illustration \nThe French œil, Italian occhio, Spanish ojo, and Portuguese olho appear quite different, but they descend from a historical form oculus. German Auge, Dutch oog and English eye (cf. Czech and Polish oko, Ukrainian око (óko)) are related to this form in that all three descend from Proto-Indo-European *okʷ. In addition, international derivatives like ocular and oculista occur in all of Interlingua's control languages. Each of these forms contributes to the eligibility of the Interlingua word. German and English base words do not influence the form of the Interlingua word, because their Indo-European connection is considered too remote.Gode, Alexander, \"Introduction\", Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language, Revised Edition, New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 1971. See \"Methods and techniques: Non-Latin examples\". Instead, the remaining base words and especially the derivatives determine the form oculo found in Interlingua.\n\n Notes on Interlingua vocabulary \nNew words can be derived internally – that is, from existing Interlingua words – or extracted from the control languages in the manner of the original vocabulary. Internal word-building, though freer than in the control languages, is more limited than in schematic languages.\n\nOriginally, a word was taken from Latin if the usual procedure did not produce a sufficiently international word. More recently, modern alternatives have become generally accepted. For example, the southern Romance comprar, meaning 'to buy', has replaced emer, because the latter occurs only in derivatives in the control languages. Similarly, the modern form troppo, 'too' or 'too much', has replaced nimis, and ma 'but' has largely replaced sed.\n\n Grammar \n\nInterlingua has been developed to omit any grammatical feature that is absent from any one primary control language. Thus, Interlingua has no noun–adjective agreement by gender, case, or number (cf. Spanish and Portuguese gatas negras or Italian gatte nere, 'black female cats'), because this is absent from English, and it has no progressive verb tenses (English I am reading), because they are absent from French. Conversely, Interlingua distinguishes singular nouns from plural nouns because all the control languages do.  With respect to the secondary control languages, Interlingua has articles, unlike Russian.\n\nThe definite article le is invariable, as in English. Nouns have no grammatical gender.Wilgenhof, Karel. Grammatica de Interlingua. Union Mundial pro Interlingua, Beekbergen, Netherlands, 1995. Plurals are formed by adding -s, or -es after a final consonant. Personal pronouns take one form for the subject and one for the direct object and reflexive. In the third person, the reflexive is always se. Most adverbs are derived regularly from adjectives by adding -mente, or -amente after a -c. An adverb can be formed from any adjective in this way.Brauers, Karl. Grammatica synoptic de Interlingua. Morges, Switzerland: Editiones Interlingua, 1975.\n\nVerbs take the same form for all persons (io vive, tu vive, illa vive, 'I live', 'you live', 'she lives'). The indicative (pare, 'appear', 'appears') is the same as the imperative (pare! 'appear!'), and there is no subjunctive. Three common verbs usually take short forms in the present tense: es for 'is', 'am', 'are;' ha for 'has', 'have;' and va for 'go', 'goes'. A few irregular verb forms are available, but rarely used.These are optional short forms for esser, 'to be'. They are found in Wilgenhof, who stops short of calling them irregular verb forms. Two such forms appear in Gode and Blair, and one is labeled irregular; none are in Brauers.\n\nThere are four simple tenses (present, past, future, and conditional), three compound tenses (past, future, and conditional), and the passive voice. The compound structures employ an auxiliary plus the infinitive or the past participle (e.g., Ille ha arrivate, 'He has arrived'). Simple and compound tenses can be combined in various ways to express more complex tenses (e.g., Nos haberea morite, 'We would have died').See for example Gode (1955), §115, \"Table of Conjugation\", pp. 38–40.\n\nWord order is subject–verb–object, except that a direct object pronoun or reflexive pronoun comes before the verb (Io les vide, 'I see them'). Adjectives may precede or follow the nouns they modify, but they most often follow it. The position of adverbs is flexible, though constrained by common sense.\n\nThe grammar of Interlingua has been described as similar to that of the Romance languages, but greatly simplified, primarily under the influence of English. More recently, Interlingua's grammar has been likened to the simple grammars of Japanese and particularly Chinese.Yeager, Leland B., \"Artificialitate, ethnocentrismo, e le linguas oriental: Le caso de Interlingua\", Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public per Ingvar Stenstrom e Leland B. Yeager, Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991.\n\n Criticisms and controversies \n\nSome opponents argue that, being based on a few European languages, Interlingua is best suited for speakers of European languages. Others contend that Interlingua has spelling irregularities that, while internationally recognizable in written form, increase the time needed to fully learn the language, especially for those unfamiliar with Indo-European languages. A related point of criticism is that Interlingua's credential as being Standard Average European is too weak outside the Romance languages. Some opponents see the Germanic, Slavic, and Celtic languages, in particular, as having little influence.\n\nProponents argue that Interlingua's source languages include not only Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and loan translations are included. Tests had shown that if a larger number of source languages were used, the results would be about the same. So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.\n\n Samples \nFrom an essay by Alexander Gode:\n\nInterlingua se ha distachate ab le movimento pro le disveloppamento e le introduction de un lingua universal pro tote le humanitate. Si o non on crede que un lingua pro tote le humanitate es possibile, si o non on crede que interlingua va devenir un tal lingua es totalmente indifferente ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme. Le sol facto que importa (ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme) es que interlingua, gratias a su ambition de reflecter le homogeneitate cultural e ergo linguistic del occidente, es capace de render servicios tangibile a iste precise momento del historia del mundo. Il es per su contributiones actual e non per le promissas de su adherentes que interlingua vole esser judicate.Novas de Interlingua, May/June 1958.\n\nInterlingua has detached itself from the movement for the development and introduction of a universal language for all humanity. Whether or not one believes that a language for all humanity is possible, whether or not one believes that Interlingua will become such a language is totally irrelevant from the point of view of Interlingua itself. The only fact that matters (from the point of view of Interlingua itself) is that Interlingua, thanks to its ambition of reflecting the cultural and thus linguistic homogeneity of the West, is capable of rendering tangible services at this precise moment in the history of the world. It is by its present contributions and not by the promises of its adherents that Interlingua wishes to be judged.\n\n+ The Lord's Prayer Interlingua Lingua Franca Nova Latino sine flexione Esperanto Ido Latin Spanish Italian English (traditional)Patre nostre, qui es in le celos,\nque tu nomine sia sanctificate;\nque tu regno veni;\nque tu voluntate sia facite\ncomo in le celo, etiam super le terra.Nos Padre, ci es en sielo,\nsante es tua nome;\ntua renia va veni;\ntua vole va es fada\nen tera como en sielo.Patre nostro, qui es in celos,\nque tuo nomine fi sanctificato;\nque tuo regno adveni;\nque tuo voluntate es facto\nsicut in celo et in terra.Patro nia, Kiu estas en la ĉielo,\nsanktigata estu Via nomo.\nVenu Via regno,\nfariĝu Via volo,\nkiel en la ĉielo tiel ankaŭ sur la tero.Patro nia, qua esas en la cielo,\ntua nomo santigesez;\ntua regno advenez;\ntua volo facesez quale en la cielo\ntale anke sur la tero.Pater noster, qui es in caelis,\nsanctificetur nomen tuum.\nAdveniat regnum tuum.\nFiat voluntas tua,\nsicut in caelo, et in terra.Padre nuestro, que estás en los cielos,\nsantificado sea tu Nombre;\nvenga a nosotros tu Reino;\nhágase tu Voluntad\nasí en la tierra como en el cielo.Padre nostro che sei nei cieli, \nsia santificato il tuo Nome, \nvenga il tuo Regno, \nsia fatta la tua Volontà \ncome in cielo così in terra.

It consists of a white four-pointed star extending to the edges of the flag and dividing it into an upper blue and lower red half. The star is symbolic of the four cardinal directions, and the two halves symbolize Romance and non-Romance speakers of Interlingua who understand each other.\n\nAnother symbol of Interlingua is a globe surrounded by twelve stars on a black or blue background, echoing the twelve stars of the Flag of Europe (because the source languages of Interlingua are purely European).

    "text": "Ivor Owen Grattan-Guinness (23 June 1941 – 12 December 2014) was a historian of mathematics and logic.\n\nLife\nGrattan-Guinness was born in Bakewell, England; his father was a mathematics teacher and educational administrator. He gained his bachelor degree as a Mathematics Scholar at Wadham College, Oxford, and an MSc (Econ) in Mathematical Logic and the Philosophy of Science at the London School of Economics in 1966. He gained both the doctorate (PhD) in 1969, and higher doctorate (D.Sc.) in 1978, in the History of Science at the University of London.  He was Emeritus Professor of the History of Mathematics and Logic at Middlesex University, and a Visiting Research Associate at the London School of Economics.\n\nHe was awarded the Kenneth O. May Medal for services to the History of Mathematics by the International Commission on the History of Mathematics (ICHM) on 31 July 2009, at Budapest, on the occasion of the 23rd International Congress for the History of Science.Report on the Awarding of the Kenneth O. May Prize to Ivor Grattan-Guinness and Rhada Charan Gupta on the Occasion of the 23rd International Congress of History of Science and Technology, Craig Fraser, ICHM, retrieved 2015-02-04. In 2010, he was elected an Honorary Member of the Bertrand Russell Society.\n\nGrattan-Guinness spent much of his career at Middlesex University. He was a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, United States, and a member of the International Academy of the History of Science.Member profile, IAHS, retrieved 2015-02-04.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1981, Grattan-Guinness was editor of the history of science journal Annals of Science. In 1979 he founded the journal History and Philosophy of Logic, and edited it until 1992. He was an associate editor of Historia Mathematica for twenty years from its inception in 1974, and again from 1996.\n\nHe also acted as advisory editor to the editions of the writings of C.S. Peirce and Bertrand Russell, and to several other journals and book series. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the International Commission on the History of Mathematics from 1977 to 1993.\n\nGrattan-Guinness gave over 570 invited lectures to organisations and societies, or to conferences and congresses, in over 20 countries around the world. These lectures include tours undertaken in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, South Africa and Portugal.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1988, Grattan-Guinness was the President of the British Society for the History of Mathematics, and for 1992 the Vice-President. In 1991, he was elected an effective member of the Académie Internationale d'Histoire des Sciences. He was the Associate Editor for mathematicians and statisticians for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004).\n\nGrattan-Guinness took an interest in the phenomenon of coincidence and has written on it for the Society for Psychical Research. He claimed to have a recurrent affinity with one particular number, namely the square of 15 (225), even recounting one occasion when a car was in front of him with the number plate IGG225, i.e. his very initials and that number. He died of heart failure on 12 December 2014, aged 73, survived by his wife Enid Grattan-Guinness.\n\nWork\nThe work of Grattan-Guinness touched on all historical periods, but he specialised in the development of the calculus and mathematical analysis, and their applications to mechanics and mathematical physics, and in the rise of set theory and mathematical logic. He was especially interested in characterising how past thinkers, far removed from us in time, view their findings differently from the way we see them now (for example, Euclid). He has emphasised the importance of ignorance as an epistemological notion in this task. He did extensive research with original sources both published and unpublished, thanks to his reading and spoken knowledge of the main European languages.\n\nSelected publications\n\nBooks written\n 1970.

The central theme of the book is the rise of logicism, thanks to the efforts of Frege, Bertrand Russell, and Alfred Whitehead, and its demise due to Gödel and indifference. Whole chapters are devoted to the emergence of algebraic logic in the 19th century UK, Cantor and the emergence of set theory, the emergence of mathematical logic in Germany told in a way that downplays Frege's importance, and to Peano and his followers. There follow four chapters devoted to the ideas of the young Bertrand Russell, the writing of both The Principles of Mathematics  and Principia Mathematica, and to the mixed reception the ideas and methods encountered over the period 1910–40. The book touches on the rise of model theory as well as proof theory, and on the emergence of American research on the foundation of mathematics, especially in the hands of E. H. Moore and his students, of the postulate theorists, and of Quine. While Polish logic is often mentioned, it is not covered systematically. Finally, the book is a contribution to the history of philosophy as well as of mathematics.\n\nBooks edited\n 2003.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Richard",
    "text": "Jules Richard (12 August 1862 – 14 October 1956) was a French mathematician.\n\n Life and  works\nRichard was born in Blet, in the Cher département.\n\nHe taught at the lycées of Tours, Dijon and Châteauroux. He obtained his doctorate, at age of 39, from the Faculté des Sciences in Paris. His thesis of 126 pages concerns Fresnel's wave-surface. Richard worked mainly on the foundations of mathematics and geometry, relating to works by Hilbert, von Staudt and Méray.\n\nIn a more philosophical treatise about the nature of axioms of geometry Richard discusses and rejects the following basic principles:\n Geometry is founded on arbitrarily chosen axioms - there are infinitely many equally true geometries. \n Experience provides the axioms of geometry, the basis is experimental, the development deductive. \n The axioms of geometry are definitions (in contrast to (1)).\n Axioms are neither experimental nor arbitrary, they force themselves on us since without them experience is not possible. \n\nThe latter approach was essentially that proposed by Kant. Richard arrived at the result that the notion of identity of two objects and the invariability of an object are too vague and need to be specified more precisely. This should be done by axioms.\n\nFurther according to Richard, it is the aim of science to explain the material universe. And although non-Euclidean geometry had not found any applications (Albert Einstein finished his general theory of relativity only in 1915), Richard already stated clairvoyantly:\n\nRichard corresponded with Giuseppe Peano and Henri Poincaré. He became known to more than a small group of specialists by formulating his paradox which was extensively use by Poincaré to attack set theory whereupon the advocates of set theory had to refute these attacks.\n\nHe died in 1956 in Châteauroux, in the Indre département, at the age of 94.\n\n Richard's Paradox \n\nThe paradox was first stated in 1905 in a letter to Louis Olivier, director of the Revue générale des sciences pures et appliquées. It was published in 1905 in the article Les Principes des mathématiques et le problème des ensembles. The Principia Mathematica by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell quote it together with six other paradoxes concerning the problem of self-reference. In one of the most important compendia of mathematical logic, compiled by Jean van Heijenoort, Richard's article is translated into English. The paradox can be interpreted as an application of Cantor's diagonal argument. It inspired Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing to their famous works. Kurt Gödel considered his incompleteness theorem as analogous to Richard's paradox which, in the original version runs as follows:\n\nLet E be the set of real numbers that can be defined by a finite number of words. This set is denumerable. Let p be the nth decimal of the nth number of the set E; we form a number N having zero for the integral part and p + 1 for the nth decimal, if p is not equal either to 8 or 9, and unity in the contrary case. This number N does not belong to the set E because it differs from any number of this set, namely from the nth number by the nth digit. But N has been defined by a finite number of words. It should therefore belong to the set E. That is a contradiction.\n\nRichard never presented his paradox in another form, but meanwhile there exist several different versions, some of which being only very loosely connected to the original. For the sake of completeness they may be stated here.\n\n Other versions of Richard's Paradox \n\n(A) The version given in Principia Mathematica by Whitehead and Russell is similar to Richard's original version, alas not quite as exact. Here only the digit 9 is replaced by the digit 0, such that identities like 1.000... = 0.999... can spoil the result.\n\n(B) Berry's Paradox, first mentioned in the Principia Mathematica as fifth of seven paradoxes, is credited to Mr. G. G. Berry of the Bodleian Library. It uses the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables; in fact, in English it denotes 111,777. But \"the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables\" is itself a name consisting of eighteen syllables; hence the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables can be named in eighteen syllables, which is a contradiction\n\n(C) Berry's Paradox with letters instead of syllables is often related to the set of all natural numbers which can be defined by less than 100 (or any other large number) letters. As the natural numbers are a well-ordered set there must be the least number which cannot be defined by less than 100 letters. But this number was just defined by 65 letters including spaces.\n\n(D) König's Paradox was also published in 1905 by Julius König. All real numbers which can be defined by a finite number of words form a subset of the real numbers. If the real numbers can be well-ordered, then there must be a first real number (according to this order) which cannot be defined by a finite number of words. But the first real number which cannot be defined by a finite number of words has just been defined by a finite number of words.\n\n(E) The smallest natural number without interesting properties acquires an interesting property by this very lack of any interesting properties.\n\n(F) A loan of the Paradox of Grelling and Nelson. The number of all finite definitions is countable. In lexical order we obtain a sequence of definitions D1,  D2, D3,  ... Now, it may happen that a definition defines its own number. This would be the case if D1 read \"the smallest natural number\". It may happen, that a definition does not describe its own number. This would be the case if D2 read \"the smallest natural number\". Also the sentence \"this definition does not describe its number\" is a finite definition. Let it be Dn. Is n described by Dn. If yes, then no, and if no, then yes. The dilemma is irresolvable. (This version is described in more detail in another article, Richard's paradox.)\n\n Reactions to Richard's Paradox \n\nGeorg Cantor wrote in a letter to David Hilbert:\n\"Infinite definitions\" (i.e., definitions which cannot be done in finite time) are absurdities. If Königs statement was \"correct\", according to which all \"finitely definable\" real numbers form a collection of cardinal number , this would imply the countability of the whole continuum; but this is obviously wrong. The question is now what error the alleged proof of his wrong theorem is based upon. The error (which also appears in the note of a Mr. Richard in the last issue of the Acta mathematic, which Mr. Poincaré emphasizes in the last issue of the Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale) is, in my opinion, the following: It is assumed that the system {B} of notions B, which have to be used for the definition of individual numbers, is at most countably infinite. This assumption \"must be in error\" because otherwise we would have the wrong theorem: \"the continuum of numbers has cardinality \".\n\nHere Cantor is in error. Today we know that there are uncountably many real numbers without the possibility of a finite definition.\n\nErnst Zermelo comments Richard's argument:\n The notion \"finitely definable\" is not an absolute one but a relative one being always related to the \"language\" chosen. The conclusion according to which all finitely definable objects are countable is only valid in case that one and the same system of symbols is used; the question whether a single individual can be subject to a finite definition is void because to every thing an arbitrary name can be attached to.\n\nZermelo points to the reason why Richard's paradox fails. His last statement, however, is impossible to satisfy. A real number with infinitely many digits, which are not determined by some \"rule\", has an infinitely large contents of information. Such a number could only be identified by a short name if there were only one or few of them existing. If there exist uncountably many, as is the case, an identification is impossible.\n\n Papers and books by Jules Richard \n\nThèses présentées à la Faculté des sciences de Paris par M.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleinian_group",
    "text": "In mathematics, a Kleinian group is a discrete subgroup of PSL(2, C). The group PSL(2, C) of 2 by 2 complex  matrices of determinant 1 modulo its center has several natural representations: as conformal transformations of the Riemann sphere, and as orientation-preserving isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space H3, and as orientation preserving conformal  maps of the open unit ball B3 in R3 to itself. Therefore, a Kleinian group can be regarded as a discrete subgroup acting on one of these spaces.\nHistory\nThe theory of general Kleinian groups was founded by  and  , who named them  after Felix Klein. The special case of Schottky groups had been studied a few years earlier, in 1877, by Schottky.\n\nDefinitions\n\nBy considering the ball's boundary, a Kleinian group can also be defined as a subgroup Γ of PGL(2,C), the complex projective linear group, which acts by Möbius transformations on the Riemann sphere. Classically, a Kleinian group was required to act properly discontinuously on a non-empty open subset of the Riemann sphere, but modern usage allows any discrete subgroup.\n\nWhen Γ is isomorphic to the fundamental group  of a hyperbolic 3-manifold, then the quotient space H3/Γ becomes a Kleinian model of the manifold.  Many authors use the terms Kleinian model and Kleinian group interchangeably, letting the one stand for the other.\n\nDiscreteness implies points in B3 have finite stabilizers, and discrete orbits under the group Γ. But the orbit Γp of a point p will typically accumulate on the boundary of the closed ball .\n\nthumb|An Apollonian gasket is an example of a limit set of a Kleinian group The boundary of the closed ball is called the sphere at infinity, and is denoted . The set of accumulation points of Γp in  is called the limit set of Γ, and usually denoted . The complement  is called the domain of discontinuity or the ordinary set or the regular set. Ahlfors' finiteness theorem implies that if the group is finitely generated then  is a Riemann surface orbifold of finite type.\n\nThe unit ball B3 with its conformal structure is the Poincaré model of hyperbolic 3-space. When we think of it metrically, with metric \n\nit is a model of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space H3. The set of conformal self-maps of B3 becomes the set of isometries (i.e. distance-preserving maps) of H3 under this identification. Such maps restrict to conformal self-maps of , which are Möbius transformations. There are isomorphisms\n\nThe subgroups of these groups consisting of orientation-preserving transformations are all isomorphic to the projective matrix group: PSL(2,C) via the usual identification of the unit sphere with the complex projective line P1(C).\nVariations\n\nThere are some variations of the definition of a Kleinian group: sometimes \nKleinian groups are allowed to be subgroups of PSL(2, C).2 (PSL(2, C) extended by complex conjugations), in other words to have orientation reversing elements, and  sometimes they are assumed to be finitely generated, and sometimes they are required to act properly discontinuously on a non-empty open subset of the Riemann sphere.\n\nTypes\n\nA Kleinian group is said to be of finite type if its region of discontinuity has a finite number of orbits of components under the group action, and the quotient of each component by its stabilizer is a compact Riemann surface with finitely many points removed, and the covering is ramified at finitely many points.\nA Kleinian group is called finitely generated if it has a finite number of generators. The Ahlfors finiteness theorem says that such a group is of finite type.\nA Kleinian group Γ has finite covolume if H3/Γ has finite volume. Any Kleinian group of finite covolume is finitely generated.\nA Kleinian group is called geometrically finite if it has a fundamental polyhedron (in hyperbolic 3-space) with finitely many sides. Ahlfors showed that if the limit set is not the whole Riemann sphere then it has measure 0.\nA Kleinian group Γ is called arithmetic if it is commensurable with the group norm 1 elements of an order of  quaternion algebra A ramified at all real places  over a number field k with exactly one complex place. Arithmetic Kleinian groups have finite covolume.\nA Kleinian group Γ is called cocompact if H3/Γ is compact, or equivalently SL(2, C)/Γ is compact. Cocompact Kleinian groups have finite covolume.\nA Kleinian group is called topologically tame if it is finitely generated and its hyperbolic manifold is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary.\nA Kleinian group is called geometrically tame if its ends are either geometrically finite or simply degenerate .\nA Kleinian group is said to be of type 1 if the limit set is the whole Riemann sphere, and of type 2 otherwise.\n\nExamples\n\nBianchi groups\nA Bianchi group  is a Kleinian group of the form PSL(2, Od), where  is the ring of integers of the imaginary quadratic field  for d a positive square-free integer.\n\nElementary and reducible Kleinian groups\nA Kleinian group is called elementary if its limit set is finite, in which case the limit set has 0, 1, or 2 points. \nExamples of elementary Kleinian groups include finite Kleinian groups (with empty limit set) and infinite cyclic Kleinian groups.\n\nA Kleinian group is called reducible if all elements have a common fixed point on the Riemann sphere. Reducible Kleinian groups are elementary, but some elementary finite  Kleinian groups are not reducible.\n\nFuchsian groups\nAny Fuchsian group (a discrete subgroup of SL(2, R)) is a Kleinian group, and conversely any Kleinian group preserving the real line (in its action on the Riemann sphere) is a Fuchsian group. More generally, every Kleinian group preserving a circle or straight line in the Riemann sphere is conjugate to a Fuchsian group.\n\nKoebe groups\nA factor of a Kleinian group G is a subgroup H maximal subject to the following properties:\nH has a simply connected invariant component D\nA conjugate of an element h of H by a conformal bijection is parabolic or elliptic if and only if h is.\nAny parabolic element of G fixing a boundary point of D is in H.\nA Kleinian group is called a Koebe group if all its factors are elementary or Fuchsian.\n\nQuasi-Fuchsian groups\nthumb|right|Limit set of a quasifuchsian group\nA Kleinian group that preserves a Jordan curve is called a quasi-Fuchsian group. When the Jordan curve is a circle or a straight line these are just conjugate to Fuchsian groups under conformal transformations. Finitely generated quasi-Fuchsian groups are conjugate to Fuchsian groups under quasi-conformal transformations. The limit set is contained in the invariant Jordan curve, and it is equal to the Jordan curve the group is said to be of type one, and otherwise it is said to be of type 2.\n\nSchottky groups\nLet Ci be the boundary circles of a finite collection of disjoint closed disks. The group generated by inversion in each circle has limit set  a Cantor set, and the quotient H3/G is a mirror orbifold with underlying space a ball. It is double covered by a handlebody; the corresponding index 2 subgroup is a Kleinian group called a Schottky group.\n\nCrystallographic groups\nLet T be a periodic tessellation of hyperbolic 3-space. The group of symmetries of the tessellation is a Kleinian group.\n\nFundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds\nThe fundamental group of any oriented hyperbolic 3-manifold is a Kleinian group. There are many examples of these, such as the complement of a figure 8 knot or the Seifert–Weber space. Conversely if a Kleinian group has no nontrivial torsion elements then it is the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.\n\nDegenerate Kleinian groups\nA Kleinian group is called degenerate if it is not elementary and its limit set is simply connected. Such groups can be constructed by taking a suitable limit of quasi-Fuchsian groups such that one of the two components of the regular points contracts down to the empty set; these groups are called singly degenerate. If both components of the regular set contract down to the empty set, then the limit set becomes a space-filling curve and the group is called doubly degenerate. \nThe existence of degenerate Kleinian groups was first shown indirectly by , and the first explicit example was found by Jørgensen.  gave examples of doubly degenerate groups and space-filling curves associated to pseudo-Anosov maps.\n\nSee also\nAhlfors measure conjecture\nDensity theorem for Kleinian groups\nEnding lamination theorem\nTameness theorem (Marden's conjecture)\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nExternal links\n  A picture of the limit set of a quasi-Fuchsian group from .\n  A picture of the limit set of a Kleinian group from .

    "text": " \nThe Mathematical manuscripts of Karl Marx consist mostly of Karl Marx's attempts to understand the foundations of infinitesimal calculus, from around 1873–1883. A Russian edition edited by Sofya Yanovskaya  was eventually published  in 1968, and an English translation was published in 1983 . \n\nAccording to Hubert C. Kennedy, Marx \"[...] seems to have been unaware of the advances being made by continental mathematicians in the foundations of differential calculus, including the work of Cauchy.\" In the same text, Kennedy says \"While Marx's analysis of the derivative and differential had no immediate effect on the historical development of mathematics, Engels' claim that Marx made \"independent discoveries\" is certainly justified. Marx's operational definition of the differential anticipated 20th century developments in mathematics, and there is another aspect of the differential, that seems to have been seen by Marx, that has become a standard part of modern textbooks—the concept of the differential as the principal part of an increment.\", implying that Marx's apprehension and interpretation of calculus was far from short-sighted. This may have contributed to an interest in nonstandard analysis among Chinese mathematicians .\n\nReferences\n\n External links \n\nCategory:1968 books\nCategory:Academic works about mathematics\nCategory:Books published posthumously\nCategory:Books by Karl Marx\ncategory:dialectical materialism"

    "text": "Muntinlupa Science High School, known as Muntinlupa Science or MunSci, is a special science public high school in the City of Muntinlupa, Philippines that provides a technical and science curriculum that aims to prepare students for careers in science and technology, math, and communication arts.\n\nThe school admits about 200 freshmen out of 600 applicants a year, but in the school year 2008-2009 they added 40 students to be admitted, making it 240.\n\nHistory\nThe Division of City Schools of Muntinlupa, with local government officials, residents and students jointly initiated a request to the DECS for the establishment of a school. After the DECS approved the request on April 15, 1999, a Selection Admission Test was administered to 126 student applicants on April 26. The top 72 students composed the batch who were the first to graduate from what would eventually be known as Muntinlupa Science High School.\n\nOn June 1, 1998, the school was inaugurated in the presence of local government and division school officials, 72 students, their parents, and six teachers.\n\nAfter a year at Itaas Elementary School, a three-storey building at 999 Buendia St., Tunasan was inaugurated on June 4, 1999 by city officials headed by former Mayor Jaime R. Fresnedi and DSS Dr. Alma Bella O. Bautista; the DECS office was represented by Dr. Fe Hidalgo. A three-storey building housing the administration office, clinic, guidance counselor|guidance services, library, computer room and two first year classes stands with its back against Laguna de Bay.\n\nOn April 1, 2002, the school graduated its first batch of seniors who hold the distinction of having generated the high percentage of UPCAT passers at 64%. During this year under the efforts of Carmen Rodriguez, principal, the first batch of permanent teachers of Muntinlupa Science High School was approved by the Department Of Education. They were Paolo Bundoc (Math), Melody Gonzaga (PE), Cecilia Guevara (Filipino), Arlene Marcos (TLE), Enrico \"Bobby\" Obsequio (Math), Dory Tamayo (Math) and Edsel Umali (Araling Panlipunan).\n\nSections\nThere are 28 sections overall from Grade 7 to Grade 10 in MSHS for the School Year 2018 - 2019.

Every year level is given two science subjects: one regular and one elective. For the regular science, Grade 7 takes Integrated Science, which is an overview of the basic topics covered in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, and Astronomy; Grade 8 takes Biology; Grade 9 takes Chemistry; and seniors take Physics. Students also take elective sciences: Biotechnology for 8th graders, Consumer Chemistry for 9th graders, and Physical Science for seniors. The MSHS subject coordinator for Science is Ms. Webena Gerona.\n\nMathematics\nThe school departs from the basic curriculum followed by most schools and adheres to a more advanced curriculum in mathematics. As with science, students take one regular and one elective for mathematics. Grade 7 take Linear Algebra and Arithmetic for regular and Elementary Algebra for elective. Grade 8 cover Geometry for regular and Intermediate Algebra for elective. Grade 9 tackle Advanced Algebra for regular and Trigonometry for elective. Seniors study Advanced Algebra, Analytic Geometry, and Number Theory for regular and Calculus for elective. The MSHS subject coordinator for Mathematics is Ms. Girley Diquit\n\nEnglish\nThe 7th graders English course focuses more on grammar, composition writing and Philippine literature. Works of Filipino writers in English, as well as indigenous myths are discussed, with Amador Daguio’s Wedding Dance being the level’s main literary piece. The 8th graders study the literature of Asia and Africa, as well as advance topics in communication arts and grammar Ramayana of Valmiki is the piece for the grade 8 level. 8th graders are taught to be more analytic by studying pieces for criticism. 9th graders focus more on reading and comprehension using literary pieces from American and English literature, paying special attention to Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur and William Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Hamlet, and Romeo and Juliet. Seniors are taught English in real world applications, such as job interviews, plays, and literary criticisms. Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables and Edith Hamilton’s Mythology are the main pieces for literature. The subject coordinator for English is Ms. Reina Aladeza.\n\nFilipino\nThe Filipino program for the seventh grade students discuss the characteristics of the Filipino language, which includes orthography, phonemic and morphemic changes, and grammar lessons. Ang Ibong Adarna is the piece for literature for the freshmen. The eight grade students study different forms of text and focus more on composition writing. They take up Francisco Balagtas’ Florante at Laura. The ninth grade students study literary criticism with literary pieces taken from regions of the Philippines and a special topic for José Rizal’s Noli Me Tangere. Fourth year students step on advanced literary criticism of pieces in world literature translated in Filipino. They study Rizal’s El Filibusterismo. The subject coordinator for Filipino is Mr. Alex Marcellano.\n\nSocial Studies\nGrade 7 begin their social studies course with Geography and Asian Studies and what is happening on earth. Grade 8 study Anthropology and Asian History and Culture. Grade 9 take Elementary Economics in relation to Philippines’ economic status and the World Market. Seniors tackle Sociology and Contemporary Issues. The subject coordinator in Social Studies is Ms. Celine Calado.\n\nResearch\nSubject courses in Research are now offered in all grades. 9th graders are offered basic theoretic principles in research and Statistics. Students may specialize either in Biotechnology or Microbiology. Seniors are given advanced applied principles in research and Thesis Writing. Students are required to conduct their own research study and a defense is required at the end of their course.\n\nInformation and Communication Technology\nAll ICT classes are held in the school’s three ICT laboratories: the computer laboratory which is for basic computer processes and applications, the internet laboratory for web and engineering applications, and the electronics laboratory for the electronics and communications students. 7th graders study the history of computers, with specialization in basic Windows programs. Lessons in operating Microsoft Office programs are also offered. 8th graders study internet and related topics, such as HTML encoding and web page making. Java and Pascal programs are also studied along with Logic operations using different number bases. Seniors may either take Computer Engineering, where they are taught hardware maintenance and repair; Logic, for students interested in integrated and digital circuits which operate in the binary system; or Basic Electronics. Seniors take Electronics, where they learn the components and processes of an electronic circuit. They are required to build an electronic device and a defense follows at the end of their course.\n\nJournalism\nThis is only offered to 9th grade, and 10th grade students as an elective. Journalism is offered to 9th graders and seniors, for the basic principles, and for the field work and applications, respectively. Students produce the school’s official publication in Filipino, Ang Matyag. The same goes for the English journalism, with its official publication, The Monitor. English Journalism was handled by Roderick de Leon until 2014 and Filipino Journalism was handled by Cecilia Guevarra until 2015. The Filipino Journalism is now handled by Mr. Alex C. Marcellano while English Journalism is now spearheaded by Ms. Gemma Jereza.\n\nForeign Languages\nThe school offers classes in foreign languages to grade 9 and 10 levels as an elective. Students are offered classes in language in culture of Nihongo and French.\n\nGrade 9 students who chooses the elective Nihongo, will tackle the 3 Japanese alphabets which are Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji as well as study basic Japanese expressions.\n\nGrade 9 students who chooses the elective French, will study basic and a little of advance French and learn to communicate fluently in the language when the course is finished.\n\nTechnology and Livelihood Education\nBasic TLE education, which covers all areas of home economics and entrepreneurship, is offered to 7th and 8th grade students. The MSHS subject coordinator for TLE is Mr. Albert Manalo.\n\nValues Education\nAll year levels are taught lessons pertaining to values enrichment, without adhering to any particular Christian sect. Predominantly, all lessons are based on a Philosophical and Psychological standpoint.\n\nMusic and Arts\n7th grade music cover the Philippine music. 8th grade specialize in Asian music. while the 9th graders study history of world music, with special attention given to the history of western music. Seniors study modern music. Students may take elective classes in music such as chorale or choir and rondalla ensemble. The same coverage is followed for Arts.\n\nPhysical Education and Health\nStudents may enter physical education classes which specialize in a sport: basketball (men and women), volleyball (men and women), badminton, football (men and women), table tennis, and chess. Students may opt to enter an elective class for dance troupe. Health topics cover human health, population and drug education for all year levels.\n\nTechnical Writing\nThis course is offered to Grade 7 students. This subject focuses more in complex foundations of English. It focuses on parts of speech, references, and other parts of the English language.\n\nStudent activities\n\nThe Muntinlupa Science High School Chorale\nThe school's choir is Muntinlupa Science High School (MSHS) chorale. The chorale joined choir competitions like the Voices in Harmony (2006) and Ang Aming Munting Handog chorale festival where they achieved the Grand Champion spot on December 6, 2008. They took the first runner up spots in 2006 and 2007. They also joined MUSIKAPELLA where they won second runner up (2007 and 2008) and Best in Choice Piece (2008), Rotary Club Manila (2007) where they won first runner up, and SM malls singing makabayan choir competition where they were hailed Grand Champions.\n\nThe MSHS chorale took third place in the NAMCYA 2008 choir category making them one of the best youth choirs in the National Capital Region. In 2010 they become the champion in MCL show choir competition, Hallmark Music and Memories Chorale Competition and Voices In Harmony 2010. In 2012, they were hailed Grand Champion in the 1st Xinghai Prize International Choir Championships held in Guangzhou, China. Subsequently, they took the first place in Voices in Harmony 2012.\n\nMSHS Rondalla\nIn 2005, with the guidance of Ivy Rose B. Casiguran, the Rondalla Group was formed. Shierly Protacio of II - Evans was the first president.\n\nIn 2007, with the guidance of music teacher Shellah Y. Doniza, the MSHS Rondalla was established. Catherine de Guzman of III - Fahrenheit (2007–08) was the first to be elected as the president and helds the presidency for two consecutive years followed by Sarah Jane dela Cruz of IV - Priestley (2009–10), Kathleen Lopena of IV - Pascal (2010–11), Elsbeth Nacino of IV - Pasteur (2011–12), Angela Borlongan of IV - Pasteur (2012–13), and Ferdinand Bundoc of IV - Pythagoras (2013–14).\n\nThey participated in the 2007 NAMCYA Rondalla High School category and reached the regional level with the pieces Maynila (Obertura) and Bakas ng Kahapon held at the University of the Philippines - Diliman, competing with seven other rondalla groups in the National Capital Region. In December 2011, the group represented the Philippines in the International Children's Arts and Culture Festival held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Local and school occasions were attended by the group since its establishment. Despite of the young age of the group, they brought excellence and dignity in the alma mater. The ensemble is known for its members who arrange the pieces played by the group. They consist of banduria players, octavina players, laud players, guitarists, two bassists and a drummer.\n\nIn the school year 2013-2014, the ensemble will take their chance again to compete in the prestigious NAMCYA for the rondalla group category.\n\nClubs and Organizations\n\nSupreme Student Government\nThe Supreme Student Government or SSG is the highest governing student body in the campus. The officers were chosen by an election every year.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Science high schools in Metro Manila\nCategory:Schools in Muntinlupa"

    "title": "New Foundations",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Foundations",
    "text": "In mathematical logic, New Foundations (NF) is an axiomatic set theory, conceived by Willard Van Orman Quine as a simplification of the theory of types of Principia Mathematica. Quine first proposed NF in a 1937 article titled \"New Foundations for Mathematical Logic\"; hence the name. Much of this entry discusses NFU, an important variant of NF due to Jensen (1969) and exposited in Holmes (1998).Holmes, Randall, 1998. Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set. Academia-Bruylant. In 1940 and in a revision of 1951 Quine introduced an extension of NF sometimes called \"Mathematical Logic\" or \"ML\", that included proper classes  as well as sets.\n\nNew Foundations has a universal set, so it is a non-well founded set theory.Quine's New Foundations - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy That is to say, it is an axiomatic set theory that allows infinite descending chains of membership such as\n… xn ∈ xn-1 ∈ …x3 ∈ x2 ∈ x1. It avoids Russell's paradox by permitting only stratifiable formulae to be defined using the axiom (schema) of comprehension. For instance x ∈ y is a stratifiable formula, but x ∈ x is not (for details of how this works see below).\n\nThe type theory TST\nThe primitive predicates of Russellian unramified typed set theory (TST), a streamlined version of the theory of types, are equality () and membership (). TST has a linear hierarchy of types: type 0 consists of individuals otherwise undescribed. For each (meta-) natural number n, type n+1 objects are sets of type n objects; sets of type n have members of type n-1. Objects connected by identity must have the same type. The following two atomic formulas succinctly describe the typing rules:  and . (Quinean set theory seeks to eliminate the need for such superscripts.)\n\nThe axioms of TST are:\nExtensionality: sets of the same (positive) type with the same members are equal;\nAn axiom schema of comprehension, namely:\nIf  is a formula, then the set  exists.\n\nIn other words, given any formula , the formula  is an axiom where  represents the set  and is not free in .\n\nThis type theory is much less complicated than the one first set out in the Principia Mathematica, which included types for relations whose arguments were not necessarily all of the same type. In 1914, Norbert Wiener showed how to code the ordered pair as a set of sets, making it possible to eliminate relation types in favor of the linear hierarchy of sets described here.\n\n Quinean set theory\n\nAxioms and stratification\n\nThe well-formed formulas of New Foundations (NF) are the same as the well-formed formulas of TST, but with the type annotations erased. The axioms of NF are:\n\nExtensionality: Two objects with the same elements are the same object;\nA comprehension schema: All instances of TST Comprehension but with type indices dropped (and without introducing new identifications between variables).\n\nBy convention, NF's Comprehension schema is stated using the concept of stratified formula and making no direct reference to types. A formula  is said to be stratified if there exists a function f from pieces of syntax to the natural numbers, such that for any atomic subformula  of  we have f(y) = f(x) + 1, while for any atomic subformula  of , we have f(x) = f(y). Comprehension then becomes:\n exists for each stratified formula .\nEven the indirect reference to types implicit in the notion of stratification can be eliminated. Theodore Hailperin showed in 1944 that Comprehension is equivalent to a finite conjunction of its instances, so that NF can be finitely axiomatized without any reference to the notion of type.\n\nComprehension may seem to run afoul of problems similar to those in naive set theory, but this is not the case. For example, the existence of the impossible Russell class  is not an axiom of NF, because  cannot be stratified.\n\n Ordered pairs\nRelations and functions are defined in TST (and in NF and NFU) as sets of ordered pairs in the usual way. The usual definition of the ordered pair, first proposed by Kuratowski in 1921, has a serious drawback for NF and related theories: the resulting ordered pair necessarily has a type two higher than the type of its arguments (its left and right projections). Hence for purposes of determining stratification, a function is three types higher than the members of its field.\n\nIf one can define a pair in such a way that its type is the same type as that of its arguments (resulting in a type-level ordered pair), then a relation or function is merely one type higher than the type of the members of its field. Hence NF and related theories usually employ Quine's set-theoretic definition of the \nordered pair, which yields a type-level ordered pair. Holmes (1998) takes the ordered pair and its left and right projections as primitive. Fortunately, whether the ordered pair is type-level by definition or by assumption (i.e., taken as primitive) usually does not matter.\n\nThe existence of a type-level ordered pair implies Infinity, and NFU + Infinity interprets NFU + \"there is a type level ordered pair\" (they are not quite the same theory, but the differences are inessential). Conversely, NFU + Infinity + Choice proves the existence of a type-level ordered pair.\n\nAdmissibility of useful large sets\nNF (and NFU + Infinity + Choice, described below and known consistent) allow the construction of two kinds of sets that ZFC and its proper extensions disallow because they are \"too large\" (some set theories admit these entities under the heading of proper classes):\nThe universal set V. Because  is a stratified formula, the universal set V = {x | x=x} exists by Comprehension. An immediate consequence is that all sets have complements, and the entire set-theoretic universe under NF has a Boolean structure.\nCardinal and ordinal numbers. In NF (and TST), the set of all sets having n elements (the circularity here is only apparent) exists. Hence Frege's definition of the cardinal numbers works in NF and NFU: a cardinal number is an equivalence class of sets under the relation of equinumerosity: the sets A and B are equinumerous if there exists a bijection between them, in which case we write . Likewise, an ordinal number is an equivalence class of well-ordered sets.\n\nFinite axiomatizability\n\nNew Foundations can be finitely axiomatized.Fenton, Scott, 2015. New Foundations Explorer Home Page.\n\nCartesian closure\nThe category whose objects are the sets of NF and whose arrows are the functions between those sets is not Cartesian closedhttp://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/cartesian-closed.pdf; Cartesian closure can be a useful property for a category of sets. Since NF lacks Cartesian closure, not every function curries as one might intuitively expect, and NF is not a topos.\n\nThe consistency problem and related partial results\nThe outstanding problem with NF is that it is not yet verified to be relatively consistent to any mainstream mathematical system. NF disproves Choice, and so proves Infinity (Specker, 1953). But it is also known (Jensen, 1969) that allowing urelements (multiple distinct objects lacking members) yields NFU, a theory that is consistent relative to Peano arithmetic; if Infinity and Choice are added, the resulting theory has the same consistency strength as type theory with infinity or bounded Zermelo set theory. (NFU corresponds to a type theory TSTU, where type 0 has urelements, not just a single empty set.) There are other relatively consistent variants of NF.\n\nNFU is, roughly speaking, weaker than NF because in NF, the power set of the universe is the universe itself, while in NFU, the power set of the universe may be strictly smaller than the universe (the power set of the universe contains only sets, while the universe may contain urelements). In fact, this is necessarily the case in NFU+\"Choice\".\n\nSpecker has shown that NF is equiconsistent with TST + Amb, where Amb is the axiom scheme of typical ambiguity which asserts  for any formula ,  being the formula obtained by raising every type index in  by one. NF is also equiconsistent with the theory TST augmented with a \"type shifting automorphism\", an operation which raises type by one, mapping each type onto the next higher type, and preserves equality and membership relations (and which cannot be used in instances of Comprehension: it is external to the theory). The same results hold for various fragments of TST in relation to the corresponding fragments of NF.\n\nIn the same year (1969) that Jensen proved NFU consistent, Grishin proved  consistent.  is the fragment of NF with full extensionality (no urelements) and those instances of Comprehension which can be stratified using just three types. This theory is a very awkward medium for mathematics (although there have been attempts to alleviate this awkwardness), largely because there is no obvious definition for an ordered pair. Despite this awkwardness,  is very interesting because every infinite model of TST restricted to three types satisfies Amb. Hence for every such model there is a model of  with the same theory. This does not hold for four types:  is the same theory as NF, and we have no idea how to obtain a model of TST with four types in which Amb holds.\n\nIn 1983, Marcel Crabbé proved consistent a system he called NFI, whose axioms are unrestricted extensionality and those instances of Comprehension in which no variable is assigned a type higher than that of the set asserted to exist. This is a predicativity restriction, though NFI is not a predicative theory: it admits enough impredicativity to define the set of natural numbers (defined as the intersection of all inductive sets; note that the inductive sets quantified over are of the same type as the set of natural numbers being defined). Crabbé also discussed a subtheory of NFI, in which only parameters (free variables) are allowed to have the type of the set asserted to exist by an instance of Comprehension. He called the result \"predicative NF\" (NFP); it is, of course, doubtful whether any theory with a self-membered universe is truly predicative. Holmes has  shown that NFP has the same consistency strength as the predicative theory of types of Principia Mathematica without the Axiom of reducibility.\n\nSince 2015, several candidate proofs by Randall Holmes of the consistency of NF relative to ZF have been available both on arxiv and on the logician's home page. Holmes demonstrates the equiconsistency of a 'weird' variant of TST, namely TTTλ - 'tangled type theory with λ-types'  - with NF.  Holmes next shows that TTTλ is consistent relative to ZFA that is, ZF with atoms but without choice.  Holmes demonstrates this by constructing in ZFA+C that is ZF with atoms and choice, a class model of ZFA which includes 'tangled webs of cardinals' . The candidate proofs are all rather long, but no irrecoverable faults have been identified by the NF community so far.\n\nHow NF(U) avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes\nNF steers clear of the three well-known paradoxes of set theory. That NFU, a consistent (relative to Peano arithmetic) theory, also avoids the paradoxes may increase one's confidence in this fact.\n\nThe Russell paradox: An easy matter;  is not a stratified formula, so the existence of  is not asserted by any instance of Comprehension. Quine said that he constructed NF with this paradox uppermost in mind.\n\nCantor's paradox of the largest cardinal number exploits the application of Cantor's theorem to the universal set. Cantor's theorem says (given ZFC) that the power set  of any set  is larger than  (there can be no injection (one-to-one map) from  into ). Now of course there is an injection from  into , if  is the universal set! The resolution requires that one observes that  makes no sense in the theory of types: the type of  is one higher than the type of . The correctly typed version (which is a theorem in the theory of types for essentially the same reasons that the original form of Cantor's theorem works in ZF) is , where  is the set of one-element subsets of . The specific instance of this theorem of interest is : there are fewer one-element sets than sets (and so fewer one-element sets than general objects, if we are in NFU). The \"obvious\" bijection  from the universe to the one-element sets is not a set; it is not a set because its definition is unstratified. Note that in all known models of NFU it is the case that ; Choice allows one not only to prove that there are urelements but that there are many cardinals between  and .\n\nOne can now introduce some useful notions. A set  which satisfies the intuitively appealing  is said to be Cantorian: a Cantorian set satisfies the usual form of Cantor's theorem. A set  which satisfies the further condition that , the restriction of the singleton map to A, is a set is not only Cantorian set but strongly Cantorian.\n\nThe Burali-Forti paradox of the largest ordinal number goes as follows. Define (following naive set theory) the ordinals as equivalence classes of well-orderings under isomorphism. There is an obvious natural well-ordering on the ordinals; since it is a well-ordering it belongs to an ordinal . It is straightforward to prove (by transfinite induction) that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than a given ordinal  is  itself. But this means that  is the order type of the ordinals  and so is strictly less than the order type of all the ordinals — but the latter is, by definition,  itself!\n\nThe solution to the paradox in NF(U) starts with the observation that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than  is of a higher type than . Hence a type level ordered pair is two types higher than the type of its arguments and the usual Kuratowski ordered pair four types higher. For any order type , we can define an order type  one type higher: if , then  is the order type of the order . The triviality of the T operation is only a seeming one; it is easy to show that T is a strictly monotone (order preserving) operation on the ordinals.\n\nNow the lemma on order types may be restated in a stratified manner: the order type of the natural order on the ordinals  is  or \ndepending on which pair is used (we assume the type level pair hereinafter). From this one may deduce that the order type on the ordinals  is , and thus  . Hence the T operation is not a function; there cannot be a strictly monotone set map from ordinals to ordinals which sends an ordinal downward! Since T is monotone, we have , a \"descending sequence\" in the ordinals which cannot be a set.\n\nOne might assert that this result shows that no model of NF(U) is \"standard\", since the ordinals in any model of NFU are externally not well-ordered. One need not take a position on this, but can note that it is also a theorem of NFU that any set model of NFU has non-well-ordered \"ordinals\"; NFU does not conclude that the universe V is a model of NFU, despite V being a set, because the membership relation is not a set relation.\n\nFor a further development of mathematics in NFU, with a comparison to the development of the same in ZFC, see implementation of mathematics in set theory.\n\nThe system ML (Mathematical Logic) \n\nML is an extension of NF that includes proper classes as well as sets.\nThe set theory of the 1940 first edition of Quine's Mathematical Logic married NF to the proper classes of NBG set theory, and included an axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension for proper classes. However  proved that the system presented in Mathematical Logic was subject to the Burali-Forti paradox. This result does not apply to NF.  showed how to amend Quine's axioms for ML so as to avoid this problem, and Quine included the resulting axiomatization in the 1951 second and final edition of Mathematical Logic.\n\nWang proved that if NF is consistent then so is the revised ML, and also showed that the revised ML can prove the consistency of NF, that is that NF and  the revised ML are equiconsistent.\n\nModels of NFU\nThere is a fairly simple method for producing models of NFU in bulk. Using well-known techniques of model theory, one can construct a nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory (nothing nearly as strong as full ZFC is needed for the basic technique) on which there is an external automorphism j (not a set of the model) which moves a rank  of the cumulative hierarchy of sets. We may suppose without loss of generality that . We talk about the automorphism moving the rank rather than the ordinal because we do not want to assume that every ordinal in the model is the index of a rank.\n\nThe domain of the model of NFU will be the nonstandard rank . The membership relation of the model of NFU will be\n\nIt may now be proved that this actually is a model of NFU. Let  be a stratified formula in the language of NFU. Choose an assignment of types to all variables in the formula which witnesses the fact that it is stratified. Choose a natural number N greater than all types assigned to variables by this stratification.\n\nExpand the formula  into a formula  in the language of the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory with automorphism j using the definition of membership in the model of NFU. Application of any power of j to both sides of an equation or membership statement preserves its truth value because j is an automorphism. Make such an application to each atomic formula in  in such a way that each variable x assigned type i occurs with exactly  applications of j. This is possible thanks to the form of the atomic membership statements derived from NFU membership statements, and to the formula being stratified. Each quantified sentence  can be converted to the form  (and similarly for existential quantifiers). Carry out this transformation everywhere and obtain a formula  in which j is never applied to a bound variable.\n\nChoose any free variable y in  assigned type i. Apply  uniformly to the entire formula to obtain a formula  in which y appears without any application of j. Now  exists (because j appears applied only to free variables and constants), belongs to , and contains exactly those y which satisfy the original formula\n in the model of NFU.  has this extension in the model of NFU (the application of j corrects for the different definition of membership in the model of NFU). This establishes that Stratified Comprehension holds in the model of NFU.\n\nTo see that weak Extensionality holds is straightforward: each nonempty element of  inherits a unique extension from the nonstandard model, the empty set inherits its usual extension as well, and all other objects are urelements.\n\nThe basic idea is that the automorphism j codes the \"power set\"  of our \"universe\"  into its externally isomorphic copy  inside our \"universe.\" The remaining objects not coding subsets of the universe are treated as urelements.\n\nIf  is a natural number n, one gets a model of NFU which claims that the universe is finite (it is externally infinite, of course). If  is infinite and the Choice holds in the nonstandard model of ZFC, one obtains a model of NFU + Infinity + Choice.\n\n Self-sufficiency of mathematical foundations in NFU \nFor philosophical reasons, it is important to note that it is not necessary to work in ZFC or any related system to carry out this proof. A common argument against the use of NFU as a foundation for mathematics is that the reasons for relying on it have to do with the intuition that ZFC is correct. It is sufficient to accept TST (in fact TSTU). In outline: take the type theory TSTU (allowing urelements in each positive type) as a metatheory and consider the theory of set models of TSTU in TSTU (these models will be sequences of sets  (all of the same type in the metatheory) with embeddings of each  into  coding embeddings of the power set of  into  in a type-respecting manner). Given an embedding of  into  (identifying elements of the base \"type\" with subsets of the base type), embeddings may be defined from each \"type\" into its successor in a natural way. This can be generalized to transfinite sequences  with care.\n\nNote that the construction of such sequences of sets is limited by the size of the type in which they are being constructed; this prevents TSTU from proving its own consistency (TSTU + Infinity can prove the consistency of TSTU; to prove the consistency of TSTU+Infinity one needs a type containing a set of cardinality , which cannot be proved to exist in TSTU+Infinity without stronger assumptions). Now the same results of model theory can be used to build a model of NFU and verify that it is a model of NFU in much the same way, with the 's being used in place of  in the usual construction. The final move is to observe that since NFU is consistent, we can drop the use of absolute types in our metatheory, bootstrapping the metatheory from TSTU to NFU.\n\n Facts about the automorphism j \nThe automorphism j of a model of this kind is closely related to certain natural operations in NFU. For example, if W is a well-ordering in the nonstandard model (we suppose here that we use Kuratowski pairs so that the coding of functions in the two theories will agree to some extent) which is also a well-ordering in NFU (all well-orderings of NFU are well-orderings in the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory, but not vice versa, due to the formation of urelements in the construction of the model), and W has type α in NFU, then j(W) will be a well-ordering of type T(α) in NFU.\n\nIn fact, j is coded by a function in the model of NFU. The function in the nonstandard model which sends the singleton of any element of  to its sole element, becomes in NFU a function which sends each singleton {x}, where x is any object in the universe, to j(x). Call this function Endo and let it have the following properties: Endo is an injection from the set of singletons into the set of sets, with the property that Endo( {x} ) = {Endo( {y} ) | y∈x} for each set x. This function can define a type level \"membership\" relation on the universe, one reproducing the membership relation of the original nonstandard model.\n\nStrong axioms of infinity\nIn this section the effect is considered of adding various \"strong axioms of infinity\" to our usual base theory, NFU + Infinity + Choice. This base theory, known consistent, has the same strength as TST + Infinity, or Zermelo set theory with Separation restricted to bounded formulas (Mac Lane set theory).\n\nOne can add to this base theory strong axioms of infinity familiar from the ZFC context, such as \"there exists an inaccessible cardinal,\" but it is more natural to consider assertions about Cantorian and strongly Cantorian sets. Such assertions not only bring into being large cardinals of the usual sorts, but strengthen the theory on its own terms.\n\nThe weakest of the usual strong principles is:\n\nRosser's Axiom of Counting. The set of natural numbers is a strongly Cantorian set.\n\nTo see how natural numbers are defined in NFU, see set-theoretic definition of natural numbers. The original form of this axiom given by Rosser was \"the set {m|1≤m≤n} has n members\", for each natural number n. This intuitively obvious assertion is unstratified: what is provable in NFU is \"the set {m|1≤m≤n} has  members\" (where the T operation on cardinals is defined by ; this raises the type of a cardinal by one). For any cardinal number (including natural numbers) to assert  is equivalent to asserting that the sets A of that cardinality are Cantorian (by a usual abuse of language, we refer to such cardinals as \"Cantorian cardinals\"). It is straightforward to show that the assertion that each natural number is Cantorian is equivalent to the assertion that the set of all natural numbers is strongly Cantorian.\n\nCounting is consistent with NFU, but increases its consistency strength noticeably; not, as one would expect, in the area of arithmetic, but in higher set theory. NFU + Infinity proves that each  exists, but not that  exists; NFU + Counting (easily) proves Infinity, and further proves the existence of  for each n, but not the existence of . (See beth numbers).\n\nCounting implies immediately that one does not need to assign types to variables restricted to the set  of natural numbers for purposes of stratification; it is a theorem that the power set of a strongly Cantorian set is strongly Cantorian, so it is further not necessary to assign types to variables restricted to any iterated power set of the natural numbers, or to such familiar sets as the set of real numbers, the set of functions from reals to reals, and so forth. The set-theoretical strength of Counting is less important in practice than the convenience of not having to annotate variables known to have natural number values (or related kinds of values) with singleton brackets, or to apply the T operation in order to get stratified set definitions.\n\nCounting implies Infinity; each of the axioms below needs to be adjoined to NFU + Infinity to get the effect of strong variants of Infinity; Ali Enayat has investigated the strength of some of these axioms in models of NFU + \"the universe is finite\".\n\nA model of the kind constructed above satisfies Counting just in case the automorphism j fixes all natural numbers in the underlying nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory.\n\nThe next strong axiom we consider is the\n\nAxiom of strongly Cantorian separation: For any strongly Cantorian set A and any formula  (not necessarily stratified!) the set {x∈A|φ} exists.\n\nImmediate consequences include Mathematical Induction for unstratified conditions (which is not a consequence of Counting; many but not all unstratified instances of induction on the natural numbers follow from Counting).\n\nThis axiom is surprisingly strong. Unpublished work of Robert Solovay shows that the consistency strength of the theory NFU* = NFU + Counting + Strongly Cantorian Separation is the same as that of Zermelo set theory +  Replacement.\n\nThis axiom holds in a model of the kind constructed above (with Choice) if the ordinals which are fixed by j and dominate only ordinals fixed by j in the underlying nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory are standard, and the power set of any such ordinal in the model is also standard. This condition is sufficient but not necessary.\n\nNext is\n\nAxiom of Cantorian Sets: Every Cantorian set is strongly Cantorian.\n\nThis very simple and appealing assertion is extremely strong. Solovay has shown the precise equivalence of the consistency strength of the theory NFUA = NFU + Infinity + Cantorian Sets with that of ZFC + a schema asserting the existence of an n-Mahlo cardinal for each concrete natural number n. Ali Enayat has shown that the theory of Cantorian equivalence classes of well-founded extensional relations (which gives a natural picture of an initial segment of the cumulative hierarchy of ZFC) interprets the extension of ZFC with n-Mahlo cardinals directly. A permutation technique can be applied to a model of this theory to give a model in which the hereditarily strongly Cantorian sets with the usual membership relation model the strong extension of ZFC.\n\nThis axiom holds in a model of the kind constructed above (with Choice) just in case the ordinals fixed by j in the underlying nonstandard model of ZFC are an initial (proper class) segment of the ordinals of the model.\n\nNext consider the\n\nAxiom of Cantorian Separation: For any Cantorian set A and any formula  (not necessarily stratified!) the set {x∈A|φ} exists.\n\nThis combines the effect of the two preceding axioms and is actually even stronger (precisely how is not known). Unstratified mathematical induction enables proving that there are n-Mahlo cardinals for every n, given Cantorian Sets, which gives an extension of ZFC that is even stronger than the previous one, which only asserts that there are n-Mahlos for each concrete natural number (leaving open the possibility of nonstandard counterexamples).\n\nThis axiom will hold in a model of the kind described above if every ordinal fixed by j is standard, and every power set of an ordinal fixed by j is also standard in the underlying model of ZFC. Again, this condition is sufficient but not necessary.\n\nAn ordinal is said to be Cantorian if it is fixed by T, and strongly Cantorian if it dominates only Cantorian ordinals (this implies that it is itself Cantorian). In models of the kind constructed above, Cantorian ordinals of NFU correspond to ordinals fixed by j (they are not the same objects because different definitions of ordinal numbers are used in the two theories).\n\nEqual in strength to Cantorian Sets is the\n\nAxiom of Large Ordinals: For each non-Cantorian ordinal , there is a natural number n such that .\n\nRecall that  is the order type of the natural order on all ordinals. This only implies Cantorian Sets if we have Choice (but is at that level of consistency strength in any case). It is remarkable that one can even define : this is the nth term  of any finite sequence of ordinals s of length n such that ,  for each appropriate i. This definition is completely unstratified. The uniqueness of  can be proved (for those n for which it exists) and a certain amount of common-sense reasoning about this notion can be carried out, enough to show that Large Ordinals implies Cantorian Sets in the presence of Choice. In spite of the knotty formal statement of this axiom, it is a very natural assumption, amounting to making the action of T on the ordinals as simple as possible.\n\nA model of the kind constructed above will satisfy Large Ordinals, if the ordinals moved by j are exactly the ordinals which dominate some  in the underlying nonstandard model of ZFC.\n\nAxiom of Small Ordinals: For any formula φ, there is a set A such that the elements of A which are strongly Cantorian ordinals are exactly the strongly Cantorian ordinals such that φ.\n\nSolovay has shown the precise equivalence in consistency strength of NFUB = NFU + Infinity + Cantorian Sets + Small Ordinals with Morse–Kelley set theory plus the assertion that the proper class ordinal (the class of all ordinals) is a weakly compact cardinal. This is very strong indeed! Moreover, NFUB-, which is NFUB with Cantorian Sets omitted, is easily seen to have the same strength as NFUB.\n\nA model of the kind constructed above will satisfy this axiom if every collection of ordinals fixed by j is the intersection of some set of ordinals with the ordinals fixed by j, in the underlying nonstandard model of ZFC.\n\nEven stronger is the theory NFUM = NFU + Infinity + Large Ordinals + Small Ordinals. This is equivalent to Morse–Kelley set theory with a predicate on the classes which is a κ-complete nonprincipal ultrafilter on the proper class ordinal κ; in effect, this is Morse–Kelley set theory + \"the proper class ordinal is a measurable cardinal\"!\n\nThe technical details here are not the main point, which is that reasonable and natural (in the context of NFU) assertions turn out to be equivalent in power to very strong axioms of infinity in the ZFC context. This fact is related to the correlation between the existence of models of NFU, described above and satisfying these axioms, and the existence of models of ZFC with automorphisms having special properties.\n\nSee also\nAlternative set theory\nAxiomatic set theory\nImplementation of mathematics in set theory\nPositive set theory\nSet-theoretic definition of natural numbers\n\n Notes \n\n References \n\n With discussion by Quine.\n\n \n\nQuine, W.

    "title": "Ordinal collapsing function",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_collapsing_function",
    "text": "In mathematical logic and set theory, an ordinal collapsing function (or projection function) is a technique for defining (notations for) certain recursive large countable ordinals, whose principle is to give names to certain ordinals much larger than the one being defined, perhaps even large cardinals (though they can be replaced with recursively large ordinals at the cost of extra technical difficulty), and then “collapse” them down to a system of notations for the sought-after ordinal.  For this reason, ordinal collapsing functions are described as an impredicative manner of naming ordinals.\n\nThe details of the definition of ordinal collapsing functions vary, and get more complicated as greater ordinals are being defined, but the typical idea is that whenever the notation system “runs out of fuel” and cannot name a certain ordinal, a much larger ordinal is brought “from above” to give a name to that critical point.  An example of how this works will be detailed below, for an ordinal collapsing function defining the Bachmann–Howard ordinal (i.e., defining a system of notations up to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal).\n\nThe use and definition of ordinal collapsing functions is inextricably intertwined with the theory of ordinal analysis, since the large countable ordinals defined and denoted by a given collapse are used to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of certain formal systems, typicallyRathjen, 1995 (Bull. Symbolic Logic)Kahle, 2002 (Synthese) subsystems of analysis (such as those seen in the light of reverse mathematics), extensions of Kripke–Platek set theory, Bishop-style systems of constructive mathematics or Martin-Löf-style systems of intuitionistic type theory.\n\nOrdinal collapsing functions are typically denoted using some variation of either the Greek letter  (psi) or  (theta).\n\n An example leading up to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal \nThe choice of the ordinal collapsing function given as example below imitates greatly the system introduced by BuchholzBuchholz, 1986 (Ann. Pure Appl. Logic) but is limited to collapsing one cardinal for clarity of exposition.  More on the relation between this example and Buchholz's system will be said below.\n\n Definition \nLet  stand for the first uncountable ordinal , or, in fact, any ordinal which is (an -number and) guaranteed to be greater than all the countable ordinals which will be constructed (for example, the Church–Kleene ordinal is adequate for our purposes; but we will work with  because it allows the convenient use of the word countable in the definitions).\n\nWe define a function  (which will be non-decreasing and continuous), taking an arbitrary ordinal  to a countable ordinal , recursively on , as follows:\n\nAssume  has been defined for all , and we wish to define .\n\nLet  be the set of ordinals generated starting from , ,  and  by recursively applying the following functions: ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation and the function , i.e., the restriction of  to ordinals .  (Formally, we define  and inductively  for all natural numbers  and we let  be the union of the  for all .)\n\nThen  is defined as the smallest ordinal not belonging to .\n\nIn a more concise (although more obscure) way:\n is the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from , ,  and  using sums, products, exponentials, and the  function itself (to previously constructed ordinals less than ).\n\nHere is an attempt to explain the motivation for the definition of  in intuitive terms: since the usual operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation are not sufficient to designate ordinals very far, we attempt to systematically create new names for ordinals by taking the first one which does not have a name yet, and whenever we run out of names, rather than invent them in an ad hoc fashion or using diagonal schemes, we seek them in the ordinals far beyond the ones we are constructing (beyond , that is); so we give names to uncountable ordinals and, since in the end the list of names is necessarily countable,  will “collapse” them to countable ordinals.\n\n Computation of values of  \nTo clarify how the function  is able to produce notations for certain ordinals, we now compute its first values.\n\n Predicative start \nFirst consider .  It contains ordinals , , , , , , , , , , , ,  and so on.  It also contains such ordinals as , , , .  The first ordinal which it does not contain is  (which is the limit of , ,  and so on — less than  by assumption).  The upper bound of the ordinals it contains is  (the limit of , ,  and so on), but that is not so important.  This shows that .\n\nSimilarly,  contains the ordinals which can be formed from , , ,  and this time also , using addition, multiplication and exponentiation.  This contains all the ordinals up to  but not the latter, so .  In this manner, we prove that  inductively on : the proof works, however, only as long as .  We therefore have:\n\n for all , where  is the smallest fixed point of .\n\n(Here, the  functions are the Veblen functions defined starting with .)\n\nNow  but  is no larger, since  cannot be constructed using finite applications of  and thus never belongs to a  set for , and the function  remains “stuck” at  for some time:\n\n for all .\n\n First impredicative values \nAgain, .  However, when we come to computing , something has changed: since  was (“artificially”) added to all the , we are permitted to take the value  in the process.  So  contains all ordinals which can be built from , , , , the  function up to  and this time also  itself, using addition, multiplication and exponentiation.  The smallest ordinal not in  is  (the smallest -number after ).\n\nWe say that the definition  and the next values of the function  such as  are impredicative because they use ordinals (here, ) greater than the ones which are being defined (here, ).\n\n Values of  up to the Feferman–Schütte ordinal \nThe fact that  remains true for all  (note, in particular, that : but since now the ordinal  has been constructed there is nothing to prevent from going beyond this).  However, at  (the first fixed point of  beyond ), the construction stops again, because  cannot be constructed from smaller ordinals and  by finitely applying the  function.  So we have .\n\nThe same reasoning shows that  for all , where  enumerates the fixed points of  and  is the first fixed point of .  We then have .\n\nAgain, we can see that  for some time: this remains true until the first fixed point  of , which is the Feferman–Schütte ordinal.  Thus,  is the Feferman–Schütte ordinal.\n\n Beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal \nWe have  for all  where  is the next fixed point of .  So, if  enumerates the fixed points in question (which can also be noted  using the many-valued Veblen functions) we have , until the first fixed point  of the  itself, which will be  (and the first fixed point  of the  functions will be ).  In this manner:\n  is the Ackermann ordinal (the range of the notation  defined predicatively),\n  is the “small” Veblen ordinal (the range of the notations  predicatively using finitely many variables),\n  is the “large” Veblen ordinal (the range of the notations  predicatively using transfinitely-but-predicatively-many variables),\n the limit  of , , , etc., is the Bachmann–Howard ordinal: after this our function  is constant, and we can go no further with the definition we have given.\n\n Ordinal notations up to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal \nWe now explain more systematically how the  function defines notations for ordinals up to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.\n\n A note about base representations \nRecall that if  is an ordinal which is a power of  (for example  itself, or , or ), any ordinal  can be uniquely expressed in the form , where  is a natural number,  are non-zero ordinals less than , and  are ordinal numbers (we allow ).  This “base  representation” is an obvious generalization of the Cantor normal form (which is the case ).  Of course, it may quite well be that the expression is uninteresting, i.e., , but in any other case the  must all be less than ; it may also be the case that the expression is trivial (i.e., , in which case  and ).\n\nIf  is an ordinal less than , then its base  representation has coefficients  (by definition) and exponents  (because of the assumption ): hence one can rewrite these exponents in base  and repeat the operation until the process terminates (any decreasing sequence of ordinals is finite).  We call the resulting expression the iterated base  representation of  and the various coefficients involved (including as exponents) the pieces of the representation (they are all ), or, for short, the -pieces of .\n\n Some properties of  \n The function  is non-decreasing and continuous (this is more or less obvious from its definition).\n If  with  then necessarily .  Indeed, no ordinal  with  can belong to  (otherwise its image by , which is  would belong to  — impossible); so  is closed by everything under which  is the closure, so they are equal.\n Any value  taken by  is an -number (i.e., a fixed point of ).  Indeed, if it were not, then by writing it in Cantor normal form, it could be expressed using sums, products and exponentiation from elements less than it, hence in , so it would be in , a contradiction.\n Lemma: Assume  is an -number and  an ordinal such that  for all : then the -pieces (defined above) of any element of  are less than .  Indeed, let  be the set of ordinals all of whose -pieces are  less than .  Then  is closed under addition, multiplication and exponentiation (because  is an -number, so ordinals less than it are closed under addition, multiplication and exponentiation).  And  also contains every  for  by assumption, and it  contains , , , .  So , which was to be shown.\n Under the hypothesis of the previous lemma,  (indeed, the lemma shows that ).\n Any -number less than some element in the range of  is itself in the range of  (that is,  omits no -number).  Indeed: if  is an -number not greater than the range of , let  be the least upper bound of the  such that : then by the above we have , but  would contradict the fact that  is the least upper bound — so .\n Whenever , the set  consists exactly of those ordinals  (less than ) all of whose -pieces are less than .  Indeed, we know that all ordinals less than , hence all ordinals (less than ) whose -pieces are less than , are in .  Conversely, if we assume  for all  (in other words if  is the least possible with ), the lemma gives the desired property.  On the other hand, if  for some , then we have already remarked  and we can replace  by the least possible with .\n\n The ordinal notation \nUsing the facts above, we can define a (canonical) ordinal notation for every  less than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.  We do this by induction on .\n\nIf  is less than , we use the iterated Cantor normal form of .  Otherwise, there exists a largest -number  less or equal to  (this is because the set of -numbers is closed): if  then by induction we have defined a notation for  and the base  representation of  gives one for , so we are finished.\n\nIt remains to deal with the case where  is an -number: we have argued that, in this case, we can write  for some (possibly uncountable) ordinal : let  be the greatest possible such ordinal (which exists since  is continuous).  We use the iterated base  representation of : it remains to show that every piece of this representation is less than  (so we have already defined a notation for it).  If this is not the case then, by the properties we have shown,  does not contain ; but then  (they are closed under the same operations, since the value of  at  can never be taken), so , contradicting the maximality of .\n\nNote: Actually, we have defined canonical notations not just for ordinals below the Bachmann–Howard ordinal but also for certain uncountable ordinals, namely those whose -pieces are less than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal (viz.: write them in iterated base  representation and use the canonical representation for every piece).  This canonical notation is used for arguments of the  function (which may be uncountable).\n\n Examples \nFor ordinals less than , the canonical ordinal notation defined coincides with the iterated Cantor normal form (by definition).\n\nFor ordinals less than , the notation coincides with iterated base  notation (the pieces being themselves written in iterated Cantor normal form): e.g.,  will be written , or, more accurately, .  For ordinals less than , we similarly write in iterated base  and then write the pieces in iterated base  (and write the pieces of that in iterated Cantor normal form): so  is written , or, more accurately, .  Thus, up to , we always use the largest possible -number base which gives a non-trivial representation.\n\nBeyond this, we may need to express ordinals beyond : this is always done in iterated -base, and the pieces themselves need to be expressed using the largest possible -number base which gives a non-trivial representation.\n\nNote that while  is equal to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal, this is not a “canonical notation” in the sense we have defined (canonical notations are defined only for ordinals less than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal).\n\n Conditions for canonicalness \nThe notations thus defined have the property that whenever they nest  functions, the arguments of the “inner”  function are always less than those of the “outer” one (this is a consequence of the fact that the -pieces of , where  is the largest possible such that  for some -number , are all less than , as we have shown above).  For example,  does not occur as a notation: it is a well-defined expression (and it is equal to  since  is constant between  and ), but it is not a notation produced by the inductive algorithm we have outlined.\n\nCanonicalness can be checked recursively: an expression is canonical if and only if it is either the iterated Cantor normal form of an ordinal less than , or an iterated base  representation all of whose pieces are canonical, for some  where  is itself written in iterated base  representation all of whose pieces are canonical and less than .  The order is checked by lexicographic verification at all levels (keeping in mind that  is greater than any expression obtained by , and for canonical values the greater  always trumps the lesser or even arbitrary sums, products and exponentials of the lesser).\n\nFor example,  is a canonical notation for an ordinal which is less than the Feferman–Schütte ordinal: it can be written using the Veblen functions as .\n\nConcerning the order, one might point out that  (the Feferman–Schütte ordinal) is much more than  (because  is greater than  of anything), and  is itself much more than  (because  is greater than , so any sum-product-or-exponential expression involving  and smaller value will remain less than ).  In fact,  is already less than .\n\n Standard sequences for ordinal notations \n\nTo witness the fact that we have defined notations for ordinals below the Bachmann–Howard ordinal (which are all of countable cofinality), we might define standard sequences converging to any one of them (provided it is a limit ordinal, of course).  Actually we will define canonical sequences for certain uncountable ordinals, too, namely the uncountable ordinals of countable cofinality (if we are to hope to define a sequence converging to them…) which are representable (that is, all of whose -pieces are less than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal).\n\nThe following rules are more or less obvious, except for the last:\n First, get rid of the (iterated) base  representations: to define a standard sequence converging to , where  is either  or  (or , but see below):\n if  is zero then  and there is nothing to be done;\n if  is zero and  is successor, then  is successor and there is nothing to be done;\n if  is limit, take the standard sequence converging to  and replace  in the expression by the elements of that sequence;\n if  is successor and  is limit, rewrite the last term  as  and replace the exponent  in the last term by the elements of the fundamental sequence converging to it;\n if  is successor and  is also, rewrite the last term  as  and replace the last  in this expression by the elements of the fundamental sequence converging to it.\n If  is , then take the obvious , , , … as the fundamental sequence for .\n If  then take as fundamental sequence for  the sequence , , …\n If  then take as fundamental sequence for  the sequence , , …\n If  where  is a limit ordinal of countable cofinality, define the standard sequence for  to be obtained by applying  to the standard sequence for  (recall that  is continuous and increasing, here).\n It remains to handle the case where  with  an ordinal of uncountable cofinality (e.g.,  itself).  Obviously it doesn't make sense to define a sequence converging to  in this case; however, what we can define is a sequence converging to some  with countable cofinality and such that  is constant between  and .  This  will be the first fixed point of a certain (continuous and non-decreasing) function .  To find it, apply the same rules (from the base  representation of ) as to find the canonical sequence of , except that whenever a sequence converging to  is called for (something which cannot exist), replace the  in question, in the expression of , by a  (where  is a variable) and perform a repeated iteration (starting from , say) of the function : this gives a sequence , , … tending to , and the canonical sequence for  is , , … If we let the th element (starting at ) of the fundamental sequence for  be denoted as , then we can state this more clearly using recursion. Using this notation, we can see that  quite easily. We can define the rest of the sequence using recursion: . (The examples below should make this clearer.)\n\nHere are some examples for the last (and most interesting) case:\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , …  This indeed converges to  after which  is constant until .\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , …  This indeed converges to the value of  at  after which  is constant until .\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , …  This converges to the value of  at .\n The canonical sequence for  is , , …  This converges to the value of  at .\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , …  This converges to the value of  at .\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , …  This converges to the value of  at .\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , …  This converges to the value of  at .\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , …\n\nHere are some examples of the other cases:\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , , …\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , , …\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , , …\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , …\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , , …\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , , …\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , , …\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , … (this is derived from the fundamental sequence for ).\n The canonical sequence for  is: , , … (this is derived from the fundamental sequence for , which was given above).\n\nEven though the Bachmann–Howard ordinal  itself has no canonical notation, it is also useful to define a canonical sequence for it: this is , , …\n\n A terminating process \nStart with any ordinal less than or equal to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal, and repeat the following process so long as it is not zero:\n if the ordinal is a successor, subtract one (that is, replace it with its predecessor),\n if it is a limit, replace it by some element of the canonical sequence defined for it.\nThen it is true that this process always terminates (as any decreasing sequence of ordinals is finite); however, like (but even more so than for) the hydra game:\n it can take a very long time to terminate,\n the proof of termination may be out of reach of certain weak systems of arithmetic.\n\nTo give some flavor of what the process feels like, here are some steps of it: starting from  (the small Veblen ordinal), we might go down to , from there down to , then  then  then  then  then  then  then  and so on.  It appears as though the expressions are getting more and more complicated whereas, in fact, the ordinals always decrease.\n\nConcerning the first statement, one could introduce, for any ordinal  less or equal to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal , the integer function  which counts the number of steps of the process before termination if one always selects the 'th element from the canonical sequence (this function satisfies the identity ).  Then  can be a very fast growing function: already  is essentially , the function  is comparable with the Ackermann function , and  is comparable with the Goodstein function. If we instead make a function that satisfies the identity , so the index of the function increases it is applied, then we create a much faster growing function:  is already comparable to the Goodstein function, and  is comparable to the TREE function.\n\nConcerning the second statement, a precise version is given by ordinal analysis: for example, Kripke–Platek set theory can proveRathjen, 2005 (Fischbachau slides) that the process terminates for any given  less than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal, but it cannot do this uniformly, i.e., it cannot prove the termination starting from the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.  Some theories like Peano arithmetic are limited by much smaller ordinals ( in the case of Peano arithmetic).\n\n Variations on the example \n\n Making the function less powerful \nIt is instructive (although not exactly useful) to make  less powerful.\n\nIf we alter the definition of  above to omit exponentiation from the repertoire from which  is constructed, then we get  (as this is the smallest ordinal which cannot be constructed from ,  and  using addition and multiplication only), then  and similarly ,  until we come to a fixed point which is then our .  We then have  and so on until .  Since multiplication of 's is permitted, we can still form  and  and so on, but our construction ends there as there is no way to get at or beyond : so the range of this weakened system of notation is  (the value of  is the same in our weaker system as in our original system, except that now we cannot go beyond it).  This does not even go as far as the Feferman–Schütte ordinal.\n\nIf we alter the definition of  yet some more to allow only addition as a primitive for construction, we get  and  and so on until  and still .  This time,  and so on until  and similarly .  But this time we can go no further: since we can only add 's, the range of our system is .\n\nIn both cases, we find that the limitation on the weakened  function comes not so much from the operations allowed on the countable ordinals as on the uncountable ordinals we allow ourselves to denote.\n\n Going beyond the Bachmann–Howard ordinal \nWe know that  is the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.  The reason why  is no larger, with our definitions, is that there is no notation for  (it does not belong to  for any , it is always the least upper bound of it).  One could try to add the  function (or the Veblen functions of so-many-variables) to the allowed primitives beyond addition, multiplication and exponentiation, but that does not get us very far.  To create more systematic notations for countable ordinals, we need more systematic notations for uncountable ordinals: we cannot use the  function itself because it only yields countable ordinals (e.g.,  is, , certainly not ), so the idea is to mimic its definition as follows:\n\nLet  be the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from all countable ordinals,  and  using sums, products, exponentials, and the  function itself (to previously constructed ordinals less than ).\n\nHere,  is a new ordinal guaranteed to be greater than all the ordinals which will be constructed using : again, letting  and  works.\n\nFor example, , and more generally  for all countable ordinals and even beyond ( and ): this holds up to the first fixed point  beyond  of the  function, which is the limit of ,  and so forth.  Beyond this, we have  and this remains true until : exactly as was the case for , we have  and .\n\nThe  function gives us a system of notations (assuming we can somehow write down all countable ordinals!) for the uncountable ordinals below , which is the limit of ,  and so forth.\n\nNow we can reinject these notations in the original  function, modified as follows:\n is the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from , , ,  and  using sums, products, exponentials, the  function, and the  function itself (to previously constructed ordinals less than ).\n\nThis modified function  coincides with the previous one up to (and including)  — which is the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.  But now we can get beyond this, and  is  (the next -number after the Bachmann–Howard ordinal).  We have made our system doubly impredicative: to create notations for countable ordinals we use notations for certain ordinals between  and  which are themselves defined using certain ordinals beyond .\n\nA variation on this scheme, which makes little difference when using just two (or finitely many) collapsing functions, but becomes important for infinitely many of them, is to define\n is the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from , , ,  and  using sums, products, exponentials, and the  and  function (to previously constructed ordinals less than ).\ni.e., allow the use of  only for arguments less than  itself.  With this definition, we must write  instead of  (although it is still also equal to , of course, but it is now constant until ).  This change is inessential because, intuitively speaking, the  function collapses the nameable ordinals beyond  below the latter so it matters little whether  is invoked directly on the ordinals beyond  or on their image by .  But it makes it possible to define  and  by simultaneous (rather than “downward”) induction, and this is important if we are to use infinitely many collapsing functions.\n\nIndeed, there is no reason to stop at two levels: using  new cardinals in this way, , we get a system essentially equivalent to that introduced by Buchholz, the inessential difference being that since Buchholz uses  ordinals from the start, he does not need to allow multiplication or exponentiation; also, Buchholz does not introduce the numbers  or  in the system as they will also be produced by the  functions: this makes the entire scheme much more elegant and more concise to define, albeit more difficult to understand.  This system is also sensibly equivalent to the earlier (and much more difficult to grasp) “ordinal diagrams” of TakeutiTakeuti, 1967 (Ann. Math.) and  functions of Feferman: their range is the same (, which could be called the Takeuti-Feferman–Buchholz ordinal, and which describes the strength of -comprehension plus bar induction).\n\n A \"normal\" variant \nMost definitions of ordinal collapsing functions found in the recent literature differ from the ones we have given in one technical but important way which makes them technically more convenient although intuitively less transparent.  We now explain this.\n\nThe following definition (by induction on ) is completely equivalent to that of the function  above:\n\nLet  be the set of ordinals generated starting from , , ,  and all ordinals less than  by recursively applying the following functions: ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and the function .  Then  is defined as the smallest ordinal  such that .\n\n(This is equivalent, because if  is the smallest ordinal not in , which is how we originally defined , then it is also the smallest ordinal not in , and furthermore the properties we described of  imply that no ordinal between  inclusive and  exclusive belongs to .)\n\nWe can now make a change to the definition which makes it subtly different:\n\nLet  be the set of ordinals generated starting from , , ,  and all ordinals less than  by recursively applying the following functions: ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and the function .  Then  is defined as the smallest ordinal  such that  and .\n\nThe first values of  coincide with those of : namely, for all  where , we have  because the additional clause  is always satisfied.  But at this point the functions start to differ: while the function  gets “stuck” at  for all , the function  satisfies  because the new condition  imposes .  On the other hand, we still have  (because  for all  so the extra condition does not come in play).  Note in particular that , unlike , is not monotonic, nor is it continuous.\n\nDespite these changes, the  function also defines a system of ordinal notations up to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal: the notations, and the conditions for canonicalness, are slightly different (for example,  for all  less than the common value ).\n\n Collapsing large cardinals \nAs noted in the introduction, the use and definition of ordinal collapsing functions is strongly connected with the theory of ordinal analysis, so the collapse of this or that large cardinal must be mentioned simultaneously with the theory for which it provides a proof-theoretic analysis.\n\n Gerhard Jäger and Wolfram PohlersJäger & Pohlers, 1983 (Bayer. Akad. Wiss. Math.-Natur. Kl. Sitzungsber.) described the collapse of an inaccessible cardinal to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of Kripke–Platek set theory augmented by the recursive inaccessibility of the class of ordinals (KPi), which is also proof-theoretically equivalent to -comprehension plus bar induction.  Roughly speaking, this collapse can be obtained by adding the  function itself to the list of constructions to which the  collapsing system applies.\n Michael RathjenRathjen, 1991 (Arch. Math. Logic) then described the collapse of a Mahlo cardinal to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of Kripke–Platek set theory augmented by the recursive mahloness of the class of ordinals (KPM).\n RathjenRathjen, 1994 (Ann. Pure Appl. Logic) later described the collapse of a weakly compact cardinal to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of Kripke–Platek set theory augmented by certain reflection principles (concentrating on the case of -reflection).  Very roughly speaking, this proceeds by introducing the first cardinal  which is -hyper-Mahlo and adding the  function itself to the collapsing system.\n Rathjen has begunRathjen, 2005 (Arch. Math. Logic) the investigation of the collapse of yet larger cardinals, with the ultimate goal of achieving an ordinal analysis of -comprehension (which is proof-theoretically equivalent to the augmentation of Kripke–Platek by -separation).\n\n Notes \n\n References \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  (slides of a talk given at Fischbachau)\n\nCategory:Ordinal numbers"

    "text": "In mathematical logic, predicate functor logic (PFL) is one of several ways to express first-order logic (also known as predicate logic) by purely algebraic means, i.e., without quantified variables. PFL employs a small number of algebraic devices called predicate functors (or predicate modifiers) that operate on terms to yield terms. PFL is mostly the invention of the logician and philosopher Willard Quine.\n\nMotivation\nThe source for this section, as well as for much of this entry, is Quine (1976). Quine proposed PFL as a way of algebraizing first-order logic in a manner analogous to how Boolean algebra algebraizes propositional logic. He designed PFL to have exactly the expressive power of first-order logic with identity. Hence the metamathematics of PFL are exactly those of first-order logic with no interpreted predicate letters: both logics are sound, complete, and undecidable. Most work Quine published on logic and mathematics in the last 30 years of his life touched on PFL in some way.\n\nQuine took \"functor\" from the writings of his friend Rudolf Carnap, the first to employ it in philosophy and mathematical logic, and defined it as follows:\n\"The word functor, grammatical in import but logical in habitat... is a sign that attaches to one or more expressions of given grammatical kind(s) to produce an expression of a given grammatical kind.\" (Quine 1982: 129)\n\nWays other than PFL to algebraize first-order logic include:\nCylindric algebra by Alfred Tarski and his American students. The simplified cylindric algebra proposed in Bernays (1959) led Quine to write the paper containing the first use of the phrase \"predicate functor\";\nThe polyadic algebra of Paul Halmos. By virtue of its economical primitives and axioms, this algebra most resembles PFL;\nRelation algebra algebraizes the fragment of first-order logic consisting of formulas having no atomic formula lying in the scope of more than three quantifiers. That fragment suffices, however, for Peano arithmetic and the axiomatic set theory ZFC; hence relation algebra, unlike PFL, is incompletable. Most work on relation algebra since about 1920 has been by Tarski and his American students. The power of relation algebra did not become manifest until the monograph Tarski and Givant (1987), published after the three important papers bearing on PFL, namely Bacon (1985), Kuhn (1983), and Quine (1976);\nCombinatory logic builds on combinators, higher order functions whose domain is another combinator or function, and whose range is yet another combinator. Hence combinatory logic goes beyond first-order logic by having the expressive power of set theory, which makes combinatory logic vulnerable to paradoxes. A predicate functor, on the other hand, simply maps predicates (also called terms) into predicates.\nPFL is arguably the simplest of these formalisms, yet also the one about which the least has been written.\n\nQuine had a lifelong fascination with combinatory logic, attested to by his (1976) and his introduction to the translation in Van Heijenoort (1967) of the paper by the Russian logician Moses Schönfinkel founding combinatory logic. When Quine began working on PFL in earnest, in 1959, combinatory logic was commonly deemed a failure for the following reasons:\n Until Dana Scott began writing on the model theory of combinatory logic in the late 1960s, almost only Haskell Curry, his students, and Robert Feys in Belgium worked on that logic;\nSatisfactory axiomatic formulations of combinatory logic were slow in coming. In the 1930s, some formulations of combinatory logic were found to be inconsistent. Curry also discovered the Curry paradox, peculiar to combinatory logic;\nThe lambda calculus, with the same expressive power as combinatory logic, was seen as a superior formalism.\n\nKuhn's formalization\nThe PFL syntax, primitives, and axioms described in this section are largely Kuhn's (1983). The semantics of the functors are Quine's (1982). The rest of this entry incorporates some terminology from Bacon (1985).\n\nSyntax\nAn atomic term is an upper case Latin letter, I and S excepted, followed by a numerical superscript called its degree, or by concatenated lower case variables, collectively known as an argument list. The degree of a term conveys the same information as the number of variables following a predicate letter. An atomic term of degree 0 denotes a Boolean variable or a truth value. The degree of I is invariably 2 and so is not indicated.\n\nThe \"combinatory\" (the word is Quine's) predicate functors, all monadic and peculiar to PFL, are Inv, inv, ∃, +, and p. A term is either an atomic term, or constructed by the following recursive rule. If τ is a term, then Invτ, invτ, ∃τ, +τ, and pτ are terms. A functor with a superscript n, n a natural number > 1, denotes n consecutive applications (iterations) of that functor.\n\nA formula is either a term or defined by the recursive rule: if α and β are formulas, then αβ and ~(α) are likewise formulas. Hence \"~\" is another monadic functor, and concatenation is the sole dyadic predicate functor. Quine called these functors \"alethic.\" The natural interpretation of \"~\" is negation; that of concatenation is any connective that, when combined with negation, forms a functionally complete set of connectives. Quine's preferred functionally complete set was conjunction and negation. Thus concatenated terms are taken as conjoined. The notation + is Bacon's (1985); all other notation is Quine's (1976; 1982). The alethic part of PFL is identical to the Boolean term schemata of Quine (1982).\n\nAs is well known, the two alethic functors could be replaced by a single dyadic functor with the following syntax and semantics: if α and β are formulas, then (αβ) is a formula whose semantics are \"not (α and/or β)\" (see NAND and NOR).\n\nAxioms and semantics\nQuine set out neither axiomatization nor proof procedure for PFL. The following axiomatization of PFL, one of two proposed in Kuhn (1983), is concise and easy to describe, but makes extensive use of free variables and so does not do full justice to the spirit of PFL. Kuhn gives another axiomatization dispensing with free variables, but that is harder to describe and that makes extensive use of defined functors. Kuhn proved both of his PFL axiomatizations sound and complete.\n\nThis section is built around the primitive predicate functors and a few defined ones. The alethic functors can be axiomatized by any set of axioms for sentential logic whose primitives are negation and one of ∧ or ∨. Equivalently, all tautologies of sentential logic can be taken as axioms.\n\nQuine's (1982) semantics for each predicate functor are stated below in terms of abstraction (set builder notation), followed by either the relevant axiom from Kuhn (1983), or a definition from Quine (1976). The notation  denotes the set of n-tuples satisfying the atomic formula \n\nIdentity, I, is defined as:\n\nIdentity is reflexive (Ixx), symmetric (Ixy→Iyx), transitive ( (Ixy∧Iyz) → Ixz), and obeys the substitution property:\n\nPadding, +, adds a variable to the left of any argument list.\n\nCropping, ∃, erases the leftmost variable in any argument list.\n\nCropping enables two useful defined functors:\n Reflection, S:\n\nS generalizes the notion of reflexivity to all terms of any finite degree greater than 2. N.B: S should not be confused with the primitive combinator S of combinatory logic.\nCartesian product, ;\n \nHere only, Quine adopted an infix notation, because this infix notation for Cartesian product is very well established in mathematics. Cartesian product allows restating conjunction as follows:\n\nReorder the concatenated argument list so as to shift a pair of duplicate variables to the far left, then invoke S to eliminate the duplication. Repeating this as many times as required results in an argument list of length max(m,n).\n\nThe next three functors enable reordering argument lists at will.  \nMajor inversion, Inv, rotates the variables in an argument list to the right, so that the last variable becomes the first.\n\nMinor inversion, inv, swaps the first two variables in an argument list.\n\nPermutation, p, rotates the second through last variables in an argument list to the left, so that the second variable becomes the last.\n\nGiven an argument list consisting of n variables, p implicitly treats the last n-1 variables like a bicycle chain, with each variable constituting a link in the chain. One application of p advances the chain by one link. k consecutive applications of p to Fn moves the k+1 variable to the second argument position in F.\n\nWhen n=2, Inv and inv merely interchange x1 and x2. When n=1, they have no effect. Hence p has no effect when n<3.\n\nKuhn (1983) takes Major inversion and Minor inversion as primitive. The notation p in Kuhn corresponds to inv; he has no analog to Permutation and hence has no axioms for it. If, following Quine (1976), p is taken as primitive, Inv and inv can be defined as nontrivial combinations of +, ∃, and iterated p.\n\nThe following table summarizes how the functors affect the degrees of their arguments.\n\nRules\nAll instances of a predicate letter may be replaced by another predicate letter of the same degree, without affecting validity. The rules are:\n Modus ponens;\n Let α and β be PFL formulas in which  does not appear. Then if  is a PFL theorem, then  is likewise a PFL theorem.\n\nSome useful results\nInstead of axiomatizing PFL, Quine (1976) proposed the following conjectures as candidate axioms.\n\nn-1 consecutive iterations of p restores the status quo ante:\n\n+ and ∃ annihilate each other:\n\nNegation distributes over +, ∃, and p:\n\n+ and p distributes over conjunction:\n\nIdentity has the interesting implication:\n\nQuine also conjectured the rule: If  is a PFL theorem, then so are   and .\n\nBacon's work\nBacon (1985) takes the conditional, negation, Identity, Padding, and Major and Minor inversion as primitive, and Cropping as defined. Employing terminology and notation differing somewhat from the above, Bacon (1985) sets out two formulations of PFL:\n A natural deduction formulation in the style of Frederick Fitch. Bacon proves this formulation sound and complete in full detail.\nAn axiomatic formulation which Bacon asserts, but does not prove, equivalent to the preceding one. Some of these axioms are simply Quine conjectures restated in Bacon's notation.\n\nBacon also:\nDiscusses the relation of PFL to the term logic of Sommers (1982), and argues that recasting PFL using a syntax proposed in Lockwood's appendix to Sommers, should make PFL easier to \"read, use, and teach\";\nTouches on the group theoretic structure of Inv and inv;\nMentions that sentential logic, monadic predicate logic, the modal logic S5, and the Boolean logic of (un)permuted relations, are all fragments of PFL.\n\nFrom first-order logic to PFL\nThe following algorithm is adapted from Quine (1976: 300-2). Given a closed formula of first-order logic, first do the following:\n Attach a numerical subscript to every predicate letter, stating its degree;\n Translate all universal quantifiers into existential quantifiers and negation;\n Restate all atomic formulas of the form x=y as Ixy.\n\nNow apply the following algorithm to the preceding result:\n\n1. Translate the matrices of the most deeply nested quantifiers into disjunctive normal form, consisting of disjuncts of conjuncts of terms, negating atomic terms as required. The resulting subformula contains only negation, conjunction, disjunction, and existential quantification.\n\n2. Distribute the existential quantifiers over the disjuncts in the matrix using the rule of passage (Quine 1982: 119):\n\n3. Replace conjunction by Cartesian product, by invoking the fact:\n\n4. Concatenate the argument lists of all atomic terms, and move the concatenated list to the far right of the subformula.\n\n5. Use Inv and inv to move all instances of the quantified variable (call it y) to the left of the argument list.\n\n6. Invoke S as many times as required to eliminate all but the last instance of y. Eliminate y by prefixing the subformula with one instance of ∃.\n\n7. Repeat (1)-(6) until all quantified variables have been eliminated. Eliminate any disjunctions falling within the scope of a quantifier by invoking the equivalence:\n\nThe reverse translation, from PFL to first-order logic, is discussed in Quine (1976: 302-4).\n\nThe canonical foundation of mathematics is axiomatic set theory, with a background logic consisting of first-order logic with identity, with a universe of discourse consisting entirely of sets. There is a single predicate letter of degree 2, interpreted as set membership. The PFL translation of the canonical axiomatic set theory ZFC is not difficult, as no ZFC axiom requires more than 6 quantified variables.Metamath axioms.\n\nSee also\nalgebraic logic\ncombinatory logic\ncylindric algebra\nrelation algebra\nterm logic\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\nBacon, John, 1985, \"The completeness of a predicate-functor logic,\" Journal of Symbolic Logic 50: 903-26.\nPaul Bernays, 1959, \"Uber eine naturliche Erweiterung des Relationenkalkuls\" in Heyting, A., ed., Constructivity in Mathematics.

    "text": "Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) is an amplification technique (conceptually like PCR but not involving nucleotides) to multiply misfolded prions originally developed by Soto and colleagues.Saborio, G.P., Permanne, B. and Soto, C. (2001) Sensitive detection of pathological prion protein by cyclic amplification of protein misfolding.  Nature, 411, 810-813. It is a test for spongiform encephalopathies like BSE.\n\nTechnique\nThe technique initially incubates a small amount of abnormal prion with an excess of normal protein, so that some conversion takes place. The growing chain of misfolded protein is then blasted with ultrasound, breaking it down into smaller chains and so rapidly increasing the amount of abnormal protein available to cause conversions.Soto, C., Saborio, G.P. and Anderes, L. (2002) Cyclic amplification of protein misfolding: application to prion- related disorders and beyond.  Trends Neurosci., 25, 390-394. By repeating the cycle, the mass of normal protein is rapidly changed into misfolded prion (termed PrPSc).\n\nDevelopment\nPMCA was originally developed to, in vitro, mimic prion replication with a similar efficiency to the in vivo process, but with accelerated kinetics. PMCA is conceptually analogous to DNA amplification by PCR. In both systems a template grows at the expense of a substrate in a cyclic reaction, combining growing and multiplication of the template units.\n\nReplication\nPMCA has been applied to replicate the misfolded protein from diverse species.Soto, C., Anderes, L., Suardi, S., Cardone, F., Castilla, J., Frossard, M.J., Peano, S., Saá, P., Limido, L., Carbonatto, M., Ironside, J., Torres, J.M., Pocchiari, M. and Tagliavini, F.

(2007) Efficient in vitro amplification of chronic wasting disease PrPRES.  J.Virol., 81, 9605-9608. The newly generated protein exhibits the same biochemical, biological, and structural properties as brain-derived PrPSc and strikingly it is infectious to wild type animals, producing a disease with similar characteristics as the illness produced by brain-isolated prions.Castilla, J., Saá, P., Hetz, C. and Soto, C. (2005) In vitro generation of infectious scrapie prions.  Cell, 121, 195-206.\n\nAutomation\nThe technology has been automated, leading to a dramatic increase in the efficiency of amplification. Indeed, one round of PMCA cycling results in a 2500-fold increase in sensitivity of detection over western blotting, whereas 2 and 7 rounds of successive PMCA cyclings result in 6 million- and 3 billion-fold increases in sensitivity of detection over western blotting, a technique widely used in BSE surveillance in several countries.Saa, P., Castilla, J. and Soto, C. (2006) Ultra-efficient replication of infectious prions by automated protein misfolding cyclic amplification.  J.Biol.Chem., 281, 35245-35252.\n\nSensitivity\nIt has been shown that PMCA is capable of detecting as little as a single molecule of oligomeric infectious PrPSc. PMCA possesses the ability to generate millions infectious units, starting with the equivalent to one PrPSc oligomer; well below the infectivity threshold.  This data demonstrates that PMCA has a similar power of amplification as PCR techniques used to amplify DNA. It opens a great promise for development of a highly sensitive detection of PrPSc, and for understanding the molecular basis of prion replication. Indeed, PMCA has been used by various groups to PrPSc in blood of animals experimentally infected with prions during both the symptomaticCastilla, J., Saa, P. and Soto, C.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_machine",
    "text": "In computer science, random-access machine (RAM) is an abstract machine in the general class of register machines. The RAM is very similar to the counter machine but with the added capability of 'indirect addressing' of its registers. Like the counter machine the RAM has its instructions in the finite-state portion of the machine (the so-called Harvard architecture).\n\nThe RAM's equivalent of the universal Turing machinewith its program in the registers as well as its datais called the random-access stored-program machine or RASP. It is an example of the so-called von Neumann architecture and is closest to the common notion of computer.\n\nTogether with the Turing machine and counter-machine models, the RAM and RASP models are used for computational complexity analysis. Van Emde Boas (1990) calls these three plus the pointer machine \"sequential machine\" models, to distinguish them from \"parallel random-access machine\" models.\n\nIntroduction to the model \nThe concept of a random-access machine (RAM) starts with the simplest model of all, the so-called counter machine model. Two additions move it away from the counter machine, however. The first enhances the machine with the convenience of indirect addressing; the second moves the model toward the more conventional accumulator-based computer with the addition of one or more auxiliary (dedicated) registers, the most common of which is called \"the accumulator\".\n\n Formal definition \nA random-access machine (RAM) is an abstract computational-machine model identical to a multiple-register counter machine with the addition of indirect addressing. At the discretion of an instruction from its finite state machine's TABLE, the machine derives a \"target\" register's address either (i) directly from the instruction itself, or (ii) indirectly from the contents (e.g. number, label) of the \"pointer\" register specified in the instruction.\n\nBy definition: A register is a location with both an address (a unique, distinguishable designation/locator equivalent to a natural number) and a contenta single natural number. For precision we will use the quasi-formal symbolism from Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) to specify a register, its contents, and an operation on a register:\n [r] means \"the contents of register with address r\". The label \"r\" here is a \"variable\" that can be filled with a natural number or a letter (e.g. \"A\") or a name.\n → means \"copy/deposit into\", or \"replaces\", but without destruction of the source\n Example: [3] +1 → 3; means \"The contents of source register with address \"3\", plus 1, is put into destination register with address \"3\" (here source and destination are the same place). If [3]=37, that is, the contents of register 3 is the number \"37\", then 37+1 = 38 will be put into register 3.\n\n Example: [3] → 5; means \"The contents of source register with address \"3\" is put into destination register with address \"5\". If [3]=38, that is, the contents of register 3 is the number 38, then this number will be put into register 5.  The contents of register 3 are not disturbed by this operation, so [3] continues to be 38, now the same as [5].\n\nDefinition: A direct instruction is one that specifies in the instruction itself the address of the source or destination register whose contents will be the subject of the instruction.\nDefinition: An indirect instruction is one that specifies a \"pointer register\", the contents of which is the address of a \"target\" register. The target register can be either a source or a destination (the various COPY instructions provide examples of this). A register can address itself indirectly.\nFor want of a standard/convention this article will specify \"direct/indirect\", abbreviated as \"d/i\", as a parameter (or parameters) in the instruction:Example: COPY ( d, A, i, N ) means directly d get the source register's address (register \"A\") from the instruction itself but indirectly i get the destination address from pointer-register N. Suppose [N]=3, then register 3 is the destination and the instruction will do the following: [A] → 3.Definition: The contents of source register is used by the instruction. The source register's address can be specified either (i) directly by the instruction, or (ii) indirectly by the pointer register specified by the instruction.\n\nDefinition: The contents of the pointer register is the address of the \"target\" register.\n\nDefinition: The contents of the pointer register points to the target registerthe \"target\" may be either a source or a destination register.\n\nDefinition: The destination register is where the instruction deposits its result. The source register's address can be specified either (i) directly by the instruction, or (ii) indirectly by the pointer register specified by the instruction. The source and destination registers can be one\n\n Refresher: The counter-machine model Melzak (1961) provides an easy visualization of a counter machine: its \"registers\" are holes in the ground, and these holes hold pebbles. Per an instruction, into and out of these holes \"the computer\" (person or machine) adds (INCrements) or removes (DECrements) a single pebble. As needed, additional pebbles come from, and excess pebbles go back into, an infinite supply; if the hole is too small to accommodate the pebbles the \"computer\" digs the hole bigger.Minsky (1961) and Hopcroft-Ullman 1979 (p. 171) offer the visualization of a multi-tape Turing machine with as many left-ended tapes as \"registers\". Each tape's length is unbounded to the right, and every square is blank except for the left end, which is marked. The distance of a tape's \"head\" from its left end, measured in numbers of tape-squares, represents the natural number in \"the register\". To DECrement the count of squares the tape head moves left; INCrement it moves right. There is no need to print or erase marks on the tape; the only conditional instructions are to check to see if the head is at the left end, by testing a left-end mark with a \"Jump-if-marked instruction\".The following instruction \"mnemonics\" e.g. \"CLR (r)\" are arbitrary; no standard exists.The register machine has, for a memory external to its finite-state machinean unbounded (cf: footnote|countable and unbounded) collection of discrete and uniquely labelled locations with unbounded capacity, called \"registers\". These registers hold only natural numbers (zero and the positive integers). Per a list of sequential instructions in the finite state machine's TABLE, a few (e.g. 2) types of primitive operations operate on the contents of these \"registers\". Finally, a conditional-expression in the form of an IF-THEN-ELSE is available to test the contents of one or two registers and \"branch/jump\" the finite state machine out of the default instruction-sequence.\n\nBase model 1: The model closest to Minsky's (1961) visualization and to Lambek (1961):\n{ INCrement contents of register r, DECrement contents of register r, IF contents of register r is Zero THEN Jump to instruction Iz ELSE continue to next instruction }:\n\n Instruction Mnemonic Action on register(s) \"r\" Action on finite state machine's Instruction Register, IR INCrement INC ( r ) [r] + 1 → r [IR] + 1 → IR DECrement DEC ( r ) [r] - 1 → r [IR] + 1 → IR Jump if Zero JZ ( r, z )  IF [r] = 0 THEN z → IR  ELSE [IR] + 1 → IR Halt H  [IR]  → IR\n\nBase model 2: The \"successor\" model (named after the successor function of the Peano axioms):\n{ INCrement the contents of register r, CLeaR the contents of register r, IF contents of register rj Equals the contents of register rk THEN Jump to instruction Iz ELSE goto to next instruction }\n\n Instruction Mnemonic Action on register(s) \"r\" Action on finite state machine's Instruction Register, IR CLeaR CLR ( r ) 0 → r [IR] + 1 → IR INCrement INC ( r ) [r] + 1 → r [IR] + 1 → IR Jump if Equal JE (r1, r2, z)  IF [r1] = [r2] THEN z → IR  ELSE [IR] + 1 → IR Halt H  [IR]  → IR\n\nBase model 3: Used by Elgot-Robinson (1964) in their investigation of bounded and unbounded RASPsthe \"successor\" model with COPY in the place of CLEAR:\n{ INCrement the contents of register r, COPY the contents of register rj to register rk, IF contents of register rj Equals the contents of register rk then Jump to instruction Iz ELSE goto to next instruction }\n\n Instruction Mnemonic Action on register(s) \"r\" Action on finite state machine's Instruction Register, IR COPY COPY (r1, r2) [r1] → r2 [IR] + 1 → IR INCrement INC ( r ) [r] + 1 → r [IR] + 1 → IR Jump if Equal JE (r1, r2, z)  IF [r1] = [r2] THEN z → IR  ELSE [IR] + 1 → IR Halt H  [IR]  → IR\n\nCreating \"convenience instructions\" from the base sets\nThe three base sets 1, 2, or 3 above are equivalent in the sense that one can create the instructions of one set using the instructions of another set (an interesting exercise: a hint from Minsky (1967)declare a reserved register e.g. call it \"0\" (or Z for \"zero\" or E for \"erase\") to contain the number 0). The choice of model will depend on which an author finds easiest to use in a demonstration, or a proof, etc.\n\nMoreover, from base sets 1, 2, or 3 we can create any of the primitive recursive functions ( cf Minsky (1967), Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) ). (How to cast the net wider to capture the total and partial mu recursive functions will be discussed in context of indirect addressing). However, building the primitive recursive functions is difficult because the instruction sets are so ... primitive (tiny). One solution is to expand a particular set with \"convenience instructions\" from another set:These will not be subroutines in the conventional sense but rather blocks of instructions created from the base set and given a mnemonic. In a formal sense, to use these blocks we need to either (i) \"expand\" them into their base-instruction equivalentsthey will require the use of temporary or \"auxiliary\" registers so the model must take this into account, or (ii) design our machines/models with the instructions 'built in'.Example: Base set 1. To create CLR (r) use the block of instructions to count down register r to zero. Observe the use of the hint mentioned above:\n CLR (r) =equiv\n loop: JZ (r, exit)\n DEC (r)\n JZ (0, loop)\n exit: etc.\n\nAgain, all of this is for convenience only; none of this increases the model's intrinsic power.\n\nFor example: the most expanded set would include each unique instruction from the three sets, plus unconditional jump J (z) i.e.:\n { CLR (r), DEC (r), INC (r), CPY ( rs, rd ), JZ (r, z), JE ( rj, rk, z ), J(z) }\n\nMost authors pick one or the other of the conditional jumps, e.g. Shepherdson-Sturgis (1963) use the above set minus JE (to be perfectly accurate they use JNZJump if Not Zero in place of JZ; yet another possible convenience instruction).\n\n The \"indirect\" operation \n\n Example of indirect addressing \nIn our daily lives the notion of an \"indirect operation\" is not unusual.\nExample: A treasure hunt.\nAt location \"Tom_&_Becky's_cave_in_pirate_chest\" will be where we can find a map directing us to \"the treasure\":\n(1) We go to location \"Tom_&_Becky's_cave...\" and dig around until we find a wooden box\n(2) Inside the box is a map to the location of the treasure: \"under_Thatcher's_front_porch\"\n(3) We go to location \"under_Thatcher's_front_porch\", jackhammer away the concrete, and discover \"the treasure\": a sack of rusty door-knobs.\n\nIndirection specifies a location identified as the pirate chest in \"Tom_&_Becky's_cave...\" that acts as a pointer to any other location (including itself): its contents (the treasure map) provides the \"address\" of the target location\n\"under_Thatcher's_front_porch\" where the real action is occurring.\n\nWhy the need for an indirect operation: Two major problems with the counter-machine model\nIn the following one must remember that these models are abstract models with two fundamental differences from anything physically real: unbounded numbers of registers each with unbounded capacities. The problem appears most dramatically when one tries to use a counter-machine model to build a RASP that is Turing equivalent and thus compute any partial mu recursive function:Melzak (1961) added indirection to his \"hole-and-pebble\" model so that his model could modify itself with a \"computed goto\" and provides two examples of its use (\"Decimal representation in the scale of d\" and \"Sorting by magnitude\", whether these are used in his proof that the model is Turing equivalent is unclear since \"the program itself is left to the reader as an exercise\" (p. 292)). Minsky (1961, 1967) was able to demonstrate that, with suitable (but difficult-to-use) Gödel number encoding, the register model did not need indirection to be Turing equivalent; but it did need at least one unbounded register. As noted below, Minsky (1967) hints at the problem for a RASP but doesn't offer a solution. Elgot and Robinson (1964) proved that their RASP model P0it has no indirection capabilitycannot compute all \"recursive sequential functions\" (ones that have parameters of arbitrary length) if it does not have the capability of modifying its own instructions, but it can via Gödel numbers if it does (p. 395-397; in particular figure 2 and footnote p. 395). On the other hand their RASP model P'0 equipped with an \"index register\" (indirect addressing) can compute all the \"partial recursive sequential functions\" (the mu recursive functions) (p. 397-398).Cook and Reckhow (1973) say it most succinctly:\nThe indirect instructions are necessary in order for a fixed program to access an unbounded number of registers as the inputs vary.\" (p. 73)\n\nUnbounded capacities of registers versus bounded capacities of state-machine instructions: The so-called finite state part of the machine is supposed to beby the normal definition of algorithmvery finite both in the number of \"states\" (instructions) and the instructions' sizes (their capacity to hold symbols/signs). So how does a state machine move an arbitrarily large constant directly into a register, e.g. MOVE (k, r) (Move constant k to register r)? If huge constants are necessary they must either start out in the registers themselves or be created by the state machine using a finite number of instructions e.g. multiply  and add subroutines using INC and DEC (but not a quasi-infinite number of these!).\nSometimes the constant k will be created by use of CLR ( r ) followed by INC ( r ) repeated k timese.g. to put the constant k=3 into register r, i.e. 3 → r, so at the end of the instruction [r]=3: CLR (r), INC (r), INC (r), INC (r). This trick is mentioned by Kleene (1952) p. 223. The problem arises when the number to be created exhausts the number of instructions available to the finite state machine; there is always a bigger constant than the number of instructions available to the finite state machine.\n\nUnbounded numbers of registers versus bounded state-machine instructions: This is more severe than the first problem. In particular, this problem arises when we attempt to build a so-called RASP, a \"universal machine\" (see more at Universal Turing machine) that uses its finite-state machine to interpret a \"program of instructions\" located in its registersi.e. we are building what is nowadays called a computer with the von Neumann architecture.Observe that the counter machine's finite state machine must call out a register explicitly (directly) by its name/number: INC (65,356) calls out register number \"65,365\" explicitly. If the number of registers exceeds the capability of the finite state machine to address them, then registers outside the bounds will be unreachable. For example, if the finite state machine can only reach 65,536 = 216 registers then how can it reach the 65,537th?\n\nSo how do we address a register beyond the bounds of the finite state machine? One approach would be to modify the program-instructions (the ones stored in the registers) so that they contain more than one command. But this too can be exhausted unless an instruction is of (potentially) unbounded size. So why not use just one \"über-instruction\"one really really big numberthat contains all the program instructions encoded into it! This is how Minsky solves the problem, but the Gödel numbering he uses represents a great inconvenience to the model, and the result is nothing at all like our intuitive notion of a \"stored program computer\".\n\nElgot and Robinson (1964) come to a similar conclusion with respect to a RASP that is \"finitely determined\". Indeed it can access an unbounded number of registers (e.g. to fetch instructions from them) but only if the RASP allows \"self modification\" of its program instructions, and has encoded its \"data\" in a Gödel number (Fig. 2 p. 396).\n\nIn the context of a more computer-like model using his RPT (repeat) instruction Minsky (1967) tantalizes us with a solution to the problem (cf p. 214, p. 259) but offers no firm resolution. He asserts:\n\"In general a RPT operation could not be an instruction in the finite-state part of the machine ... this might exhaust any particular amount of storage allowed in the finite part of the computer [sic, his name for his RAM models]. RPT operations require infinite registers of their own.\" (p. 214).\n\nHe offers us a bounded RPT that together with CLR (r) and INC (r) can compute any primitive recursive function, and he offers the unbounded RPT quoted above that as playing the role of μ operator; it together with CLR (r) and INC (r) can compute the mu recursive functions. But he does not discuss \"indirection\" or the RAM model per se.\n\nFrom the references in Hartmanis (1971) it appears that Cook (in his lecture notes while at UC Berkeley, 1970) has firmed up the notion of indirect addressing. This becomes clearer in the paper of Cook and Reckhow (1973)Cook is Reckhow's Master's thesis advisor. Hartmanis' modelquite similar to Melzak's (1961) modeluses two and three-register adds and subtracts and two parameter copies; Cook and Reckhow's model reduce the number of parameters (registers called out in the program instructions) to one call-out by use of an accumulator \"AC\".\n\nThe solution in a nutshell: Design our machine/model with unbounded indirectionprovide an unbounded \"address\" register that can potentially name (call out) any register no matter how many there are. For this to work, in general, the unbounded register requires an ability to be cleared and then incremented (and, possibly, decremented) by a potentially infinite loop. In this sense the solution represents the unbounded μ operator that can, if necessary, hunt ad infinitim along the unbounded string of registers until it finds what it is looking for. The pointer register is exactly like any other register with one exception: under the circumstances called \"indirect addressing\" it provides its contents, rather than the address-operand in the state machine's TABLE, to be the address of the target register (including possibly itself!).\n\n Bounded indirection and the primitive recursive functions \nIf we eschew the Minsky approach of one monster number in one register, and specify that our machine model will be \"like a computer\" we have to confront this problem of indirection if we are to compute the recursive functions (also called the μ-recursive functions )both total and partial varieties.\n\nOur simpler counter-machine model can do a \"bounded\" form of indirectionand thereby compute the sub-class of primitive recursive functionsby using a primitive recursive \"operator\" called \"definition by cases\" (defined in Kleene (1952) p. 229 and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey p. 74). Such a \"bounded indirection\" is a laborious, tedious affair. \"Definition by cases\" requires the machine to determine/distinguish the contents of the pointer register by attempting, time after time until success, to match this contents against a number/name that the case operator explicitly declares. Thus the definition by cases starts from e.g. the lower bound address and continues ad nauseam toward the upper bound address attempting to make a match:\n Is the number in register N equal to 0? If not then is it equal to 1? 2? 3? ... 65364? If not then we're at the last number 65365 and this had better be the one, else we have a problem!\"Bounded\" indirection will not allow us to compute the partial recursive functionsfor those we need unbounded indirection aka the μ operator.Suppose we had been able to continue on to number 65367, and in fact that register had what we were looking for. Then we could have completed our calculation successfully! But suppose 65367 didn't have what we needed. How far should we continue to go?To be Turing equivalent the counter machine needs to either use the unfortunate single-register Minsky Gödel number method, or be augmented with an ability to explore the ends of its register string, ad infinitum if necessary. (A failure to find something \"out there\" defines what it means for an algorithm to fail to terminate; cf Kleene (1952) pp. 316ff Chapter XII Partial Recursive Functions, in particular p. 323-325.) See more on this in the example below.\n\n Unbounded indirection and the partial recursive functions \nFor unbounded indirection we require a \"hardware\" change in our machine model. Once we make this change the model is no longer a counter machine, but rather a random-access machine.\n\nNow when e.g. INC  is specified, the finite state machine's instruction will have to specify where the address of the register of interest will come from. This where can be either (i) the state machine's instruction that provides an explicit label, or (ii) the pointer-register whose contents is the address of interest. Whenever an instruction specifies a register address it now will also need to specify an additional parameter \"i/d\"\"indirect/direct\". In a sense this new \"i/d\" parameter is a \"switch\" that flips one way to get the direct address as specified in the instruction or the other way to get the indirect address from the pointer register (which pointer registerin some models every register can be a pointer registeris specified by the instruction). This \"mutually exclusive but exhaustive choice\" is yet another example of \"definition by cases\", and the arithmetic equivalent shown in the example below is derived from the definition in Kleene (1952) p. 229.\n\nExample: CPY ( indirectsource, rsource, directdestination, rdestination )\n\nAssign a code to specify direct addressing as d=\"0\" and indirect addressing as i=\"1\". Then our machine can determine the source address as follows:\n i*[rs] + (1-i)*rs\nFor example, suppose the contents of register 3 are \"5\" (i.e. [3]=5 ) and the contents of register 4 are \"2\" (i.e. [4]=2 ):\n\n Example: CPY ( 1, 3, 0, 4 ) = CPY ( indirect, reg 3, direct, reg 4 )\n 1*[3] + 0*3 = [3] = source-register address 5\n 0*[4] + 1*4 = 4 = destination-register address 4\n\n Example: CPY ( 0, 3, 0, 4 )\n 0*[3] + 1*3 = 3 = source-register address 3\n 0*[4] + 1*4 = 4 = destination-register address 4\n\n Example: CPY ( 0, 3, 1, 4 )\n 0*[3] + 1*3 = 3 = source-register address 3\n 1*[4] + 0*4 = [4] = destination-register address 2\n\n The indirect COPY instruction \nProbably the most useful of the added instructions is COPY. Indeed, Elgot-Robinson (1964) provide their models P0 and P'0 with the COPY instructions, and Cook-Reckhow (1973) provide their accumulator-based model with only two indirect instructionsCOPY to accumulator indirectly, COPY from accumulator indirectly.\n\nA plethora of instructions: Because any instruction acting on a single register can be augmented with its indirect \"dual\" (including conditional and unconditional jumps, cf the Elgot-Robinson model), the inclusion of indirect instructions will double the number of single parameter/register instructions (e.g. INC (d, r), INC (i, r)). Worse, every two parameter/register instruction will have 4 possible varieties, e.g.:\n\n CPY (d, rs, d, rd ) = COPY directly from source-register directly to destination-register\n CPY (i, rsp, d, rd ) = COPY to destination-register indirectly using the source address to be found in the source-pointer register rsp.\n CPY (d, rs, i, rdp ) = COPY contents of source-register indirectly into register using destination address to be found in the destination-pointer register rdp.\n CPY (i, rsp, i, rdp ) = COPY indirectly the contents of the source register with address to be found in source-pointer register rsp, into the destination register with address to be found in the destination-pointer register rdp)\n\nIn a similar manner every three-register instruction that involves two source registers rs1 rs2 and a destination register rd will result in 8 varieties, for example the addition:\n [rs1] + [rs2] → rd\n\nwill yield:\n ADD ( d, rs1, d, rs2, d, rd )\n ADD ( i, rsp1, d, rs2, d, rd )\n ADD ( d, rs1, i, rsp2, d, rd )\n ADD ( i, rsp1, i, rsp2, d, rd )\n ADD ( d, rs1, d, rs2, i, rdp )\n ADD ( i, rsp1, d, rs2, i, rdp )\n ADD ( d, rs1, i, rsp2, i, rdp )\n ADD ( i, rsp1, i, rsp2, i, rdp )\n\nIf we designate one register to be the \"accumulator\" (see below) and place strong restrictions on the various instructions allowed then we can greatly reduce the plethora of direct and indirect operations. However, one must be sure that the resulting reduced instruction-set is sufficient, and we must be aware that the reduction will come at the expense of more instructions per \"significant\" operation.\n\n The notion of \"accumulator A\" \nHistorical convention dedicates a register to the accumulator,  an \"arithmetic organ\" that literally accumulates its number during a sequence of arithmetic operations:\n\"The first part of our arithmetic organ ... should be a parallel storage organ which can receive a number and add it to the one already in it, which is also able to clear its contents and which can store what it contains. We will call such an organ an Accumulator. It is quite conventional in principle in past and present computing machines of the most varied types, e.g. desk multipliers, standard IBM counters, more modern relay machines, the ENIAC\" (boldface in original: Goldstine and von Neumann, 1946; p. 98 in Bell and Newell 1971).\n\nHowever, the accumulator comes at the expense of more instructions per arithmetic \"operation\", in particular with respect to what are called 'read-modify-write' instructions such as \"Increment indirectly the contents of the register pointed to by register r2 \". \"A\" designates the \"accumulator\" register A:\n\n Label Instruction A r2 r378,426 Description     . . .\n  378,426\n  17\n  INCi ( r2 ):\n  CPY ( i, r2, d, A )\n  17\n  378,426\n  17\n  Contents of r2 points to r378,426 with contents \"17\": copy this to A  INC ( A )\n  18\n  378,426\n  17\n  Incement contents of A  CPY ( d, A, i, r2 )\n   18\n  378,426 18\n  Contents of r2 points to r378,426: copy contents of A into r378,426\n\nIf we stick with a specific name for the accumulator, e.g. \"A\", we can imply the accumulator in the instructions, for example,\n INC ( A ) = INCA\nHowever, when we write the CPY instructions without the accumulator called out the instructions are ambiguous or they must have empty parameters:\n CPY ( d, r2, d, A ) = CPY (d, r2, , )\n CPY ( d, A, d, r2 ) = CPY ( , , d, r2)\n\nHistorically what has happened is these two CPY instructions have received distinctive names; however, no convention exists. Tradition (e.g. Knuth's (1973) imaginary MIX computer) uses two names called LOAD and STORE. Here we are adding the \"i/d\" parameter:\n LDA ( d/i, rs ) =def  CPY ( d/i, rs, d, A )\n STA ( d/i, rd ) =def  CPY ( d, A, d/i, rd )\n\nThe typical accumulator-based model will have all its two-variable arithmetic and constant operations (e.g. ADD (A, r), SUB (A, r) ) use (i) the accumulator's contents, together with (ii) a specified register's contents.  The one-variable operations (e.g. INC (A), DEC (A) and CLR (A) ) require only the accumulator. Both instruction-types deposit the result (e.g. sum, difference, product, quotient or remainder) in the accumulator.\n Example: INCA = [A] +1 → A\n Example: ADDA (rs) = [A] + [rs] → A\n Example: MULA (rs) = [A] * [rs] → A\n\nIf we so choose, we can abbreviate the mnemonics because at least one source-register and the destination register is always the accumulator A. Thus we have :\n{ LDA (i/d, rs), STA (i/d, rd), CLRA, INCA, DECA, ADDA (rs), SUBA (rs), MULA (rs), DIVA (rs), etc.)\n\n The notion of indirect address register \"N\" \nIf our model has an unbounded accumulator can we bound all the other registers? Not until we provide for at least one unbounded register from which we derive our indirect addresses.\n\nThe minimimalist approach is to use itself (Schönhage does this).\n\nAnother approach (Schönhage does this too) is to declare a specific register the \"indirect address register\" and confine indirection relative to this register (Schonhage's RAM0 model uses both A and N registers for indirect as well as direct instructions). Again our new register has no conventional nameperhaps \"N\" from \"iNdex\", or \"iNdirect\" or \"address Number\".\n\nFor maximum flexibility, as we have done for the accumulator Awe will consider N just another register subject to increment, decrement, clear, test, direct copy, etc. Again we can shrink the instruction to a single-parameter that provides for direction and indirection, for example.\n LDAN (i/d) = CPY (i/d, N, d, A); LoaD Accumulator via iNdirection register\n STAN (i/d) = CPY (d, A, i/d, N). STore Accumlator via iNdirection register\n\nWhy is this such an interesting approach? At least two reasons:\n\n(1) An instruction set with no parameters:\n\nSchönhage does this to produce his RAM0 instruction set. See section below.\n\n(2) Reduce a RAM to a Post-Turing machine:\n\nPosing as minimalists, we reduce all the registers excepting the accumulator A and indirection register N e.g. r = { r0, r1, r2, ... } to an unbounded string of (very-) bounded-capacity pigeon-holes. These will do nothing but hold (very-) bounded numbers e.g. a lone bit with value { 0, 1 }. Likewise we shrink the accumulator to a single bit. We restrict any arithmetic to the registers { A, N }, use indirect operations to pull the contents of registers into the accumulator and write 0 or 1 from the accumulator to a register:\n{ LDA (i, N), STA (i, N), CLR (A/N), INC (A/N), DEC(N), JZ (A/N, Iz), JZ (Iz), H }\n\nWe push further and eliminate A altogether by the use of two \"constant\" registers called \"ERASE\" and \"PRINT\": [ERASE]=0, [PRINT]=1.\n{ CPY (d, ERASE, i, N), CPY (d, PRINT, i, N), CLR (N), INC (N), DEC (N), JZ (i, N, Iz), JZ (Iz), H }\n\nRename the COPY instructions and call INC (N) = RIGHT, DEC (N) = LEFT and we have the same instructions as the Post-Turing machine, plus an extra CLRN :\n{ ERASE, PRINT, CLRN, RIGHT, LEFT, JZ (i, N, Iz), JZ (Iz), H }\n\n Turing equivalence of the RAM with indirection \nIn the section above we informally showed that a RAM with an unbounded indirection capability produces a Post–Turing machine. The Post–Turing machine is Turing equivalent, so we have shown that the RAM with indirection is Turing equivalent.\n\nWe give here a slightly more formal demonstration. Begin by designing our model with three reserved registers \"E\", \"P\", and \"N\", plus an unbounded set of registers 1, 2, ..., n to the right. The registers 1, 2, ..., n will be considered \"the squares of the tape\". Register \"N\" points to \"the scanned square\" that \"the head\" is currently observing. The \"head\" can be thought of as being in the conditional jumpobserve that it uses indirect addressing (cf Elgot-Robinson p. 398). As we decrement or increment \"N\" the (apparent) head will \"move left\" or \"right\" along the squares. We will move the contents of \"E\"=0 or \"P\"=1 to the \"scanned square\" as pointed to by N, using the indirect CPY.\n\nThe fact that our tape is left-ended presents us with a minor problem: Whenever LEFT occurs our instructions will have to test to determine whether or not the contents of \"N\" is zero; if so we should leave its count at \"0\" (this is our choice as designersfor example we might have the machine/model \"trigger an event\" of our choosing).\n\nInstruction set 1 (augmented): { INC (N), DEC (N), CLR (N), CPY (d, rs,i, N), JZ ( i, r, z ), HALT }\n\nThe following table both defines the Post-Turing instructions in terms of their RAM equivalent instructions and gives an example of their functioning. The (apparent)location of the head along the tape of registers r0-r5 . . . is shown shaded:\n Mnemonic label: E P N r0 r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 etc. Action on registers Action on finite state machine Instruction Register IR                 start:\n    0\n  1\n  3\n     1\n  0\n     R right: INC ( N ) 0 1 4 1 0 [N] +1 → N [IR] +1 → IR P print: CPY ( d, P, i, N ) 0 1 4 1 1 [P]=1 → [N]=r4 [IR] +1 → IR E erase: CPY ( d, E, i, N ) 0 1 4 1 0 [E]=0 → [N]=r4 [IR] +1 → IR L left: JZ ( i, N, end ) 0 1 4 1 0 none IF N =r4] =0 THEN \"end\" → IR else [IR]+1 → IR DEC ( N ) 0 1 3 1 0 [N] -1 → N J0 ( halt ) jump_if_blank: JZ ( i, N, end ) 0 1 3 1 0 none IF N =r3] =0 THEN \"end\" → IR else [IR]+1 → IR J1 ( halt ) jump_if_mark: JZ ( i, N, halt ) 0 1 3 1 0 N =r3] → A IF N =r3] =0 THEN \"end\" → IR else [IR]+1 → IR end  . . . etc. 0 1 3 1 0 halt:\n  H\n   0 1 3\n     1 0\n    none\n  [IR] +1 → IR\n\n Example: Bounded indirection yields a machine that is not Turing equivalent \nThroughout this demonstration we have to keep in mind that the instructions in the finite state machine's TABLE is bounded, i.e. finite:\n\"Besides a merely being a finite set of rules which gives a sequence of operations for solving a specific type of problem, an algorithm has five important features [Finiteness, Definiteness, Input, Output, Effectiveness]\" (italics added, Knuth p. 4-7).The difficulty arises because the registers have explicit \"names\" (numbers) and our machine must call each out by name in order to \"access\" it.We will build the indirect CPY ( i, q, d, φ ) with the CASE operator. The address of the target register will be specified by the contents of register \"q\"; once the CASE operator has determined what this number is, CPY will directly deposit the contents of the register with that number into register \"φ\". We will need an additional register that we will call \"y\"it serves as an up-counter.So the following is actually a constructive demonstration or proof that we can indeed simulate the indirect CPY ( i, q, d, φ ) without a \"hardware\" design change to our counter machine/model. However, note that because this indirect CPY is \"bounded\" by the size/extent of the finite state machine, a RASP using this indirect CPY can only calculate the primitive recursive functions, not the full suite of mu recursive functions.The CASE \"operator\" is described in Kleene (1952) (p. 229) and in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (p. 74); the latter authors emphasize its utility. The following definition is per Kleene but modified to reflect the familiar \"IF-THEN-ELSE\" construction.\n\nThe CASE operator \"returns\" a natural number into φ depending on which \"case\" is satisfied, starting with \"case_0\" and going successively through \"case_last\"; if no case is satisfied then the number called \"default\" (aka \"woops\") is returned into φ (here x designates some selection of parameters, e.g. register q and the string r0, ... rlast )):Definition by cases φ (x, y):\n case_0: IF Q0(x, y) is true THEN φ0(x, y) ELSE\n case_1: IF Q1(x, y) is true THEN φ1(x, y) ELSE\n cases_2 through case_next_to_last: etc. . . . . . . . . ELSE\n case_last: IF Qlast(x, y) is true THEN φlast(x, y) ELSE\n default: do φdefault(x, y)\n\nKleene require that the \"predicates\" Qn that doing the testing are all mutually exclusive\"predicates\" are functions that produce only { true, false } for output; Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey add the requirement that the cases are \"exhaustive\".\n\nWe begin with a number in register q that represents the address of the target register. But what is this number? The \"predicates\" will test it to find out, one trial after another: JE (q, y, z) followed by INC (y). Once the number is identified explicitly, the CASE operator directly/explicitly copies the contents of this register to φ:Definition by cases CPY (i, q, d, φ) =def φ (q, r0, ..., rlast, y) =\n case_0: IF CLR (y), [q] - [y]=0  THEN CPY ( r0, φ ), J (exit) ELSE\n case_1: IF  INC (y), [q] = [y]=1 THEN CPY ( r1, φ ), J (exit) ELSE\n case_2 through case n: IF . . . THEN . . . ELSE\n case_n: IF  INC (y), [q] = [y]=n THEN CPY ( rn, φ ), J (exit) ELSE\n case_n+1 to case_last: IF . . . THEN . . . ELSE\n case_last: IF INC (y), [q] = [y]=\"last\" THEN CPY ( rlast, φ ), J (exit) ELSE\n default: woops\n\nCase_0 ( the base step of the recursion on y) looks like this:\n case_0:\n CLR ( y ) ; set register y = 0\n JE ( q, y, _φ0 )\n J ( case_1 )\n _φ0: CPY ( r0, φ )\n J ( exit )\n case_1: etc.\n\nCase_n (the induction step) looks like this; remember, each instance of \"n\", \"n+1\", ..., \"last\" must be an explicit natural number:\n case_n:\n INC ( y )\n JE ( q, y, _φn )\n J ( case_n+1)\n _φn: CPY ( rn, φ )\n J ( exit )case__n+1: etc.\n\nCase_last stops the induction and bounds the CASE operator (and thereby bounds the \"indirect copy\" operator):\n case_last:\n INC ( y )\n JE ( q, y, _φlast )\n J ( woops )\n _φlast: CPY ( rlast, φ )\n J ( exit )woops: how do we handle an out-of-bounds attempt?exit: etc.\n\nIf the CASE could continue ad infinitum it would be the mu operator. But it can'tits finite state machine's \"state register\" has reached its maximum count (e.g. 65365 = 11111111,111111112 ) or its table has run out of instructions; it is a finite machine, after all.\n\n Examples of models \n\n Register-to-register (\"read-modify-write\") model of Cook and Reckhow (1973) \nThe commonly encountered Cook and Rechkow model is a bit like the ternary-register Malzek model (written with Knuth mnemonicsthe original instructions had no mnemonics excepting TRA, Read, Print).\n\n LOAD ( C, rd ) ; C → rd, C is any integer\n Example: LOAD ( 0, 5 ) will clear register 5.\n ADD ( rs1, rs2, rd  ) ; [rs1] + [rs2] → rd, the registers can be the same or different;\nExample: ADD ( A, A, A ) will double the contents of register A.\n SUB ( rs1, rs2, rd ) ; [rs1] - [rs2] → rd, the registers can be the same or different:\nExample: SUB ( 3, 3, 3 ) will clear register 3.\n COPY ( i, rp, d, rd ) ; [[rp] ] →  rd, Indirectly copy the contents of the source-register pointed to by pointer-register rp into the destination register.\n COPY ( d, rs, i, rp ) ; [rs] → [rp]. Copy the contents of source register rs into the destination-register pointed to by the pointer-register rp.\n JNZ ( r, Iz ) ; Conditional jump if [r] is positive; i.e. IF [r] > 0 THEN jump to instruction z else continue in sequence (Cook and Reckhow call this: \"TRAnsfer control to line m if Xj > 0\")\n READ ( rd ) ; copy \"the input\" into destination register rd\n PRINT ( rs ) ; copy the contents of source register rs to \"the output.\"\n\n Schönhage's RAM0 and RAM1 (1980) \nSchönhage (1980) describes a very primitive, atomized model chosen for his proof of the equivalence of his SMM pointer machine model:\n\"In order to avoid any explicit addressing the RAM0 has the accumulator with contents z and an additional address register with current contents n (initially 0)\" (p. 494)\n\nRAM1 model: Schönhage demonstrates how his construction can be used to form the more common, usable form of \"successor\"-like RAM (using this article's mnemonics):\n LDA k ; k --> A , k is a constant, an explicit number such as \"47\"\n LDA ( d, r ) ; [r] → A ; directly load A\n LDA ( i, r ) ; [[r]] → A ; indirectly load A\n STA ( d, r ) ; [A] → r ; directly store A\n STA ( i, r ) ; [A] → [r] ; indirectly store A\n JEA ( r, z ) ; IF [A] = [r] then Iz else continue\n INCA ; [A] + 1 --> A \n\nRAM0 model: Schönhage's RAM0 machine has 6 instructions indicated by a single letter (the 6th \"C xxx\" seems to involve 'skip over next parameter'.

    "text": "In probability theory, the Schramm–Loewner evolution with parameter κ, also known as stochastic Loewner evolution (SLEκ), is a family of random planar curves that have been proven to be the scaling limit of a variety of two-dimensional lattice models in statistical mechanics. Given a parameter κ and a domain in the complex plane U, it gives a family of random curves in U, with κ controlling how much the curve turns. There are two main variants of SLE, chordal SLE which gives a family of random curves from two fixed boundary points, and radial SLE, which gives a family of random curves from a fixed boundary point to a fixed interior point. These curves are defined to satisfy conformal invariance and a domain Markov property.\n\nIt was discovered by  as a conjectured scaling limit of the planar uniform spanning tree (UST) and the planar loop-erased random walk (LERW) probabilistic processes, and developed by him together with Greg Lawler and Wendelin Werner in a series of joint papers.\n\nBesides UST and LERW, the Schramm–Loewner evolution is conjectured or proven to describe the scaling limit of various stochastic processes in the plane, such as critical percolation, the critical Ising model, the double-dimer model, self-avoiding walks, and other critical statistical mechanics models that exhibit conformal invariance. The SLE curves are the scaling limits of interfaces and other non-self-intersecting random curves in these models. The main idea is that the conformal invariance and a certain Markov property inherent in such stochastic processes together make it possible to encode these planar curves into a one-dimensional Brownian motion running on the boundary of the domain (the driving function in Loewner's differential equation). This way, many important questions about the planar models can be translated into exercises in Itō calculus. Indeed, several mathematically non-rigorous predictions made by physicists using conformal field theory have been proven using this strategy.\n\nThe Loewner equation\n\nIf D is a simply connected, open complex domain not equal to C, and γ  is a simple curve in D starting on the boundary (a continuous function with γ(0) on the boundary of D and γ((0, ∞)) a subset of D), then for each t ≥ 0, the complement Dt of γ([0, t]) is simply connected and therefore conformally isomorphic to D by the Riemann mapping theorem. If ƒt is a suitable normalized isomorphism from D to Dt, then it satisfies a differential equation found by  in his work on the Bieberbach conjecture.\nSometimes it is more convenient to use the inverse function gt of ƒt, which is a conformal mapping from Dt to D.\n\nIn Loewner's equation, z is in the domain D, t ≥ 0, and the boundary values at time t = 0 are ƒ0(z) = z or g0(z) = z. The equation depends on a driving function ζ(t) taking values in the boundary of D.  If D is the unit disk and the curve γ is parameterized by \"capacity\", then Loewner's equation is\n\n   or   \n\nWhen D is the upper half plane the Loewner equation differs from this by changes of variable and is\n\n   or   \n\nThe driving function ζ and the curve γ are related by\n\nwhere ƒt and gt are extended by continuity.\n\nExample\n\nLet D be the upper half plane and consider an SLE0, so the driving function ζ is a Brownian motion of diffusivity zero. The function ζ is thus identically zero almost surely and\n\n is the upper half-plane with the line from 0 to  removed.\n\n Schramm–Loewner evolution \nSchramm–Loewner evolution is the random curve γ given by the Loewner equation as in the previous section, for the driving function\n\nwhere B(t) is Brownian motion on the boundary of D, scaled by some real κ. In other words Schramm–Loewner evolution is a probability measure on planar curves, given as the image of Wiener measure under this map.\n\nIn general the curve γ need not be simple, and the domain Dt is not the complement of γ([0,t]) in D, but is instead the unbounded component of the complement.\n\nThere are two versions of SLE, using two families of curves, each depending on a non-negative real parameter κ:\n\nChordal SLEκ, which is related to curves connecting two points on the boundary of a domain (usually the upper half plane, with the points being 0 and infinity).\nRadial SLEκ, which related to curves joining a point on the boundary of a domain to a point in the interior (often curves joining 1 and 0 in the unit disk).\n\nSLE depends on a choice of Brownian motion on the boundary of the domain, and there are several variations depending on what sort of Brownian motion is used: for example it might start at a fixed point, or start at a uniformly distributed point on the unit circle, or might have a built in drift, and so on. The parameter κ controls the rate of diffusion of the Brownian motion, and the behavior of SLE depends critically on its value.\n\nThe two domains most commonly used in Schramm–Loewner evolution are the upper half plane and the unit circle. Although the Loewner differential equation in these two cases look different, they are equivalent up to changes of variables as the unit circle and the upper half plane are conformally equivalent. However a conformal equivalence between them does not preserve the Brownian motion on their boundaries used to drive Schramm–Loewner evolution.\n\nSpecial values of κ\n\nFor 0 ≤ κ ≤ 4 the curve γ(t) is simple (with probability 1).\nFor 4 < κ < 8 the curve γ(t) intersects itself and every point is contained in a loop but the curve is not space-filling (with probability 1).\nFor κ ≥ 8 the curve γ(t) is space-filling (with probability 1).\nκ = 2 corresponds to the loop-erased random walk, or equivalently, branches of the uniform spanning tree.\nFor κ = 8/3, SLEκ has the restriction property and is conjectured to be the scaling limit of self-avoiding random walks. A version of it is the outer boundary of Brownian motion.\nκ = 3 is the limit of interfaces for the Ising model.\nκ = 4 corresponds to the path of the harmonic explorer and contour lines of the Gaussian free field.\nFor κ = 6, SLEκ has the locality property. This arises in the scaling limit of critical percolation on the triangular lattice and conjecturally on other lattices.\nκ = 8 corresponds to the path separating the uniform spanning tree from its dual tree.\n\nWhen SLE corresponds to some conformal field theory, the parameter κ is related to the central charge c\nof the conformal field theory by\n\nEach value of c < 1 corresponds to two values of κ, one value κ between 0 and 4, and a \"dual\" value 16/κ greater than 4.\n\n showed that the Hausdorff dimension of the paths (with probability 1) is equal to min(2, 1 + κ/8).\n\n Left passage probability formulas for SLEκ \n\nThe probability of chordal SLEκ γ being on the left of fixed point  was computed by \n\nwhere  is the Gamma function and  is the hypergeometric function. This was derived by using the martingale property of\n\nand Itô's lemma to obtain the following partial differential equation for \n\nFor κ = 4, the RHS is , which was used in the construction of the , and for κ = 6, we obtain Cardy's formula, which was used by  to prove conformal invariance in percolation.\n\nApplications\n used SLE6 to prove the conjecture of  that the boundary of planar Brownian motion has fractal dimension 4/3.\n\nCritical percolation on the triangular lattice was proved to be related to SLE6 by Stanislav Smirnov. Combined with earlier work of Harry Kesten, this led to the determination of many of the critical exponents for percolation. This breakthrough, in turn, allowed further analysis of many aspects of this model.\n\nLoop-erased random walk was shown to converge to SLE2 by Lawler, Schramm and Werner. This allowed derivation of many quantitative properties of loop-erased random walk (some of which were derived earlier by Richard Kenyon). The related random Peano curve outlining the uniform spanning tree was shown to converge to SLE8.\n\nRohde and Schramm showed that κ is related to the fractal dimension of a curve by the following relation\n\nSimulation\nComputer programs (Matlab) are presented in this github repository to simulate Schramm Loewner Evolution planar curves.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n \n\n  (Chapter 6 treats the classical theory of Loewner's equation)\n Schramm's original paper, introducing SLE\n\nExternal links\n ( video of MSRI lecture)\n (Slides from a talk.)\n\nCategory:Stochastic processes\nCategory:Complex analysis"

Through the centuries, Italy has advanced the scientific community which produced many significant inventions and discoveries in biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy and the other sciences.\n\nRoman engineering\nBy the first century AD, Rome had become the biggest and most advanced city in the world. The ancient Romans came up with new technologies to improve the city's sanitation systems, roads, and buildings. They developed a system of aqueducts that piped freshwater into the city, and they built sewers that removed the city's waste. The wealthiest Romans lived in large houses with gardens. Most of the population, however, lived in apartment buildings made of stone, concrete, or limestone. The Romans developed new techniques and used materials such as volcanic soil from Pozzuoli, a village near Naples, to make their cement harder and stronger. This concrete allowed them to build large apartment buildings called insulae.\n\nRenaissance science\nItaly had a scientific \"golden age\" during the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci, was trained to be a painter, but his interests and achievements spread into an astonishing variety of fields that are now considered scientific specialties. He conceived of ideas vastly ahead of his time. Notably, he invented concepts for the helicopter, an armed fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated solar power, the calculator, a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics, the double hull, and many others, using inspiration from Chinese ideas.

    "title": "Soft robotics",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_robotics",
    "text": "thumb|420px|Soft-Legged Wheel-Based Robot with Terrestrial Locomotion Abilities.\n\nSoft Robotics is the specific subfield of robotics dealing with constructing robots from highly compliant materials, similar to those found in living organisms.Trivedi, D., Rahn, C. D., Kier, W. M., & Walker, I. D. (2008). Soft robotics: Biological inspiration, state of the art, and future research. Applied Bionics and Biomechanics, 5(3), 99-117.\n\nSoft robotics draws heavily from the way in which living organisms move and adapt to their surroundings. In contrast to robots built from rigid materials, soft robots allow for increased flexibility and adaptability for accomplishing tasks, as well as improved safety when working around humans. These characteristics allow for its potential use in the fields of medicine and manufacturing.\n\n Types and designs \nThe bulk of the field of soft robotics is based upon the design and construction of robots made completely from compliant materials, with the end result being similar to invertebrates like worms and octopuses. The motion of these robots is difficult to model, as continuum mechanics apply to them, and they are sometimes referred to as continuum robots. Soft Robotics is the specific sub-field of robotics dealing with constructing robots from highly compliant materials, similar to those found in living organisms. Similarly, soft robotics also draws heavily from the way in which these living organisms move and adapt to their surroundings. This allows scientists to use soft robots to understand biological phenomena using experiments that cannot be easily performed on the original biological counterparts. In contrast to robots built from rigid materials, soft robots allow for increased flexibility and adaptability for accomplishing tasks, as well as improved safety when working around humans. These characteristics allow for its potential use in the fields of medicine and manufacturing. However, there exist rigid robots that are also capable of continuum deformations, most notably the snake-arm robot.\n\nAlso, certain soft robotic mechanics may be used as a piece in a larger, potentially rigid robot. Soft robotic end effectors exist for grabbing and manipulating objects, and they have the advantage of producing a low force that is good for holding delicate objects without breaking them.\n\nIn addition, hybrid soft-rigid robots may be built using an internal rigid framework with soft exteriors for safety. The soft exterior may be multifunctional, as it can act as both the actuators for the robot, similar to muscles in vertebrates, and as padding in case of a collision with a person.\n\n Bio-mimicry \nPlant cells can inherently produce hydrostatic pressure due to a solute concentration gradient between the cytoplasm and external surroundings (osmotic potential). Further, plants can adjust this concentration through the movement of ions across the cell membrane. This then changes the shape and volume of the plant as it responds to this change in hydrostatic pressure. This pressure derived shape evolution is desirable for soft robotics and can be emulated to create pressure adaptive materials through the use of fluid flow. The following equation models the cell volume change rate:\n\n is the rate of volume change.\n is the cell membrane.\n is the hydraulic conductivity of the material.\n is the change in hydrostatic pressure.\n is the change in osmotic potential.\n\nThis principle has been leveraged in the creation of pressure systems for soft robotics. These systems are composed of soft resins and contain multiple fluid sacs with semi-permeable membranes. The semi-permeability allows for fluid transport that then leads to pressure generation. This combination of fluid transport and pressure generation then leads to shape and volume change.\n\nAnother biologically inherent shape changing mechanism is that of hygroscopic shape change. In this mechanism, plant cells react to changes in humidity. When the surrounding atmosphere has a high humidity, the plant cells swell, but when the surrounding atmosphere has a low humidity, the plant cells shrink. This volume change has been observed in pollen grains and pine cone scales.\n\n Manufacturing \nConventional manufacturing techniques, such as subtractive techniques like drilling and milling, are unhelpful when it comes to constructing soft robots as these robots have complex shapes with deformable bodies. Therefore, more advanced manufacturing techniques have been developed. Those include Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM), the Smart Composite Microstructure (SCM) process, and 3D multimaterial printing.\n\nSDM is a type of rapid prototyping whereby deposition and machining occur cyclically. Essentially, one deposits a material, machines it, embeds a desired structure, deposits a support for said structure, and then further machines the product to a final shape that includes the deposited material and the embedded part. Embedded hardware includes circuits, sensors, and actuators, and scientists have successfully embedded controls inside of polymeric materials to create soft robots, such as the Stickybot and the iSprawl.\n\nSCM is a process whereby one combines rigid bodies of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) with flexible polymer ligaments. The flexible polymer act as joints for the skeleton. With this process, an integrated structure of the CFRP and polymer ligaments is created through the use of laser machining followed by lamination. This SCM process is utilized in the production of mesoscale robots as the polymer connectors serve as low friction alternatives to pin joints.\n\n3D printing can now be used to print a wide range of silicone inks using Robocasting also known as direct ink writing (DIW). This manufacturing route allows for a seamless production of fluidic elastomer actuators with locally defined mechanical properties. It further enables a digital fabrication of pneumatic silicone actuators exhibiting programmable bioinspired architectures and motions.\nA wide range of fully functional softrobots have been printed using this method including bending, twisting, grabbing and contracting motion. This technique avoids some of the drawbacks of conventional manufacturing routes such as delamination between glued parts. Another additive manufacturing method that produces shape morphing materials whose shape is photosensitive, thermally activated, or water responsive. Essentially, these polymers can automatically change shape upon interaction with water, light, or heat. One such example of a shape morphing material was created through the use of light reactive ink-jet printing onto a polystyrene target. Additionally, shape memory polymers have been rapid prototyped that comprise two different components: a skeleton and a hinge material. Upon printing, the material is heated to a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature of the hinge material. This allows for deformation of the hinge material, while not affecting the skeleton material. Further, this polymer can be continually reformed through heating.\n\n Control methods and materials \nAll soft robots require an actuation system to generate reaction forces, to allow for movement and interaction with its environment. Due to the compliant nature of these robots, soft actuation systems must be able to move without the use of rigid materials that would act as the bones in organisms, or the metal frame that is common in rigid robots. Nevertheless, several control solutions to soft actuation problem exist and have found its use, each possessing advantages and disadvantages. Some examples of control methods and the appropriate materials are listed below.\n\n Electric field \nOne example is utilization of electrostatic force that can be applied in:\n\n Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) that use high-voltage electric field in order to change its shape (example of working DEA). These actuators can produce high forces, have high specific power (W kg−1), produce large strains (>1000%), possess high energy density (>3 MJ m−3), exhibit self-sensing, and achieve fast actuation rates (10 ms  - 1 s). However, the need for high-voltages quickly becomes the limiting factor in the potential practical applications. Additionally, these systems often exhibit leakage currents, tend to have electrical breakdowns (dielectric failure follows Weibull statistics therefore the probability increases with increased electrode area ), and require pre-strain for the greatest deformation. Some of the new research shows that there are ways of overcoming some of these disadvantages, as shown e.g. in Peano-HASEL actuators, which incorporate liquid dielectrics and thin shell components. These approach lowers the applied voltage needed, as well as allows for self-healing during electrical breakdown.\n\n Thermal \n\n Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are smart and reconfigurable materials that serve as an excellent example of thermal actuation that can be used for actuation. These materials will \"remember\" their original shape and will revert to it upon temperature increase. For example, crosslinked polymers can be strained at temperatures above their glass-transition (Tg) or melting-transition (Tm) and then cooled down. When the temperature is increased again, the strain will be released and materials shape will be changed back to the original. This of course suggests that there is only one irreversible movement, but there have been materials demonstrated to have up to 5 temporary shapes. One of the simplest and best known examples of shape memory polymers is a toy called Shrinky Dinks that is made of pre-stretched polystyrene (PS) sheet which can be used to cut out shapes that will shrink significantly when heated. Actuators produced using these materials can achieve strains up to 1000% and have demonstrated a broad range of energy density between <50 kJ m−3 and up to 2 MJ m−3. Definite downsides of SMPs include their slow response (>10 s) and typically low force generated. Examples of SMPs include polyurethane (PU), polyethylene teraphtalate (PET), polyethyleneoxide (PEO) and others.\n Shape memory alloys are behind another control system for soft robotic actuation. Although made of metal, a traditionally rigid material, the springs are made from very thin wires and are just as compliant as other soft materials. These springs have a very high force-to-mass ratio, but stretch through the application of heat, which is inefficient energy-wise.\n\n Pressure difference \n\n Pneumatic artificial muscles, another control method used in soft robots, relies on changing the pressure inside a flexible tube. This way it will act as a muscle, contracting and extending, thus applying force to what it's attached to. Through the use of valves, the robot may maintain a given shape using these muscles with no additional energy input. However, this method generally requires an external source of compressed air to function.\n\n Sensors \nSoft stretch sensors are often used to measure the shape and motion of the robot. These measurements are often then fed into a control system.\n\n Uses and applications \nSoft robots can be implemented in the medical profession, specifically for invasive surgery. Soft robots can be made to assist surgeries due to their shape changing properties. Shape change is important as a soft robot could navigate around different structures in the human body by adjusting its form. This could be accomplished through the use of fluidic actuation.\n\nSoft robots may also be used for the creation of flexible exosuits, for rehabilitation of patients, assisting the elderly, or simply enhancing the user's strength. A team from Harvard created an exosuit using these materials in order to give the advantages of the additional strength provided by an exosuit, without the disadvantages that come with how rigid materials restrict a person's natural movement.\n\nTraditionally, manufacturing robots have been isolated from human workers due to safety concerns, as a rigid robot colliding with a human could easily lead to injury due to the fast-paced motion of the robot. However, soft robots could work alongside humans safely, as in a collision the compliant nature of the robot would prevent or minimize any potential injury.\n\nAn application of bio-mimicry via soft robotics is in ocean or space exploration. In the search for extraterrestrial life, scientists need to know more about extraterrestrial bodies of water, as water is the source of life on Earth. Soft robots could be used to mimic sea creatures that can efficiently maneuver through water. Such a project was attempted by a team at Cornell in 2015 under a grant through NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC). The team set out to design a soft robot that would mimic a lamprey or cuttlefish in the way it moved underwater, in order to efficiently explore the ocean below the ice layer of Jupiter's moon, Europa. But exploring a body of water, especially one on another planet, comes with a unique set of mechanical and materials challenges.\n\n Mechanical Considerations in Design \nSoft robots, particularly those designed to imitate life, often must experience cyclic loading in order to move or do the tasks for which they were designed. For example, in the case of the lamprey- or cuttlefish-like robot described above, motion would require electrolyzing water and igniting gas, causing a rapid expansion to propel the robot forward. This repetitive and explosive expansion and contraction would create an environment of intense cyclic loading on the chosen polymeric material. A robot underwater and/or on Europa would be nearly impossible to patch up or replace, so care would need to be taken to choose a material and design that minimizes initiation and propagation of fatigue-cracks. In particular, one should choose a material with a fatigue limit, or a stress-amplitude frequency above which the polymer’s fatigue response is no longer dependent on the frequency. \n\nSecondly, because soft robots are made of highly compliant materials, one must consider temperature effects. The yield stress of a material tends to decrease with temperature, and in polymeric materials this effect is even more extreme. At room temperature and higher temperatures, the long chains in many polymers can stretch and slide past each other, preventing the local concentration of stress in one area and making the material ductile. But most polymers undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature below which there is not enough thermal energy for the long chains to respond in that ductile manner, and fracture is much more likely. The tendency of polymeric materials to turn brittle at cooler temperatures is in fact thought to be responsible for the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, and must be taken very seriously, especially for soft robots that will be implemented in medicine. A ductile-to-brittle transition temperature need not be what one might consider \"cold,\" and is in fact characteristic of the material itself, depending on its crystallinity, toughness, side-group size (in the case of polymers), and other factors.  \n\n International journals \n Soft Robotics (SoRo)\n Soft Robotics section of Frontiers in Robotics and AI\n\n International events \n 2018 Robosoft, first IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics, April 24–28, 2018, Livorno, Italy\n 2017 IROS 2017 Workshop on Soft Morphological Design for Haptic Sensation, Interaction and Display, 24 September 2017, Vancouver, BC, Canada\n 2016 First Soft Robotics Challenge, April 29–30, Livorno, Italy\n 2016 Soft Robotics week, April 25–30, Livorno, Italy\n 2015 \"Soft Robotics: Actuation, Integration, and Applications – Blending research perspectives for a leap forward in soft robotics technology\" at ICRA2015, Seattle WA\n 2014 Workshop on Advances on Soft Robotics, 2014 Robotics Science an Systems (RSS) Conference, Berkeley, CA, July 13, 2014\n 2013 International Workshop on Soft Robotics and Morphological Computation, Monte Verità, July 14–19, 2013\n 2012 Summer School on Soft Robotics, Zurich, June 18–22, 2012\n\n In popular culture \nthumb|Chris Atkeson's robot that inspired the creation of Baymax\nThe 2014 Disney film Big Hero 6 features a soft robot, Baymax, originally designed for use in the healthcare industry.

The first example was the sheaf assigning to a closed subspace its p-th cohomology group. 1945  Jean Leray  Defines Sheaf cohomology using his new concept of sheaf. 1946  Jean Leray  Invents spectral sequences as a method for iteratively approximating cohomology groups by previous approximate cohomology groups. In the limiting case it gives the sought cohomology groups. 1948  Cartan seminar  Writes up sheaf theory for the first time. 1948  A. L. Blakers  Crossed complexes (called group systems by Blakers), after a suggestion of Samuel Eilenberg: A nonabelian generalization of chain complexes of abelian groups which are equivalent to strict ω-groupoids. They form a category Crs that has many satisfactory properties such as a monoidal structure. 1949  John Henry Whitehead  Crossed modules. 1949  André Weil  Formulates the Weil conjectures on remarkable relations between the cohomological structure of algebraic varieties over C and the diophantine structure of algebraic varieties over finite fields. 1950  Henri Cartan  In the book Sheaf theory from the Cartan seminar he defines: Sheaf space (étale space), support of sheaves axiomatically, sheaf cohomology with support in an axiomatic form and more. 1950  John Henry Whitehead  Outlines algebraic homotopy program for describing, understanding and calculating homotopy types of spaces and homotopy classes of mappings 1950  Samuel Eilenberg–Joe Zilber  Simplicial sets as a purely algebraic model of well behaved topological spaces. A simplicial set can also be seen as a presheaf on the simplex category. A category is a simplicial set such that the Segal maps are isomorphisms. 1951  Henri Cartan  Modern definition of sheaf theory in which a sheaf is defined using open subsets instead of closed subsets of a topological space and all the open subsets are treated at once. A sheaf on a topological space X becomes a functor resembling a function defined locally on X, and taking values in sets, abelian groups, commutative rings, modules or generally in any category C. In fact Alexander Grothendieck later made a dictionary between sheaves and functions. Another interpretation of sheaves is as continuously varying sets (a generalization of abstract sets). Its purpose is to provide a unified approach to connect local and global properties of topological spaces and to classify the obstructions for passing from local objects to global objects on a topological space by pasting together the local pieces. The C-valued sheaves on a topological space and their homomorphisms form a category. 1952  William Massey  Invents exact couples for calculating spectral sequences. 1953  Jean-Pierre Serre  Serre C-theory and Serre subcategories. 1955  Jean-Pierre Serre  Shows there is a 1-1 correspondence between algebraic vector bundles over an affine variety and finitely generated projective modules over its coordinate ring (Serre–Swan theorem). 1955  Jean-Pierre Serre  Coherent sheaf cohomology in algebraic geometry. 1956  Jean-Pierre Serre  GAGA correspondence. 1956  Henri Cartan–Samuel Eilenberg  Influential book: Homological Algebra, summarizing the state of the art in its topic at that time. The notation Torn and Extn, as well as the concepts of projective module, projective and injective resolution of a module, derived functor and hyperhomology appear in this book for the first time. 1956  Daniel Kan  Simplicial homotopy theory also called categorical homotopy theory: A homotopy theory completely internal to the category of simplicial sets. 1957  Charles Ehresmann–Jean Bénabou  Pointless topology building on Marshall Stone's work. 1957  Alexander Grothendieck  Abelian categories in homological algebra that combine exactness and linearity. 1957  Alexander Grothendieck  Influential Tohoku paper rewrites homological algebra; proving Grothendieck duality (Serre duality for possibly singular algebraic varieties). He also showed that the conceptual basis for homological algebra over a ring also holds for linear objects varying as sheaves over a space. 1957  Alexander Grothendieck  Grothendieck relative point of view, S-schemes. 1957  Alexander Grothendieck  Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem for smooth ; the proof introduces K-theory. 1957  Daniel Kan  Kan complexes: Simplicial sets (in which every horn has a filler) that are geometric models of simplicial ∞-groupoids. Kan complexes are also the fibrant (and cofibrant) objects of model categories of simplicial sets for which the fibrations are Kan fibrations. 1958  Alexander Grothendieck  Starts new foundation of algebraic geometry by generalizing varieties and other spaces in algebraic geometry to scheme which have the structure of a category with open subsets as objects and restrictions as morphisms.  form a category that is a Grothendieck topos, and to a scheme and even a stack one may associate a Zariski topos, an étale topos, a fppf topos, a fpqc topos, a Nisnevich topos, a flat topos, ... depending on the topology imposed on the scheme. The whole of algebraic geometry was categorized with time. 1958  Roger Godement  Monads in category theory (then called standard constructions and triples). Monads generalize classical notions from universal algebra and can in this sense be thought of as an algebraic theory over a category: the theory of the category of T-algebras. An algebra for a monad subsumes and generalizes the notion of a model for an algebraic theory. 1958  Daniel Kan  Adjoint functors. 1958  Daniel Kan  Limits in category theory. 1958  Alexander Grothendieck  Fibred categories. 1959  Bernard Dwork  Proves the rationality part of the Weil conjectures (the first conjecture). 1959  Jean-Pierre Serre  Algebraic K-theory launched by explicit analogy of ring theory with geometric cases. 1960  Alexander Grothendieck  Fiber functors 1960  Daniel Kan  Kan extensions 1960  Alexander Grothendieck  Formal algebraic geometry and formal schemes 1960  Alexander Grothendieck  Representable functors 1960  Alexander Grothendieck  Categorizes Galois theory (Grothendieck galois theory) 1960  Alexander Grothendieck  Descent theory: An idea extending the notion of gluing in topology to scheme to get around the brute equivalence relations. It also generalizes localization in topology 1961  Alexander Grothendieck  Local cohomology. Introduced at a seminar in 1961 but the notes are published in 1967 1961  Jim Stasheff  Associahedra later used in the definition of weak n-categories 1961  Richard Swan  Shows there is a 1-1 correspondence between topological vector bundles over a compact Hausdorff space X and finitely generated projective modules over the ring C(X) of continuous functions on X (Serre–Swan theorem) 1963  Frank Adams–Saunders Mac Lane  PROP categories and PACT categories for higher homotopies. PROPs are categories for describing families of operations with any number of inputs and outputs. Operads are special PROPs with operations with only one output 1963  Alexander Grothendieck  Étale topology, a special Grothendieck topology on  1963  Alexander Grothendieck  Étale cohomology 1963  Alexander Grothendieck  Grothendieck toposes, which are categories which are like universes (generalized spaces) of sets in which one can do mathematics 1963  William Lawvere  Algebraic theories and algebraic categories 1963  William Lawvere  Founds Categorical logic, discovers internal logics of categories and recognizes its importance and introduces Lawvere theories. Essentially categorical logic is a lift of different logics to being internal logics of categories. Each kind of category with extra structure corresponds to a system of logic with its own inference rules. A Lawvere theory is an algebraic theory as a category with finite products and possessing a \"generic algebra\" (a generic group). The structures described by a Lawvere theory are models of the Lawvere theory 1963  Jean-Louis Verdier  Triangulated categories and triangulated functors. Derived categories and derived functors are special cases of these 1963  Jim Stasheff  A∞-algebras: dg-algebra analogs of topological monoids associative up to homotopy appearing in topology (i.e. H-spaces) 1963  Jean Giraud  Giraud characterization theorem characterizing Grothendieck toposes as categories of sheaves over a small site 1963  Charles Ehresmann  Internal category theory: Internalization of categories in a category V with pullbacks is replacing the category Set (same for classes instead of sets) by V in the definition of a category. Internalization is a way to rise the categorical dimension 1963  Charles Ehresmann  Multiple categories and multiple functors 1963  Saunders Mac Lane  Monoidal categories also called tensor categories: Strict 2-categories with one object made by a relabelling trick to categories with a tensor product of objects that is secretly the composition of morphisms in the 2-category. There are several object in a monoidal category since the relabelling trick makes 2-morphisms of the 2-category to morphisms, morphisms of the 2-category to objects and forgets about the single object. In general a higher relabelling trick works for n-categories with one object to make general monoidal categories. The most common examples include: ribbon categories, braided tensor categories, spherical categories, compact closed categories, symmetric tensor categories, modular categories, autonomous categories, categories with duality 1963  Saunders Mac Lane  Mac Lane coherence theorem for determining commutativity of diagrams in monoidal categories 1964  William Lawvere  ETCS Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets: An axiomatization of the category of sets which is also the constant case of an elementary topos 1964  Barry Mitchell–Peter Freyd  Mitchell–Freyd embedding theorem: Every small abelian category admits an exact and full embedding into the category of (left) modules ModR over some ring R 1964  Rudolf Haag–Daniel Kastler  Algebraic quantum field theory after ideas of Irving Segal 1964  Alexander Grothendieck  Topologizes categories axiomatically by imposing a Grothendieck topology on categories which are then called sites. The purpose of sites is to define coverings on them so sheaves over sites can be defined. The other \"spaces\" one can define sheaves for except topological spaces are locales 1964  Michael Artin–Alexander Grothendieck  ℓ-adic cohomology, technical development in SGA4 of the long-anticipated Weil cohomology. 1964  Alexander Grothendieck  Proves the Weil conjectures except the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis 1964  Alexander Grothendieck  Six operations formalism in homological algebra; Rf*, f−1, Rf!, f!, ⊗L, RHom, and proof of its closedness 1964  Alexander Grothendieck   Introduced in a letter to Jean-Pierre Serre conjectural motives (algebraic geometry) to express the idea that there is a single universal cohomology theory underlying the various cohomology theories for algebraic varieties. According to Grothendieck's philosophy there should be a universal cohomology functor attaching a pure motive h(X) to each smooth projective variety X. When X is not smooth or projective h(X) must be replaced by a more general mixed motive which has a weight filtration whose quotients are pure motivess. The category of motives (the categorical framework for the universal cohomology theory) may be used as an abstract substitute for singular cohomology (and rational cohomology) to compare, relate and unite \"motivated\" properties and parallel phenomena of the various cohomology theories and to detect topological structure of algebraic varieties. The categories of pure motives and of mixed motives are abelian tensor categories and the category of pure motives is also a Tannakian category. Categories of motives are made by replacing the category of varieties by a category with the same objects but whose morphisms are correspondences, modulo a suitable equivalence relation. Different equivalences give different theories. Rational equivalence gives the category of Chow motives with Chow groups as morphisms which are in some sense universal. Every geometric cohomology theory is a functor on the category of motives. Each induced functor ρ:motives modulo numerical equivalence→graded Q-vector spaces is called a realization of the category of motives, the inverse functors are called improvements. Mixed motives explain phenomena in as diverse areas as: Hodge theory, algebraic K-theory, polylogarithms, regulator maps, automorphic forms, L-functions, ℓ-adic representations, trigonometric sums, homotopy of algebraic varieties, algebraic cycles, moduli spaces and thus has the potential of enriching each area and of unifying them all. 1965  Edgar Brown  Abstract homotopy categories: A proper framework for the study of homotopy theory of CW-complexes 1965  Max Kelly  dg-categories 1965  Max Kelly–Samuel Eilenberg  Enriched category theory: Categories C enriched over a category V are categories with Hom-sets HomC not just a set or class but with the structure of objects in the category V. Enrichment over V is a way to rise the categorical dimension 1965  Charles Ehresmann  Defines both strict 2-categories and strict n-categories 1966  Alexander Grothendieck  Crystals (a kind of sheaf used in crystalline cohomology) 1966  William Lawvere  ETAC Elementary theory of abstract categories, first proposed axioms for Cat or category theory using first order logic 1967  Jean Bénabou  Bicategories (weak 2-categories) and weak 2-functors 1967  William Lawvere  Founds synthetic differential geometry 1967  Simon Kochen–Ernst Specker  Kochen–Specker theorem in quantum mechanics 1967  Jean-Louis Verdier  Defines derived categories and redefines derived functors in terms of derived categories 1967  Peter Gabriel–Michel Zisman  Axiomatizes simplicial homotopy theory 1967  Daniel Quillen  Quillen Model categories and Quillen model functors: A framework for doing homotopy theory in an axiomatic way in categories and an abstraction of homotopy categories in such a way that hC = C[W−1] where W−1 are the inverted weak equivalences of the Quillen model category C. Quillen model categories are homotopically complete and cocomplete, and come with a built-in Eckmann–Hilton duality 1967  Daniel Quillen  Homotopical algebra (published as a book and also sometimes called noncommutative homological algebra): The study of various model categories and the interplay between fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences in arbitrary closed model categories 1967  Daniel Quillen  Quillen axioms for homotopy theory in model categories 1967  Daniel Quillen  First fundamental theorem of simplicial homotopy theory: The category of simplicial sets is a (proper) closed (simplicial) model category 1967  Daniel Quillen  Second fundamental theorem of simplicial homotopy theory: The realization functor and the singular functor is an equivalence of categories hΔ and hTop (Δ the category of simplicial sets) 1967  Jean Bénabou  V-actegories: A category C with an action ⊗ :V × C → C which is associative and unital up to coherent isomorphism, for V a symmetric monoidal category. V-actegories can be seen as the categorification of R-modules over a commutative ring R 1968  Chen-Ning Yang-Rodney Baxter  Yang-Baxter equation, later used as a relation in braided monoidal categories for crossings of braids 1968  Alexander Grothendieck  Crystalline cohomology: A p-adic cohomology theory in characteristic p invented to fill the gap left by étale cohomology which is deficient in using mod p coefficients for this case. It is sometimes referred to by Grothendieck as the yoga of de Rham coefficients and Hodge coefficients since crystalline cohomology of a variety X in characteristic p is like de Rham cohomology mod p of X and there is an isomorphism between de Rham cohomology groups and Hodge cohomology groups of harmonic forms 1968  Alexander Grothendieck  Grothendieck connection 1968  Alexander Grothendieck  Formulates the standard conjectures on algebraic cycles 1968  Michael Artin  Algebraic spaces in algebraic geometry as a generalization of Scheme 1968  Charles Ehresmann  Sketches (category theory): An alternative way of presenting a theory (which is categorical in character as opposed to linguistic) whose models are to study in appropriate categories. A sketch is a small category with a set of distinguished cones and a set of distinguished cocones satisfying some axioms. A model of a sketch is a set-valued functor transforming the distinguished cones into limit cones and the distinguished cocones into colimit cones. The categories of models of sketches are exactly the accessible categories 1968  Joachim Lambek  Multicategories 1969  Max Kelly-Nobuo Yoneda  Ends and coends 1969  Pierre Deligne-David Mumford  Deligne-Mumford stacks as a generalization of scheme 1969  William Lawvere  Doctrines (category theory), a doctrine is a monad on a 2-category 1970  William Lawvere-Myles Tierney  Elementary toposes: Categories modeled after the category of sets which are like universes (generalized spaces) of sets in which one can do mathematics. One of many ways to define a topos is: a properly cartesian closed category with a subobject classifier. Every Grothendieck topos is an elementary topos 1970  John Conway  Skein theory of knots: The computation of knot invariants by skein modules. Skein modules can be based on quantum invariants\n\n1971–1980\n\n Year Contributors Event 1971  Saunders Mac Lane  Influential book: Categories for the Working Mathematician, which became the standard reference in category theory 1971  Horst Herrlich-Oswald Wyler  Categorical topology: The study of topological categories of structured sets (generalizations of topological spaces, uniform spaces and the various other spaces in topology) and relations between them, culminating in universal topology. General categorical topology study and uses structured sets in a topological category as general topology study and uses topological spaces. Algebraic categorical topology tries to apply the machinery of algebraic topology for topological spaces to structured sets in a topological category. 1971  Harold Temperley-Elliott Lieb  Temperley–Lieb algebras: Algebras of tangles defined by generators of tangles and relations among them 1971  William Lawvere–Myles Tierney  Lawvere–Tierney topology on a topos 1971  William Lawvere–Myles Tierney  Topos theoretic forcing (forcing in toposes): Categorization of the set theoretic forcing method to toposes for attempts to prove or disprove the continuum hypothesis, independence of the axiom of choice, etc. in toposes 1971  Bob Walters-Ross Street  Yoneda structures on 2-categories 1971  Roger Penrose  String diagrams to manipulate morphisms in a monoidal category 1971  Jean Giraud  Gerbes: Categorified principal bundles that are also special cases of stacks 1971  Joachim Lambek  Generalizes the Haskell-Curry-William-Howard correspondence to a three way isomorphism between types, propositions and objects of a cartesian closed category 1972  Max Kelly  Clubs (category theory) and coherence (category theory). A club is a special kind of 2-dimensional theory or a monoid in Cat/(category of finite sets and permutations P), each club giving a 2-monad on Cat 1972  John Isbell  Locales: A \"generalized topological space\" or \"pointless spaces\" defined by a lattice (a complete Heyting algebra also called a Brouwer lattice) just as for a topological space the open subsets form a lattice. If the lattice possess enough points it is a topological space. Locales are the main objects of pointless topology, the dual objects being frames. Both locales and frames form categories that are each other's opposite. Sheaves can be defined over locales. The other \"spaces\" one can define sheaves over are sites. Although locales were known earlier John Isbell first named them 1972  Ross Street  Formal theory of monads: The theory of monads in 2-categories 1972  Peter Freyd  Fundamental theorem of topos theory: Every slice category (E,Y) of a topos E is a topos and the functor f*:(E,X)→(E,Y) preserves exponentials and the subobject classifier object Ω and has a right and left adjoint functor 1972  Alexander Grothendieck  Grothendieck universes for sets as part of foundations for categories 1972  Jean Bénabou–Ross Street  Cosmoses (category theory) which categorize universes: A cosmos is a generalized universe of 1-categories in which you can do category theory. When set theory is generalized to the study of a Grothendieck topos, the analogous generalization of category theory is the study of a cosmos.\n Ross Street definition: A bicategory such that\n small bicoproducts exist;\n each monad admits a Kleisli construction (analogous to the quotient of an equivalence relation in a topos);\n it is locally small-cocomplete; and\n there exists a small Cauchy generator.\nCosmoses are closed under dualization, parametrization and localization. Ross Street also introduces elementary cosmoses.\n\nJean Bénabou definition: A bicomplete symmetric monoidal closed category 1972  Peter May  Operads: An abstraction of the family of composable functions of several variables together with an action of permutation of variables. Operads can be seen as algebraic theories and algebras over operads are then models of the theories. Each operad gives a monad on Top. Multicategories with one object are operads. PROPs generalize operads to admit operations with several inputs and several outputs. Operads are used in defining opetopes, higher category theory, homotopy theory, homological algebra, algebraic geometry, string theory and many other areas. 1972  William Mitchell-Jean Bénabou  Mitchell-Bénabou internal language of a toposes: For a topos E with subobject classifier object Ω a language (or type theory) L(E) where: 1) the types are the objects of E 2) terms of type X in the variables xi of type Xi are polynomial expressions φ(x1,...,xm):1→X in the arrows xi:1→Xi in E 3) formulas are terms of type Ω (arrows from types to Ω) 4) connectives are induced from the internal Heyting algebra structure of Ω 5) quantifiers bounded by types and applied to formulas are also treated 6) for each type X there are also two binary relations =X (defined applying the diagonal map to the product term of the arguments) and ∈X (defined applying the evaluation map to the product of the term and the power term of the arguments). A formula is true if the arrow which interprets it factor through the arrow true:1→Ω. The Mitchell-Bénabou internal language is a powerful way to describe various objects in a topos as if they were sets and hence is a way of making the topos into a generalized set theory, to write and prove statements in a topos using first order intuitionistic predicate logic, to consider toposes as type theories and to express properties of a topos. Any language L also generates a linguistic topos E(L) 1973  Chris Reedy  Reedy categories: Categories of \"shapes\" that can be used to do homotopy theory. A Reedy category is a category R equipped with a structure enabling the inductive construction of diagrams and natural transformations of shape R. The most important consequence of a Reedy structure on R is the existence of a model structure on the functor category MR whenever M is a model category. Another advantage of the Reedy structure is that its cofibrations, fibrations and factorizations are explicit. In a Reedy category there is a notion of an injective and a surjective morphism such that any morphism can be factored uniquely as a surjection followed by an injection. Examples are the ordinal α considered as a poset and hence a category. The opposite R° of a Reedy category R is a Reedy category. The simplex category Δ and more generally for any simplicial set X its category of simplices Δ/X is a Reedy category. The model structure on MΔ for a model category M is described in an unpublished manuscript by Chris Reedy 1973  Kenneth Brown–Stephen Gersten  Shows the existence of a global closed model structure on the categegory of simplicial sheaves on a topological space, with weak assumptions on the topological space 1973  Kenneth Brown  Generalized sheaf cohomology of a topological space X with coefficients a sheaf on X with values in Kans category of spectra with some finiteness conditions. It generalizes generalized cohomology theory and sheaf cohomology with coefficients in a complex of abelian sheaves 1973  William Lawvere  Finds that Cauchy completeness can be expressed for general enriched categories with the category of generalized metric spaces as a special case. Cauchy sequences become left adjoint modules and convergence become representability 1973  Jean Bénabou  Distributors (also called modules, profunctors, directed bridges) 1973  Pierre Deligne  Proves the last of the Weil conjectures, the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis 1973  Michael Boardman-Rainer Vogt  Segal categories: Simplicial analogues of A∞-categories. They naturally generalize simplicial categories, in that they can be regarded as simplicial categories with composition only given up to homotopy.\nDef: A simplicial space X such that X0 (the set of points) is a discrete simplicial set and the Segal map\nφk : Xk → X1 ×  X 0 ... ×  X 0X1 (induced by X(αi):Xk → X1) assigned to X is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets for k≥2.\n\nSegal categories are a weak form of S-categories, in which composition is only defined up to a coherent system of equivalences.\nSegal categories were defined one year later implicitly by Graeme Segal. They were named Segal categories first by William Dwyer–Daniel Kan–Jeffrey Smith 1989. In their famous book Homotopy invariant algebraic structures on topological spaces J. Michael Boardman and Rainer Vogt called them quasi-categories. A quasi-category is a simplicial set satisfying the weak Kan condition, so quasi-categories are also called weak Kan complexes 1973  Daniel Quillen  Frobenius categories: An exact category in which the classes of injective and projective objects coincide and for all objects x in the category there is a deflation P(x)→x (the projective cover of x) and an inflation x→I(x) (the injective hull of x) such that both P(x) and I(x) are in the category of pro/injective objects. A Frobenius category E is an example of a model category and the quotient E/P (P is the class of projective/injective objects) is its homotopy category hE 1974  Michael Artin  Generalizes Deligne–Mumford stacks to Artin stacks 1974  Robert Paré  Paré monadicity theorem: E is a topos→E° is monadic over E 1974  Andy Magid  Generalizes Grothendiecks Galois theory from groups to the case of rings using Galois groupoids 1974  Jean Bénabou  Logic of fibred categories 1974  John Gray  Gray categories with Gray tensor product 1974  Kenneth Brown  Writes a very influential paper that defines Browns categories of fibrant objects and dually Brown categories of cofibrant objects 1974  Shiing-Shen Chern–James Simons  Chern–Simons theory: A particular TQFT which describe knot and manifold invariants, at that time only in 3D 1975  Saul Kripke–André Joyal  Kripke–Joyal semantics of the Mitchell–Bénabou internal language for toposes: The logic in categories of sheaves is first order intuitionistic predicate logic 1975  Radu Diaconescu  Diaconescu theorem: The internal axiom of choice holds in a topos → the topos is a boolean topos.

More precisely a coherent category C such that for all morphisms f:A→B in C the functor f*:SubC(B)→SubC(A) has a left adjoint and a right adjoint. SubC(A) is the preorder of subobjects of A (the full subcategory of C/A whose objects are subobjects of A) in C. Every topos is a logos.

It is a generalization of classical set theory, in which sets are replaced by terms of certain types. The category C(S) built out of a local theory S whose objects are the local sets (or S-sets) and whose arrows are the local maps (or S-maps) is a linguistic topos. Every topos E is equivalent to a linguistic topos C(S(E)) 1977  John Roberts  Introduces most general nonabelian cohomology of ω-categories with ω-categories as coefficients when he realized that general cohomology is about coloring simplices in ω-categories. There are two methods of constructing general nonabelian cohomology, as nonabelian sheaf cohomology in terms of descent for ω-category valued sheaves, and in terms of homotopical cohomology theory which realizes the cocycles. The two approaches are related by codescent 1978  John Roberts  Complicial sets (simplicial sets with structure or enchantment) 1978  Francois Bayen–Moshe Flato–Chris Fronsdal–Andre Lichnerowicz–Daniel Sternheimer  Deformation quantization, later to be a part of categorical quantization 1978  André Joyal  Combinatorial species in enumerative combinatorics 1978  Don Anderson  Building on work of Kenneth Brown defines ABC (co)fibration categories for doing homotopy theory and more general ABC model categories, but the theory lies dormant until 2003. Every Quillen model category is an ABC model category. A difference to Quillen model categories is that in ABC model categories fibrations and cofibrations are independent and that for an ABC model category MD is an ABC model category. To an ABC (co)fibration category is canonically associated a (left) right Heller derivator. Topological spaces with homotopy equivalences as weak equivalences, Hurewicz cofibrations as cofibrations and Hurewicz fibrations as fibrations form an ABC model category, the Hurewicz model structure on Top.

The point is that the categories of representations of quantum groups are tensor categories with extra structure. They are used in construction of quantum invariants of knots and links and low-dimensional manifolds, representation theory, q-deformation theory, CFT, integrable systems. The invariants are constructed from braided monoidal categories that are categories of representations of quantum groups.

It is a category in which one has in addition to composition a unary operation reciprocation R° and a partial binary operation intersection R ∩ S, like in the category of sets with relations as morphisms (instead of functions) for which a number of axioms are required. It generalizes the relation algebra to relations between different sorts. 1990  Nicolai Reshetikhin–Vladimir Turaev–Edward Witten  Reshetikhin–Turaev–Witten invariants of knots from modular tensor categories of representations of quantum groups.\n\n1991–2000\n Year Contributors Event 1991  Jean-Yves Girard  Polarization of linear logic. 1991  Ross Street  Parity complexes.

A stands for associative.\nDef: A category C such that\n1) for all X,Y in Ob(C) the Hom-sets HomC(X,Y) are finite-dimensional chain complexes of Z-graded modules\n2) for all objects X1,...,Xn in Ob(C) there is a family of linear composition maps (the higher compositions)\nmn : HomC(X0,X1) ⊗ HomC(X1,X2) ⊗ ... ⊗ HomC(Xn−1,Xn) → HomC(X0,Xn) of degree n − 2 (homological grading convention is used) for n ≥ 1\n3) m1 is the differential on the chain complex HomC(X,Y)\n4) mn satisfy the quadratic A∞-associativity equation for all n ≥ 0.\n\nm1 and m2 will be chain maps but the compositions mi of higher order are not chain maps; nevertheless they are Massey products. In particular it is a linear category.\n\nExamples are the Fukaya category Fuk(X) and loop space ΩX where X is a topological space and A∞-algebras as A∞-categories with one object.\n\nWhen there are no higher maps (trivial homotopies) C is a dg-category. Every A∞-category is quasiisomorphic in a functorial way to a dg-category. A quasiisomorphism is a chain map that is an isomorphism in homology.\n\nThe framework of dg-categories and dg-functors is too narrow for many problems, and it is preferable to consider the wider class of A∞-categories and A∞-functors. Many features of A∞-categories and A∞-functors come from the fact that they form a symmetric closed multicategory, which is revealed in the language of comonads. From a higher-dimensional perspective A∞-categories are weak ω-categories with all morphisms invertible. A∞-categories can also be viewed as noncommutative formal dg-manifolds with a closed marked subscheme of objects. 1993  John Barret-Bruce Westbury  Spherical categories: Monoidal categories with duals for diagrams on spheres instead for in the plane. 1993  Maxim Kontsevich  Kontsevich invariants for knots (are perturbation expansion Feynman integrals for the Witten functional integral) defined by the Kontsevich integral.

It was developed from 1988 by André Joyal and Ieke Moerdijk, and was first presented in detail as a book in 1995 by them. AST is a framework based on category theory to study and organize set theories and to construct models of set theories. The aim of AST is to provide a uniform categorical semantics or description of set theories of different kinds (classical or constructive, bounded, predicative or impredicative, well-founded or non-well-founded,...), the various constructions of the cumulative hierarchy of sets, forcing models, sheaf models and realisability models. Instead of focusing on categories of sets AST focuses on categories of classes. The basic tool of AST is the notion of a category with class structure (a category of classes equipped with a class of small maps (the intuition being that their fibres are small in some sense), powerclasses and a universal object (a universe)) which provides an axiomatic framework in which models of set theory can be constructed. The notion of a class category permits both the definition of ZF-algebras (Zermelo-Fraenkel algebra) and related structures expressing the idea that the hierarchy of sets is an algebraic structure on the one hand and the interpretation of the first order logic of elementary set theory on the other. The subcategory of sets in a class category is an elementary topos and every elementary topos occurs as sets in a class category. The class category itself always embeds into the ideal completion of a topos. The interpretation of the logic is that in every class category the universe is a model of basic intuitionistic set theory BIST that is logically complete with respect to class category models. Therefore, class categories generalize both topos theory and intuitionistic set theory. AST founds and formalizes set theory on the ZF-algebra with operations union and successor (singleton) instead of on the membership relation. The ZF-axioms are nothing but a description of the free ZF-algebra just as the Peano axioms are a description of the free monoid on one generator. In this perspective the models of set theory are algebras for a suitably presented algebraic theory and many familiar set theoretic conditions (such as well foundedness) are related to familiar algebraic conditions (such as freeness). Using an auxiliary notion of small map it is possible to extend the axioms of a topos and provide a general theory for uniformly constructing models of set theory out of toposes. 1995  Michael Makkai  SFAM Structuralist foundation of abstract mathematics. In SFAM the universe consists of higher-dimensional categories, functors are replaced by saturated anafunctors, sets are abstract sets, the formal logic for entities is FOLDS (first-order logic with dependent sorts) in which the identity relation is not given a priori by first order axioms but derived from within a context. 1995  John Baez-James Dolan  Opetopic sets (opetopes) based on operads. Weak n-categories are n-opetopic sets. 1995  John Baez-James Dolan  Introduced the periodic table of mathematics which identifies k-tuply monoidal n-categories. It mirrors the table of homotopy groups of the spheres. 1995  John Baez–James Dolan  Outlined a program in which n-dimensional TQFTs are described as n-category representations. 1995  John Baez–James Dolan  Proposed n-dimensional deformation quantization. 1995  John Baez–James Dolan  Tangle hypothesis: The n-category of framed n-tangles in n + k dimensions is (n + k)-equivalent to the free weak k-tuply monoidal n-category with duals on one object. 1995  John Baez-James Dolan  Cobordism hypothesis (Extended TQFT hypothesis I): The n-category of which n-dimensional extended TQFTs are representations, nCob, is the free stable weak n-category with duals on one object. 1995  John Baez-James Dolan  Stabilization hypothesis: After suspending a weak n-category n + 2 times, further suspensions have no essential effect. The suspension functor S:nCatk→nCatk+1 is an equivalence of categories for k = n + 2. 1995  John Baez-James Dolan  Extended TQFT hypothesis II: An n-dimensional unitary extended TQFT is a weak n-functor, preserving all levels of duality, from the free stable weak n-category with duals on one object to nHilb. 1995  Valentin Lychagin  Categorical quantization 1995  Pierre Deligne-Vladimir Drinfeld-Maxim Kontsevich  Derived algebraic geometry with derived schemes and derived moduli stacks. A program of doing algebraic geometry and especially moduli problems in the derived category of schemes or algebraic varieties instead of in their normal categories. 1997  Maxim Kontsevich  Formal deformation quantization theorem: Every Poisson manifold admits a differentiable star product and they are classified up to equivalence by formal deformations of the Poisson structure. 1998  Claudio Hermida-Michael-Makkai-John Power  Multitopes, Multitopic sets. 1998  Carlos Simpson  Simpson conjecture:  Every weak ∞-category is equivalent to a ∞-category in which composition and exchange laws are strict and only the unit laws are allowed to hold weakly. It is proven for 1,2,3-categories with a single object. 1998  André Hirschowitz-Carlos Simpson  Give a model category structure on the category of Segal categories. Segal categories are the fibrant-cofibrant objects and Segal maps are the weak equivalences. In fact they generalize the definition to that of a Segal n-category and give a model structure for Segal n-categories for any n ≥ 1. 1998  Chris Isham–Jeremy Butterfield  Kochen–Specker theorem in topos theory of presheaves: The spectral presheaf (the presheaf that assigns to each operator its spectrum) has no global elements (global sections) but may have partial elements or local elements. A global element is the analogue for presheaves of the ordinary idea of an element of a set. This is equivalent in quantum theory to the spectrum of the C*-algebra of observables in a topos having no points. 1998  Richard Thomas  Richard Thomas, a student of Simon Donaldson, introduces Donaldson–Thomas invariants which are systems of numerical invariants of complex oriented 3-manifolds X, analogous to Donaldson invariants in the theory of 4-manifolds. They are certain weighted Euler characteristics of the moduli space of sheaves on X and \"count\" Gieseker semistable coherent sheaves with fixed Chern character on X. Ideally the moduli spaces should be a critical sets of holomorphic Chern–Simons functions and the Donaldson–Thomas invariants should be the number of critical points of this function, counted correctly. Currently such holomorphic Chern–Simons functions exist at best locally. 1998  John Baez  Spin foam models: A 2-dimensional cell complex with faces labeled by representations and edges labeled by intertwining operators. Spin foams are functors between spin network categories. Any slice of a spin foam gives a spin network. 1998  John Baez–James Dolan  Microcosm principle: Certain algebraic structures can be defined in any category equipped with a categorified version of the same structure. 1998  Alexander Rosenberg  Noncommutative schemes: The pair (Spec(A),OA) where A is an abelian category and to it is associated a topological space Spec(A) together with a sheaf of rings OA on it. In the case when A = QCoh(X) for X a scheme the pair (Spec(A),OA) is naturally isomorphic to the scheme (XZar,OX) using the equivalence of categories QCoh(Spec(R))=ModR. More generally abelian categories or triangulated categories or dg-categories or A∞-categories should be regarded as categories of quasicoherent sheaves (or complexes of sheaves) on noncommutative schemes. This is a starting point in noncommutative algebraic geometry. It means that one can think of the category A itself as a space. Since A is abelian it allows to naturally do homological algebra on noncommutative schemes and hence sheaf cohomology. 1998  Maxim Kontsevich  Calabi–Yau categories: A linear category with a trace map for each object of the category and an associated symmetric (with respects to objects) nondegenerate pairing to the trace map. If X is a smooth projective Calabi—Yau variety of dimension d then Db(Coh(X)) is a unital Calabi–Yau A∞-category of Calabi–Yau dimension d. A Calabi–Yau category with one object is a Frobenius algebra. 1999  Joseph Bernstein–Igor Frenkel–Mikhail Khovanov  Temperley–Lieb categories: Objects are enumerated by nonnegative integers. The set of homomorphisms from object n to object m is a free R-module with a basis over a ring R. R is given by the isotopy classes of systems of (|n| + |m|)/2 simple pairwise disjoint arcs inside a horizontal strip on the plane that connect in pairs |n| points on the bottom and |m| points on the top in some order. Morphisms are composed by concatenating their diagrams. Temperley–Lieb categories are categorized Temperley–Lieb algebras. 1999  Moira Chas–Dennis Sullivan  Constructs string topology by cohomology.

The topology on a space is treated not as a lattice, but as an exponential object of the same category as the original space, with an associated λ-calculus. Every expression in the λ-calculus denotes both a continuous function and a program. ASD does not use the category of sets, but the full subcategory of overt discrete objects plays this role (an overt object is the dual to a compact object), forming an arithmetic universe (pretopos with lists) with general recursion.\n\n2001–present\n Year Contributors Event 2001  Charles Rezk  Constructs a model category with certain generalized Segal categories as the fibrant objects, thus obtaining a model for a homotopy theory of homotopy theories.

More precisely this object is a commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category endowed with a notion of equivalences which are understood as \"up-to-homotopy monoid\" (e.g. E∞-rings). 2002  Peter Johnstone  Influential book: sketches of an elephant – a topos theory compendium. It serves as an encyclopedia of topos theory (2/3 volumes published as of 2008). 2002  Dennis Gaitsgory-Kari Vilonen-Edward Frenkel  Proves the geometric Langlands program for GL(n) over finite fields. 2003  Denis-Charles Cisinski  Makes further work on ABC model categories and brings them back into light. From then they are called ABC model categories after their contributors. 2004  Dennis Gaitsgory  Extended the proof of the geometric Langlands program to include GL(n) over C. This allows to consider curves over C instead of over finite fields in the geometric Langlands program. 2004  Mario Caccamo  Formal category theoretical expanded λ-calculus for categories. 2004  Francis Borceux-Dominique Bourn  Homological categories 2004  William Dwyer-Philips Hirschhorn-Daniel Kan-Jeffrey Smith  Introduces in the book: Homotopy limit functors on model categories and homotopical categories, a formalism of homotopical categories and homotopical functors (weak equivalence preserving functors) that generalize the model category formalism of Daniel Quillen. A homotopical category has only a distinguished class of morphisms (containing all isomorphisms) called weak equivalences and satisfy the two out of six axiom. This allow to define homotopical versions of initial and terminal objects, limit and colimit functors (that are computed by local constructions in the book), completeness and cocompleteness, adjunctions, Kan extensions and universal properties. 2004  Dominic Verity  Proves the Street-Roberts conjecture. 2004  Ross Street  Definition of the descent weak ω-category of a cosimplicial weak ω-category. 2004  Ross Street  Characterization theorem for cosmoses: A bicategory M is a cosmos iff there exists a base bicategory W such that M is biequivalent to ModW. W can be taken to be any full subbicategory of M whose objects form a small Cauchy generator. 2004  Ross Street-Brian Day  Quantum categories and quantum groupoids: A quantum category over a braided monoidal category V is an object R with an opmorphism h:Rop ⊗ R → A into a pseudomonoid A such that h* is strong monoidal (preserves tensor product and unit up to coherent natural isomorphisms) and all R, h and A lie in the autonomous monoidal bicategory Comod(V)co of comonoids. Comod(V)=Mod(Vop)coop. Quantum categories were introduced to generalize Hopf algebroids and groupoids. A quantum groupoid is a Hopf algebra with several objects. 2004  Stephan Stolz-Peter Teichner  Definition of nD QFT of degree p parametrized by a manifold. 2004  Stephan Stolz-Peter Teichner  Graeme Segal proposed in the 1980s to provide a geometric construction of elliptic cohomology (the precursor to tmf) as some kind of moduli space of CFTs. Stephan Stolz and Peter Teichner continued and expanded these ideas in a program to construct TMF as a moduli space of supersymmetric Euclidean field theories. They conjectured a Stolz-Teichner picture (analogy) between classifying spaces of cohomology theories in the chromatic filtration (de Rham cohomology,K-theory,Morava K-theories) and moduli spaces of supersymmetric QFTs parametrized by a manifold (proved in 0D and 1D). 2005  Peter Selinger  Dagger categories and dagger functors. Dagger categories seem to be part of a larger framework involving n-categories with duals. 2005  Peter Ozsváth-Zoltán Szabó  Knot Floer homology 2006  P. Carrasco-A.R. Garzon-E.M. Vitale  Categorical crossed modules 2006  Aslak Bakke Buan–Robert Marsh–Markus Reineke–Idun Reiten–Gordana Todorov  Cluster categories: Cluster categories are a special case of triangulated Calabi–Yau categories of Calabi–Yau dimension 2 and a generalization of cluster algebras. 2006  Jacob Lurie  Monumental book: Higher topos theory: In its 940 pages Jacob Lurie generalizes the common concepts of category theory to higher categories and defines n-toposes, ∞-toposes, sheaves of n-types, ∞-sites, ∞-Yoneda lemma and proves Lurie characterization theorem for higher-dimensional toposes. Luries theory of higher toposes can be interpreted as giving a good theory of sheaves taking values in ∞-categories. Roughly an ∞-topos is an ∞-category which looks like the ∞-category of all homotopy types. In a topos mathematics can be done. In a higher topos not only mathematics can be done but also \"n-geometry\", which is higher homotopy theory. The topos hypothesis is that the (n+1)-category nCat is a Grothendieck (n+1)-topos. Higher topos theory can also be used in a purely algebro-geometric way to solve various moduli problems in this setting. 2006  Marni Dee Sheppeard  Quantum toposes 2007  Bernhard Keller-Thomas Hugh  d-cluster categories 2007  Dennis Gaitsgory-Jacob Lurie  Presents a derived version of the geometric Satake equivalence and formulates a geometric Langlands duality for quantum groups.\nThe geometric Satake equivalence realized the category of representations of the Langlands dual group LG in terms of spherical perverse sheaves (or D-modules) on the affine Grassmannian GrG = G((t))/G[[t]] of the original group G. 2008  Ieke Moerdijk-Clemens Berger  Extends and improved the definition of Reedy category to become invariant under equivalence of categories. 2008  Michael J. Hopkins–Jacob Lurie  Sketch of proof of Baez-Dolan tangle hypothesis and Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis which classify extended TQFT in all dimensions.\n\nSee also\n EGA\n FGA\n SGA\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n nLab, just as a higher-dimensional Wikipedia, started in late 2008; see nLab\n Zhaohua Luo; Categorical geometry homepage\n John Baez, Aaron Lauda; A prehistory of n-categorical physics\n Ross Street; An Australian conspectus of higher categories\n Elaine Landry, Jean-Pierre Marquis; Categories in context: historical, foundational, and philosophical\n Jim Stasheff; A survey of cohomological physics\n John Bell; The development of categorical logic\n Jean Dieudonné; The historical development of algebraic geometry\n Charles Weibel; History of homological algebra\n Peter Johnstone; The point of pointless topology\n Jim Stasheff; The pre-history of operads \n George Whitehead; Fifty years of homotopy theory\n Haynes Miller; The origin of sheaf theory\n\nCategory:Category theory\nCategory:Higher category theory\nCategory theory and related mathematics"

Botany, Zoology, Philosophy, Biology1763 Bayes' theorem named for Thomas Bayes who first suggested using the theorem to update beliefs was significantly edited and updated by Richard Price after the death of Thomas Bayes and read at the Royal Society. This would later serve as foundation of Bayesian inference in statisticsPhilosophy & statistics1767 James Denham-Steuart: used the term supply and demand in his on economics in Inquiry into the Principles of Political economy, published in 1767.

Keynes instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Economics, Sociology, Philosophy1931 Friedrich Hayek elaborated the \"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\". He argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates.Economics, Sociology, Philosophy1931 Kurt Gödel stated the incompleteness theorem which states that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the axioms. Philosophy, Mathematics, Logic1934 James Chadwick: Discovery of the neutronPhysics & Philosophy1934 Karl Popper emphasized the idea of falsifiability as the criterion demarcating science from non-science.Philosophy & Science1937 Alan Turing: Introduced the mathematical concept of a Turing machinePhilosophy, mathematics, psychology & computer science1937 Kurt Lewin: on the basis of Herbert Blumer's interactionist perspective, suggested that neither nature (inborn tendencies) nor nurture (how experiences in life shape individuals) alone can account for individuals' behavior and personalities, but rather that both nature and nurture interact to shape each person.  This is expressed as Lewin's Equation for behavior B=ƒ(P,E).  Earlier he coined the notion of genidentity,Lewin, K. (1922). Der Begriff der Genese in Physik, Biologie und Entwicklungsgeschichte. (Lewin's Habilitationsschrift) Psychology, philosophy, sociology, management, organizational behavior1940s Benjamin Lee Whorf brought focus to the Principle of linguistic relativityScience and linguistics\" first published in 1940 in MIT Technology Review (42:229-31) which implies that the structure of a language affects the weltanschauung or worldview of the speakers of the language and their cognition of the world.Carroll, John B. (ed.) (1956). Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf. Cambridge, Mass.: Technology Press of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. . Whorf's works tried to show that there is relationship between language and thought. The idea was introduced earlier by Humboldt and then worked on by Edward Sapir in the 1920s.Cognitive science, Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy1942 Joseph Schumpeter introduced the idea creative destruction, sometimes known as \"Schumpeter's gale\" in his work Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942), where in he described the way in which capitalist economic development arises out of the destruction of some prior economic order. Economics, Sociology, Philosophy1943 Oswald Avery proves that DNA is the genetic material of the chromosomeBiology, Genetics & Life sciences1943 Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch wrote the seminal paper entitled \"A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\" (1943) and proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network. Their work also presented ideas drawn upon the work of Leibniz with later implications for cellular automata. Philosophy, Cognitive science, Artificial Intelligence & Psychology1944 John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam: introduced the mathematical idea of a cellular automata. This set the foundations for the later discipline of complexity science and agent based modeling Philosophy, Mathematics, psychology, dynamical systems, computer science1944 John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern: wrote the seminal book Theory of games and economic behavior and began the interdisciplinary research field of game theoryPhilosophy, Mathematics, psychology, economics1947 William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain invent the first transistorelectronics & electrical engineering1948 Claude Elwood Shannon & Warren Weaver: 'A mathematical theory of communication' a seminal paper in Information theory.Information Theory, Mathematics & Cognitive sciences1948Norbert Wiener: introduced the concept of Cybernetics in his work Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine.Mathematical philosophy, artificial intelligence and beginning of cybernetics1948 Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Freeman Dyson: Quantum electrodynamicsPhysics & Philosophy1950 Ludwig von Bertalanffy began General systems theory with his publication  \"An Outline of General System Theory\" in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science Vol. 1 (No. 2)Systems science, Cybernetics, Mathematics & Cognitive sciences1950s Kenneth Arrow, Gérard Debreu and Lionel W. McKenzie introduced the modern conception of general equilibrium in economics. Gerard Debreu presents this model in Theory of Value (1959). Though an earlier form of general equilibrium was presented by Leon Walras in 1874. Economics, Sociology, Philosophy1950s Leon Festinger developed the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison Theory, and discovered nature of the role of propinquity in the formation of social ties while also making other contributions to the study of social networks, psychological social psychology and sociological social psychology.Psychology, sociology, Philosophy1951 John Bowlby developed attachment theory which states that human individuals, especially as children, needs to develop a stable and long lasting relationship with at least one primary caregiver for social and emotional development to occur normally. Relationships later in life are built on this primary foundation. The theory states that in human evolution, attachment behaviour increased the chances of survival. Psychology, Human development, sociology, philosophy, cognitive sciences1952 Jonas Salk: developed and tested first polio vaccinemedicine, biology and vaccination1953 Crick and Watson: helical structure of DNA, basis for molecular biologyBiology, Genetics, Life sciences and Philosophy1953 Anatol Rapoport introduced mathematical models in the study of information transmission in human interaction and for the management of conflict and cooperation in human life1953, \"Spread of information through a population with sociostructural bias: I.

Psychology, Philosophy, Cognitive sciences1956 Frank Harary and Dorwin Cartwright mathematically formalized generalizations of Fritz Heider's psychological theory of cognitive balance to give formalization of interpersonal network patterns. This laid the foundations for micro level social network analysis and small group research and group dynamics research in sociology and sociological social psychologyCartwright, Dorwin & Harary, Frank. (1956). \"Structural Balance: A Generalization of Heider's Theory.\" Psychological Review 63:277–293.Philosophy, sociological social psychology, mathematical sociology1957 Noam Chomsky: wrote Syntactic Structures which laid the foundation for the idea of transformational grammar. He also introduced the idea of poverty of the stimulus which states that natural language grammar is unlearnable given the relatively limited data available to children learning a language, and therefore that this knowledge is supplemented with some sort of innate linguistic capacity. A tenet of generative grammar. Philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science, computer science, psychology1957 Herbert Simon: coined the term Bounded rationality in psychology as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision making, as used in economics and related disciplines which views rationality as a maximization process as described in rational choice theory. Instead, \"bounded rationality\" views rationality as a Satisficing process.1957. Models of Man. John Wiley. Presents mathematical models of human behaviour. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978.Psychology, Management, Behavioral economics, Cognitive sciences, Philosophy1958 William Phillips, introduced Phillips curve in economic theory. He described the observation of an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the British economy over the period examined. In 1960 Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow took Phillips' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment: when inflation was high, unemployment was low, and vice versa.Economic theory, economics, sociology, philosophy1960s Paul Ekman conducted seminal research on the specific biological correlates of specific emotions, demonstrating the universality and discreteness of emotions in a Darwinian approach. This served as one of the basis for E. O. Wilson's works on Sociobiology in the 1970s and later helped in the emergence of the approach of Evolutionary Psychology in the 1990s through the work of Leda Cosmides and John ToobyPsychology, Anthropology, Sociology, Biology, Philosophy1962 Thomas Kuhn stated that scientific fields undergo periodic \"paradigm shifts\" rather than solely progressing in continuous way; which open up new approaches to understanding that scientists would never have considered valid before; and that the notion of scientific truth, at any given moment, cannot be established solely by objective criteria but is defined by a consensus of a scientific communityPhilosophy & Science1963Stanley Milgram first published a series of experiments now known as Milgram experiment which demonstrated how people showed obedience to orders in a social system when the orders were given by authority figures even when people were asked to perform actions against their wish and conscience. as PDF. The studies were done in order to explain conformity and obedience in society as seen during the Holocaust.Psychology, Sociology, Philosophy, Social Psych, Cognitive Sciences 1963 Lawrence Morley,  Fred Vine, and  Drummond Matthews:  Paleomagnetic stripes in ocean crust as evidence of plate tectonics (Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis).Geology1964Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig: postulate quarks leading to the standard modelPhysics & Philosophy1968Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson 1968 experimentally demonstrated Self fulfilling prophecy in social relationships through their field experiment which showed that if teachers were led to expect enhanced performance from some children, then those children did indeed show that enhancement. This is also known as Late bloomers effectPsychology, Social Psychology, Sociology, Philosophy1968–1970Terry Winograd made the artificial intelligence and natural language processing program SHRDLU that was concerned with the problem of providing a computer with sufficient \"understanding\" to be able to use natural language. Computer science, artificial intelligence, Psychology, Cognitive science1969 German computer pioneer Konrad Zuse published his book Calculating Space, proposing that the physical laws of the universe are discrete by nature, and that the entire universe is the output of a deterministic computation on a single cellular automaton; \"Zuse's Theory\" became the foundation of the field of study called digital physicsMathematics, Cognitive sciences, complexity theory, digital philosophy1969 invention of Internet\"Roads and Crossroads of Internet History\" by Gregory Gromov. 1995Information theory, Computer science, electrical engineering1970George Akerlof elaborated the idea of economic activity under asymmetric information. He described  information asymmetry, which occurs when the seller knows more about a product than the buyer. Later, Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz jointly received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001 for their work on economic behavior under asymmetric information.Economics, Cognitive economics, economic psychology, Philosophy1970John Horton Conway made the computer program Game of Life, also known simply as Life, a cellular automaton in which  its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game of life simulates the rise, fall and alterations of a society of living organisms.Mathematics, Computer science, agent based modeling, cognitive sciences, Philosophy1970s Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman published series of discoveries on the psychology of human judgment and decision making describing the pervasive nature of systematic human cognitive bias and handling of risk in everyday life.Tversky, A.; Kahneman, D.

Hamilton described the evolution of cooperation between cognitive entities and gave a mathematical and computational model describing the phenomenaPolitical science, Psychology, Computer science1986 David Rumelhart and James McClelland described the idea of Parallel Distributed Processing in modeling human cognition in psychology. They made mathematical and computational models of psychological information processing and described computer simulations of perception, giving testable models of neural information processing and introducing Connectionism.Psychology, Cognitive science, computer science, artificial intelligence1987 John C. Turner and Michael Hogg along with other colleagues developed the Self categorization theory which gives a  psychological theory for dynamics in group processes. It states that the self is not the foundational aspect of cognition, rather the self is a product of cognitive processes that occur in social processes. Earlier John Turner worked with Henri Tajfel (1979) on the precursor theory Social identity theory.Psychology, social psychology, Sociology, Philosophy1988 The concept of a Quantum cellular automata was introduced thus advancing quantum computation and quantum computerGrossing, G and Zeilinger, A (1988) Quantum cellular automata, Complex Systems (2) pp. 197–208 http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/02-2-4.pdfCellular automata, Computer science & Mathematics1970s–1988 Marvin Minsky & Seymour Papert started developing what came to be called The Society of Mind theory. They state how intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.Philosophy, Artificial intelligence, Cognitive science, Psychology Computer Sc1988 Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza reconstructed human evolution and migration patterns in human history in his work in population genetics.

    "text": "Club Atlético Unión (; mostly known as Unión de Santa Fe , CA Unión de Santa Fe or simply Unión) is a sports club from Santa Fe, the capital city of the Santa Fe Province, in Argentina. The club was founded in April 15, 1907 and plays in the Argentine Primera División.\n\nAlthough Unión is mostly known for its football team, that currently plays in Primera División, the club hosts other sports such as archery, basketball, field hockey, gymnastics, martial arts, roller skating, swimming and volleyball.\n\nHistory\nthumb|left|250px|Team of 1975 that made a great campaign in Primera División, finishing 4th\nIn 1965, the squad was promoted to the Segunda División Argentina for the first time. The team has played there for many years, alternating with periods in the second division. Unión's supporters are called \"unionistas\", \"tatengues\", while the squad is usually nicknamed \"El Tate\". The colours of the club consist of red and white vertical stripes.\n\nManaged by Juan Carlos Lorenzo in 1975, Unión made a great campaign in the 1975 championship with a group of notable players such as goalkeeper Hugo Gatti, midfielders Victorio Cocco and Rubén Suñé and forwards Ernesto Mastrángelo and Leopoldo Luque among others.A 40 años de la \"revolución\", El Litoral, 13 Feb 2015\n\nIn 1979 Unión played the final matches of the Nacional championship, but lost at the hands of River Plate, because the goal scored by River in the first match (with a final score of 1–1) ended up in an average over Union according to the away goals rule applied to that tournament.\n\nThe most famous footballers who played for Unión are Leopoldo Luque, World Cup winner with Argentina in 1978, and Nery Pumpido, the goalkeeper of the national team that won the World Cup in Mexico 1986.\n\nApart from football, basketball is the foremost sport practised at the institution, with Union's team currently in the third division. Carlos Delfino is its most famous basketball player, and Mario Elie, champion in NBA (1994, 1995 y 1999), also played briefly in the Argentine League, for Unión de Santa Fe.\n\nRivalry\n\nUnión and Colón are the two largest football clubs in Santa Fe. The Clásico Santafesino is known as one of football's fiercest and most important rivalries in Argentina. Unión and Colón have played 105 games all time against each other in the Professional Era, with Unión winning 37, Colón winning 31 and 37 draws.\n\nPlayers\nCurrent squad\n.\n\nOut on loan\n\nNotable players\n\nTo appear in this section a player must have played at least 50 games for the club and/or played officially for their national team.\n\n  Alberto Galateo (1927–34)\n  Julio Ávila (1948–49), (1955–56)\n  José Vicente Grecco (1949–53)\n  Victorio Cocco (1964–67)\n  Néstor Scotta (1967–69)\n  Mario Zanabria (1967–69)\n  Roberto Martínez (1970)\n  Leopoldo Luque (1971), (1973–75), (1980–81)\n  Hugo Gatti (1974–75)\n  Carlos Trullet (1974–77)\n  Rubén Suñé (1975)\n  Víctor Marchetti (1975–76), (1984)\n  Roberto Telch (1976–79)\n  Nery Pumpido (1976–81), (1991)\n  Carlos Trucco (1977–81), (1984–85)\n  Fernando Alí (1978–88)\n  Ramón Centurión (1978–85), (1991–92)\n  Osvaldo Escudero (1982–85)\n   Daniel Morón (1983–88)\n  Daniel Killer (1984–86)\n  Alberto Acosta (1986–88)\n  Ricardo Altamirano (1986–88)\n  Edgardo Arasa (1986–88)\n  Antony de Ávila (1987–88)\n  Claudio Borghi (1990–91)\n  Darío Cabrol (1990–92), (1994–00)\n  Ricardo Giusti (1991–92)\n  José Luis Marzo (1991–95), (1996–98)\n  Nii Lamptey (1997)\n  Danilo Aceval (1997–99)\n  Pablo Cavallero (1998–99)\n  Juan José Jayo (1998–00)\n  Daniel Noriega (1998–00), (2001–02)\n  Matías Donnet (1999–00), (2009–10)\n  Andrés Silvera (1999–01)\n  Daniel Tílger (1999–01)\n  Martín Zapata (1999–04), (2006–09)\n  Marcelo Mosset (1999–06), (2007–08)\n  Fernando Ortiz (2000–03)\n  Leonardo Fernández (2001)\n  Rubén Capria (2001–03)\n  Roberto Battión (2002–07)\n  Ignacio Canuto (2004–07)\n\nManagers\n\n Juan Carlos Lorenzo (1975–76)\n Reynaldo Volken (1977–79)\n Humberto Zucarelli (1988–90)\n Carlos Trullet (July 1990–Dec 91), (July 1995–June 98)\n Salvador Capitano (Jan 1999–June 99)\n Juan José López (1999)\n Nery Pumpido (July 1999–June 1)\n Leonardo Madelón (Jan 2001–Dec 01)\n Carlos Griguol (2002)\n Frank Kudelka (July 2002–Dec 02)\n Néstor Craviotto (July 2005–June 6)\n Carlos Trullet (July 2006–June 7)\n Fernando Quiroz (2008–09)\n Fernando Alí (Jul 2009–Jun 10)\n Frank Kudelka (June 2010–Sept 12)\n Nery Pumpido (Sept 2012–Dec 12)\n Facundo Sava (Dec 2012–Dec 13)\n Leonardo Madelón (Dec 2013–Nov 2016)\n Juan Pablo Pumpido (Nov 2016–Apr 2017)\n Pablo Marini (Apr 2017–Jun 2017)\n Leonardo Madelón (Jul 2017–)\n\nHonours\n\nNational\n Primera B (1): 1966\n\nRegional\nLiga Santafesina de Fútbol (36): 1915, 1917, 1919, 1920, 1924, 1926, 1928, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1942, 1953, 1954, 1955,  1956, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, Classificatorio 1971, Selectivo 1971, 1971, 1974, 1979, 1994, Apertura 2000, Apertura 2003, Apertura 2010\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nTatequerido \nTatengues.com \nMundo Rojiblanco \nLosTates \n\n \nCategory:Association football clubs established in 1907\nCategory:Football clubs in Santa Fe Province\nCategory:Basketball teams in Argentina\nCategory:Argentine field hockey clubs\nCategory:Argentine volleyball teams\nCategory:1907 establishments in Argentina"

    "text": "Wilhelm Friedrich Ackermann (; ; 29 March 1896 – 24 December 1962) was a German mathematician best known for the Ackermann function, an important example in the theory of computation.\n\nBiography\nAckermann was born in Herscheid, Germany, and was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Göttingen in 1925 for his thesis Begründung des \"tertium non datur\" mittels der Hilbertschen Theorie der Widerspruchsfreiheit, which was a consistency proof of arithmetic apparently without Peano induction (although it did use e.g. induction over the length of proofs). From 1929 until 1948, he taught at the Arnoldinum Gymnasium in Burgsteinfurt, and then at Lüdenscheid until 1961. He was also a corresponding member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften (Academy of Sciences) in Göttingen, and was an honorary professor at the University of Münster.\n\nIn 1928, Ackermann helped David Hilbert turn his 1917 – 22 lectures on introductory mathematical logic into a text, Principles of Mathematical Logic. This text contained the first exposition ever of first-order logic, and posed the problem of its completeness and decidability  (Entscheidungsproblem). Ackermann went on to construct consistency proofs for set theory (1937), full arithmetic (1940), type-free logic (1952), and a new axiomatization of set theory (1956).\n\nIn turn, Hilbert's support vanished when Ackermann got married:\n\nAckermann thus continued working as a high school teacher. Still, he kept continually engaged in research and published many contributions to the foundations of mathematics until the end of his life.  He died in Lüdenscheid, Germany.\n\nSee also\nAckermann coding\nAckermann ordinal\nAckermann set theory\nAckermann function\nInverse Ackermann function\n\nBibliography\n1928. \"On Hilbert's construction of the real numbers\" in Jean van Heijenoort, ed., 1967.

    "title": "Μ operator",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C_operator",
    "text": "In computability theory, the μ-operator, minimization operator, or unbounded search operator searches for the least natural number with a given property. Adding the μ-operator to the five primitive recursive operators makes it possible to define all computable functions.\n\n Definition \nSuppose that R(y, x1, ..., xk) is a fixed (k+1)-ary relation on the natural numbers. The μ-operator \"μy\", in either the unbounded or bounded form, is a \"number theoretic function\" defined from the natural numbers to the natural numbers. However, \"μy\" contains a predicate over the natural numbers that delivers true when the predicate is satisfied and false when it is not.\n\nThe bounded μ-operator appears earlier in Kleene (1952) Chapter IX Primitive Recursive Functions, §45 Predicates, prime factor representation as:\n\"\" (p. 225)\n\nStephen Kleene notes that any of the six inequality restrictions on the range of the variable y is permitted, i.e. y < z, y ≤ z, w < y < z, w < y ≤ z, w ≤ y < z and w ≤ y ≤ z. \"When the indicated range contains no y such that R(y) [is \"true\"], the value of the \"μy\" expression is the cardinal number of the range\" (p. 226); this is why the default \"z\" appears in the definition above. As shown below, the bounded μ-operator \"μyy<z\" is defined in terms of two primitive recursive functions called the finite sum Σ and finite product Π, a predicate function that \"does the test\" and a representing function that converts {t, f} to {0, 1}.\n\nIn Chapter XI §57 General Recursive Functions, Kleene defines the unbounded μ-operator over the variable y in the following manner,\n\"\" (p. 279, where \"\" means \"there exists a y such that...\")\n\nIn this instance R itself, or its representing function, delivers 0 when it is satisfied (i.e. delivers true); the function then delivers the number y. No upper bound exists on y, hence no inequality expressions appear in its definition.\n\nFor a given R(y) the unbounded μ-operator μyR(y) (note no requirement for \"(Ey)\" ) is a partial function. Kleene makes it as a total function instead (cf. p. 317):\n\nThe total version of the unbounded μ-operator is studied in higher-order reverse mathematics () in the following form:\n\nwhere the superscripts mean that n is zeroth-order, f is first-order, and μ is second-order. This axiom gives rise to the Big Five system ACA0 when combined with the usual base theory of higher-order reverse mathematics.\n\n Properties \n\n(i) In context of the primitive recursive functions, where the search variable y of the μ-operator is bounded, e.g. y < z in the formula below, if the predicate R is primitive recursive (Kleene Proof #E p. 228), then\n μyy<zR(y, x1, ..., xn) is a primitive recursive function.\n\n(ii) In the context of the (total) recursive functions, where the search variable y is unbounded but guaranteed to exist for all values xi of the total recursive predicate R's parameters,\n(x1),...,(xn) (Ey) R(y, xi, ..., xn) implies that μyR(y,  xi, ..., xn) is a total recursive function.\nHere (xi) means \"for all xi\" and Ey means \"there exists at least one value of y such that...\" (cf Kleene (1952) p. 279.)\n\nthen the five primitive recursive operators plus the unbounded-but-total μ-operator give rise to what Kleene called the \"general\" recursive functions (i.e. total functions defined by the six recursion operators).\n\n(iii) In the context of the partial recursive functions: Suppose that the relation R holds if and only if a partial recursive function converges to zero. And suppose that that partial recursive function converges (to something, not necessarily zero) whenever μyR(y, x1, ..., xk) is defined and y is μyR(y, x1, ..., xk) or smaller. Then the function μyR(y, x1, ..., xk) is also a partial recursive function.\n\nThe μ-operator is used in the characterization of the computable functions as the  μ recursive functions.\n\nIn constructive mathematics, the unbounded search operator is related to Markov's principle.\n\n Examples \n\n Example 1: The bounded μ-operator is a primitive recursive function \n\nIn the following x represents the string xi, ..., xn.\n\nThe bounded μ-operator  can be expressed rather simply in terms of two primitive recursive functions (hereafter \"prf\") that also are used to define the CASE function—the product-of-terms Π and the sum-of-terms Σ (cf Kleene #B page 224). (As needed, any boundary for the variable such as s ≤ t or t < z, or 5 < x < 17 etc. is appropriate). For example:\nΠs≤t fs(x, s) = f0(x, 0) × f1(x, 1) × ... × ft(x, t)\nΣt<z gt(x, t) = g0(x, 0) + g1(x, 1) + ... + gz-1(x, z-1)\n\nBefore we proceed we need to introduce a function ψ called \"the representing function\" of predicate R. Function ψ is defined from inputs (t = \"truth\", f = \"falsity\") to outputs (0, 1) (note the order!). In this case the input to ψ. i.e. {t, f}. is coming from the output of R:\n ψ(R = t) = 0\n ψ(R = f) = 1\n\nKleene demonstrates that μyy<zR(y) is defined as follows; we see the product function Π is acting like a Boolean OR operator, and the sum Σ is acting somewhat like a Boolean AND but is producing {Σ≠0, Σ=0} rather than just {1, 0}:\n  μyy<zR(y) = Σt<zΠs≤t ψ(R(x, t, s)) =\n [ψ(x, 0, 0)] +\n [ψ(x, 1, 0) × ψ(x, 1, 1)] +\n [ψ(x, 2, 0) × ψ(x, 2, 1) × ψ(x, 2, 2)] +\n ... +\n [ψ(x, z-1, 0) × ψ(x, z-1, 1) × ψ(x, z-1, 2) × . . . × ψ (x, z-1, z-1)]\n\nNote that Σ is actually a primitive recursion with the base Σ(x, 0) = 0 and the induction step Σ(x, y+1) = Σ(x, y) + Π( x, y). The product Π is also a primitive recursion with base step Π(x, 0) = ψ(x, 0) and induction step Π(x, y+1) = Π(x, y) × ψ(x, y+1).\n\nThe equation is easier if observed with an example, as given by Kleene. He just made up the entries for the representing function ψ(R(y)). He designated the representing functions χ(y) rather than ψ(x, y):\n y 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7=z χ(y) 1 1 1 0 1 0 0  π(y) = Πs≤y χ(s) 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 σ(y) = Σt<y π(t) 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 least y < z such that R(y) is \"true\":φ(y) = μyy<zR(y)    3    \n\n Example 2: The unbounded μ-operator is not primitive-recursive \nThe unbounded μ-operator—the function μy—is the one commonly defined in the texts. But the reader may wonder why the unbounded μ-operator is searching for a function R(x, y) to yield zero, rather than some other natural number.In a footnote Minsky does allow his operator to terminate when the function inside produces a match to the parameter \"k\"; this example is also useful because it shows another author's format:\"For μt[φ(t) = k]\" (p. 210)\n\nThe reason for zero is that the unbounded operator μy will be defined in terms of the function \"product\" Π with its index y allowed to \"grow\" as the μ-operator searches. As noted in the example above, the product Πx<y of a string of numbers ψ(x, 0) *, ..., * ψ(x, y) yields zero whenever one of its members ψ(x, i) is zero:\nΠs<y = ψ(x, 0) * , ..., * ψ(x, y) = 0\n\nif any ψ(x, i) = 0 where 0≤i≤s. Thus the Π is acting like a Boolean AND.\n\nThe function μy produces as \"output\" a single natural number y = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. However, inside the operator one of a couple \"situations\" can appear: (a) a \"number-theoretic function\" χ that produces a single natural number, or (b) a \"predicate\" R that produces either {t = true, f = false}. (And, in the context of partial recursive functions Kleene later admits a third outcome: \"μ = undecided\".pp. 332ff)\n\nKleene splits his definition of the unbounded μ-operator to handle the two situations (a) and (b). For situation (b), before the predicate R(x, y) can serve in an arithmetic capacity in the product Π, its output {t, f} must first be \"operated on\" by its representing function χ to yield {0, 1}. And for situation (a) if one definition is to be used then the number theoretic function χ must produce zero to \"satisfy\" the μ-operator. With this matter settled, he demonstrates with single \"Proof III\" that either types (a) or (b) together with the five primitive recursive operators yield the (total) recursive functions, with this proviso for a total function:\n For all parameters x, a demonstration must be provided to show that a y exists that satisfies (a) μyψ(x, y) or (b) μyR(x, y).\nKleene also admits a third situation (c) that does not require the demonstration of \"for all x a y exists such that ψ(x, y).\" He uses this in his proof that more total recursive functions exist than can be enumerated; c.f. footnote Total function demonstration.\n\nKleene's proof is informal and uses an example similar to the first example, but first he casts the μ-operator into a different form that uses the \"product-of-terms\" Π operating on function χ that yields a natural number n, which can be any natural number, and 0 in the instance when the u-operator's test is \"satisfied\".\n\nThe definition recast with the Π-function:\nμyy<zχ(y) =\n(i): π(x, y) = Πs<yχ(x, s)\n(ii): φ(x) = τ(π(x, y), π(x, y' ), y)\n(iii): τ(z' , 0, y) = y ;τ(u, v, w) is undefined for u = 0 or v > 0.\n\nThis is subtle. At first glance the equations seem to be using primitive recursion. But Kleene has not provided us with a base step and an induction step of the general form:\n base step: φ(0, x) = φ(x)\n induction step: φ(0, x) = ψ(y, φ(0,x), x)\n\nTo see what is going on, we first have to remind ourselves that we have assigned a parameter (a natural number) to every variable xi. Second, we do see a successor-operator at work iterating y (i.e. the y' ). And third, we see that the function μy y<zχ(y, x) is just producing instances of χ(y,x) i.e. χ(0,x), χ(1,x), ... until an instance yields 0. Fourth, when an instance χ(n, x) yields 0 it causes the middle term of τ, i.e. v = π(x, y' ) to yield 0. Finally, when the middle term v = 0, μyy<zχ(y) executes line (iii) and \"exits\". Kleene's presentation of equations (ii) and (iii) have been exchanged to make this point that line (iii) represents  an exit—an exit taken only when the search successfully finds a y to satisfy χ(y) and the middle product-term π(x, y' ) is 0; the operator then terminates its search with τ(z' , 0, y) = y.\n τ(π(x, y), π(x, y' ), y), i.e.:\n τ(π(x, 0), π(x, 1), 0),\n τ(π(x, 1), π(x, 2), 1)\n τ(π(x, 2), π(x, 3), 2)\n τ(π(x, 3), π(x, 4), 3)\n ... until a match occurs at y=n and then:\n τ(z' , 0, y) = τ(z' , 0, n) = n and the μ-operator's search is done.\n\nFor the example Kleene \"...consider[s] any fixed values of (xi, ..., xn) and write[s] simply 'χ(y)' for 'χ(xi, ..., xn), y)'\":\n y 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 etc. χ(y) 3 1 2 0 9 0 1 5  . . . π(y) = Πs≤yχ(s) 1 3 3 6 0 0 0 0  . . .    ↑      least y < z such that R(y) is \"true\":φ(y) = μyy<zR(y)    3     \n\n Example 3: Definition of the unbounded μ-operator in terms of an abstract machine \n\nBoth Minsky (1967) p. 21 and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) p. 60-61 provide definitions of the μ-operator as an abstract machine; see footnote Alternative definitions of μ.\n\nThe following demonstration follows Minsky without the \"peculiarity\" mentioned in the footnote. The demonstration will use a \"successor\" counter machine model closely related to the Peano Axioms and the primitive recursive functions. The model consists of (i) a finite state machine with a TABLE of instructions and a so-called 'state register' that we will rename \"the Instruction Register\" (IR), (ii) a few \"registers\" each of which can contain only a single natural number, and (iii) an instruction set of four \"commands\" described in the following table:\n\nIn the following, the symbolism \" [ r ] \"  means \"the contents of\", and \" →r \" indicates an action with respect to register r.\n\n Instruction Mnemonic Action on register(s) \"r\" Action on Instruction Register, IR CLeaR register CLR ( r ) 0 → r [ IR ] + 1 → IR INCrement register INC ( r ) [ r ] + 1 → r [ IR ] + 1 → IR Jump if Equal JE (r1, r2, z) none IF [ r1 ] = [ r2 ] THEN z → IR ELSE [ IR ] + 1 → IR Halt H none [ IR ]  → IR\n\nThe algorithm for the minimization operator μy[φ(x, y)] will, in essence, create a sequence of instances of the function φ(x, y) as the value of parameter y (a natural number) increases; the process will continue (see Note † below) until a match occurs between the output of function φ(x, y) and some pre-established number (usually 0). Thus the evaluation of φ(x, y) requires, at the outset, assignment of a natural number to each of its variables x and an assignment of a \"match-number\" (usually 0) to a register \"w\", and a number (usually 0) to register y.\n\nNote †: The unbounded μ-operator will continue this attempt-to-match process ad infinitum or until a match occurs. Thus the \"y\" register must be unbounded -- it must be able to \"hold\" a number of arbitrary size. Unlike a \"real\" computer model, abstract machine models allow this. In the case of a bounded μ-operator, a lower-bounded μ-operator would start with the contents of y set to a number other than zero. An upper-bounded μ-operator would require an additional register \"ub\" to contain the number that represents the upper bound plus an additional comparison operation; an algorithm could provide for both lower- and upper bounds.\n\nIn the following we are assuming that the Instruction Register (IR) encounters the μy \"routine\" at instruction number \"n\". Its first action will be to establish a number in a dedicated \"w\" register—an \"example of\" the number that function φ(x, y) must produce before the algorithm can terminate (classically this is the number zero, but see the footnote about the use of numbers other than zero). The algorithm's next action at instructiton \"n+1\" will be to clear the \"y\" register -- \"y\" will act as an \"up-counter\" that starts from 0. Then at instruction \"n+2\" the algorithm evaluates its function φ(x, y) -- we assume this takes j instructions to accomplish—and at the end of its evaluation φ(x, y) deposits its output in register \"φ\". At the (n+j+3)rd instruction the algorithm compares the number in the \"w\" register (e.g. 0) to the number in the \"φ\" register—if they are the same the algorithm has succeeded and it escapes through exit; otherwise it increments the contents of the \"y\" register and loops back with this new y-value to test function φ(x, y) again.\n\n IR Instruction Action on register Action on Instruction Register IR n μy[φ(x, y)]: CLR ( w ) 0 → w [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+1 CLR ( y ) 0 → y [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+2 loop: φ(x, y) φ([x], [y]) → φ [ IR ] + j + 1 → IR n+j+3 JE (φ, w, exit) none CASE: { IF [ φ ]=[ w ] THEN exit → IR ELSE [IR] + 1 → IR } n+j+4 INC ( y ) [ y ] + 1 → y [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+j+5 JE (0, 0, loop) Unconditional jump CASE: { IF [ r0 ] =[ r0 ] THEN loop → IR ELSE loop → IR } n+j+6 exit: etc.\n\n See also \nMcCarthy Formalism\n\n Footnotes \n\n Total function demonstration \n\nWhat is mandatory if the function is to be a total function is a demonstration by some other method (e.g. induction) that for each and every combination of values of its parameters xi some natural number y will satisfy the μ-operator so that the algorithm that represents the calculation can terminate:\n\"...we must always hesitate to assume that a system of equations really defines a general-recursive (i.e. total) function. We normally require auxiliary evidence for this, e.g. in the form of an inductive proof that, for each argument value, the computation terminates with a unique value.\" (Minsky (1967) p.186)\n\n\"In other words, we should not claim that a function is effectively calculable on the ground that it has been shown to be general (i.e. total) recursive, unless the demonstration that it is general recursive is effective.\"(Kleene (1952) p.319)\n\nFor an example of what this means in practice see the examples at mu recursive functions—even the simplest truncated subtraction algorithm \"x - y = d\" can yield, for the undefined cases when x < y, (1) no termination, (2) no numbers (i.e. something wrong with the format so the yield is not considered a natural number), or (3) deceit: wrong numbers in the correct format. The \"proper\" subtraction algorithm requires careful attention to all the \"cases\"\n(x, y) = {(0, 0), (a, 0), (0, b), (a≥b, b), (a=b, b), (a<b, b)}.\n\nBut even when the algorithm has been shown to produce the expected output in the instances {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)}, we are left with an uneasy feeling until we can devise a \"convincing demonstration\" that the cases (x, y) = (n, m) all yield the expected results. To Kleene's point: is our \"demonstration\" (i.e. the algorithm that is our demonstration) convincing enough to be considered effective?\n\n Alternative abstract machine models of the unbounded μ-operator from Minsky (1967) and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) \n\nThe unbounded μ-operator is defined by Minsky (1967) p. 210 but with a peculiar flaw: the-operator will not yield t=0 when its predicate (the IF-THEN-ELSE test) is satisfied; rather it yields t=2. In Minsky's version the counter is \"t\", and the function φ(t, x) deposits its number in register φ. In the usual μ definition register w will contain 0, but Minsky observes that it can contain any number k. Minsky's instruction set is equivalent to the following where \"JNE\" = Jump to z if Not Equal:\n{ CLR (r), INC (r), JNE (rj, rk, z) }\n\n IR Instruction Action on register Action on Instruction Register, IR n μyφ( x ):CLR ( w ) 0 → w [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+ 1  CLR ( t ) 0 → t [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+2 loop: φ (y, x) φ( [ t ], [ x ] ) → φ [ IR ] + j + 1 → IR n+j+3  INC ( t ) [ t ] + 1 → t [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+j+4  JNE (φ, w, loop) none CASE: {  IF [φ] ≠ [w] THEN \"exit\" → IR  ELSE [IR] + 1 → IR } n+j+5  INC ( t ) [ t ] + 1 → t [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+j+6 exit: etc.  \n\nThe unbounded μ-operator is also defined by Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) p. 60-61 for a counter machine with an instruction set equivalent to the following:\n { CLR (r), INC (r), DEC (r), JZ (r, z), H }\n\nIn this version the counter \"y\" is called \"r2\", and the function f( x, r2 ) deposits its number in register \"r3\". Perhaps the reason Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey clear r3 is to facilitate an unconditional jump to loop; this is often done by use of a dedicated register \"0\" that contains \"0\":\n\n IR Instruction Action on register Action on Instruction Register, IR n μr2[f(x, r2)]: CLR ( r2 ) 0 → r2 [ IR ] + 1 → IR  n+1 loop: f(y, x) f( [ t ], [ x ] ) → r3 [ IR ] + j + 1 → IR n+2 JZ ( r3, exit ) none IF [ r3 ] = 0 THEN exit → IR ELSE [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+j+3 CLR ( r3 ) 0 → r3 [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+j+4  INC ( r2 ) [ r2 ] + 1 → r2 [ IR ] + 1 → IR n+j+5  JZ ( r3, loop)  CASE: { IF [ r3 ] = 0 THEN loop → IR ELSE [IR] + 1 → IR } n+j+6 exit: etc.  \n\n References \n\nStephen Kleene (1952) Introduction to Metamathematics, North-Holland Publishing Company, New York, 11th reprint 1971: (2nd edition notes added on 6th reprint).\n \nMarvin L.

    "text": "In mathematical logic, an ω-consistent (or omega-consistent, also called numerically segregative)W.V.O. Quine (1971), Set Theory and its Logic. theory is a theory (collection of sentences) that is not only (syntactically) consistent (that is, does not prove a contradiction), but also avoids proving certain infinite combinations of sentences that are intuitively contradictory. The name is due to Kurt Gödel, who introduced the concept in the course of proving the incompleteness theorem.Smorynski, \"The incompleteness theorems\", Handbook of Mathematical Logic, 1977, p. 851.\n\n Definition \n\nA theory T is said to interpret the language of arithmetic if there is a translation of formulas of arithmetic into the language of T so that T is able to prove the basic axioms of the natural numbers under this translation.\n\nA T that interprets arithmetic is ω-inconsistent if, for some property P of natural numbers (defined by a formula in the language of T), T proves P(0), P(1), P(2), and so on (that is, for every standard natural number n, T proves that P(n) holds), but T also proves that there is some natural number n (necessarily nonstandard) such that P(n) fails. This may not generate a contradiction within T because T may not be able to prove for any specific value of n that P(n) fails, only that there is such an n.\n\nT is ω-consistent if it is not ω-inconsistent.\n\nThere is a weaker but closely related property of Σ1-soundness. A theory T is Σ1-sound (or 1-consistent, in another terminology) if every Σ01-sentenceThe definition of this symbolism can be found at arithmetical hierarchy. provable in T is true in the standard model of arithmetic N (i.e., the structure of the usual natural numbers with addition and multiplication).\nIf T is strong enough to formalize a reasonable model of computation, Σ1-soundness is equivalent to demanding that whenever T proves that a Turing machine C halts, then C actually halts. Every ω-consistent theory is Σ1-sound, but not vice versa.\n\nMore generally, we can define an analogous concept for higher levels of the arithmetical hierarchy. If Γ is a set of arithmetical sentences (typically Σ0n for some n), a theory T is Γ-sound if every Γ-sentence provable in T is true in the standard model. When Γ is the set of all arithmetical formulas, Γ-soundness is called just (arithmetical) soundness.\nIf the language of T consists only of the language of arithmetic (as opposed to, for example, set theory), then a sound system is one whose model can be thought of as the set ω, the usual set of mathematical natural numbers. The case of general T is different, see ω-logic below.\n\nΣn-soundness has the following computational interpretation: if the theory proves that a program C using a Σn−1-oracle halts, then C actually halts.\n\n Examples \n\n Consistent, ω-inconsistent theories \nWrite PA for the theory Peano arithmetic, and Con(PA) for the statement of arithmetic that formalizes the claim \"PA is consistent\". Con(PA) could be of the form \"For every natural number n, n is not the Gödel number of a proof from PA that 0=1\". (This formulation uses 0=1 instead of a direct contradiction; that gives the same result, because PA certainly proves ¬0=1, so if it proved 0=1 as well we would have a contradiction, and on the other hand, if PA proves a contradiction, then it proves anything, including 0=1.)\n\nNow, assuming PA is really consistent, it follows that PA + ¬Con(PA) is also consistent, for if it were not, then PA would prove Con(PA) (since an inconsistent theory proves every sentence), contradicting Gödel's second incompleteness theorem. However, PA + ¬Con(PA) is not ω-consistent. This is because, for any particular natural number n, PA + ¬Con(PA) proves that n is not the Gödel number of a proof that 0=1 (PA itself proves that fact; the extra assumption ¬Con(PA) is not needed). However, PA + ¬Con(PA) proves that, for some natural number n, n is the Gödel number of such a proof (this is just a direct restatement of the claim ¬Con(PA) ).\n\nIn this example, the axiom ¬Con(PA) is Σ1, hence the system PA + ¬Con(PA) is in fact Σ1-unsound, not just ω-inconsistent.\n\n Arithmetically sound, ω-inconsistent theories \n\nLet T be PA together with the axioms c ≠ n for each natural number n, where c is a new constant added to the language. Then T is arithmetically sound (as any nonstandard model of PA can be expanded to a model of T), but ω-inconsistent (as it proves , and c ≠ n for every number n).\n\nΣ1-sound ω-inconsistent theories using only the language of arithmetic can be constructed as follows. Let IΣn be the subtheory of PA with the induction schema restricted to Σn-formulas, for any n > 0. The theory IΣn + 1 is finitely axiomatizable, let thus A be its single axiom, and consider the theory T = IΣn + ¬A. We can assume that A is an instance of the induction schema, which has the form\n\nIf we denote the formula\n\nby P(n), then for every natural number n, the theory T (actually, even the pure predicate calculus) proves P(n). On the other hand, T proves the formula , because it is logically equivalent to the axiom ¬A. Therefore, T is ω-inconsistent.\n\nIt is possible to show that T is Πn + 3-sound. In fact, it is Πn + 3-conservative over the (obviously sound) theory IΣn. The argument is more complicated (it relies on the provability of the Σn + 2-reflection principle for IΣn in IΣn + 1).\n\n Arithmetically unsound, ω-consistent theories \n\nLet ω-Con(PA) be the arithmetical sentence formalizing the statement \"PA is ω-consistent\". Then the theory PA + ¬ω-Con(PA) is unsound (Σ3-unsound, to be precise), but ω-consistent. The argument is similar to the first example: a suitable version of the Hilbert-Bernays-Löb derivability conditions holds for the \"provability predicate\" ω-Prov(A) = ¬ω-Con(PA + ¬A), hence it satisfies an analogue of Gödel's second incompleteness theorem.\n\n ω-logic \n\nThe concept of theories of arithmetic whose integers are the true mathematical integers is captured by ω-logic.J. Barwise (ed.), Handbook of Mathematical Logic, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1977. Let T be a theory in a countable language which includes a unary predicate symbol N intended to hold just of the natural numbers, as well as specified names 0, 1, 2, ..., one for each (standard) natural number (which may be separate constants, or constant terms such as 0, 1, 1+1, 1+1+1, ..., etc.).  Note that T itself could be referring to more general objects, such as real numbers or sets; thus in a model of T the objects satisfying N(x) are those that T interprets as natural numbers, not all of which need be named by one of the specified names.\n\nThe system of ω-logic includes all axioms and rules of the usual first-order predicate logic, together with, for each T-formula P(x) with a specified free variable x, an infinitary ω-rule of the form:\nFrom  infer .\n\nThat is, if the theory asserts (i.e. proves) P(n) separately for each natural number n given by its specified name, then it also asserts P collectively for all natural numbers at once via the evident finite universally quantified counterpart of the infinitely many antecedents of the rule.  For a theory of arithmetic, meaning one with intended domain the natural numbers such as Peano arithmetic, the predicate N is redundant and may be omitted from the language, with the consequent of the rule for each P simplifying to .\n\nAn ω-model of T is a model of T whose domain includes the natural numbers and whose specified names and symbol N are standardly interpreted, respectively as those numbers and the predicate having just those numbers as its domain (whence there are no nonstandard numbers). If N is absent from the language then what would have been the domain of N is required to be that of the model, i.e. the model contains only the natural numbers.  (Other models of T may interpret these symbols nonstandardly; the domain of N need not even be countable, for example.)  These requirements make the ω-rule sound in every ω-model. As a corollary to the omitting types theorem, the converse also holds: the theory T has an ω-model if and only if it is consistent in ω-logic.\n\nThere is a close connection of ω-logic to ω-consistency. A theory consistent in ω-logic is also ω-consistent (and arithmetically sound). The converse is false, as consistency in ω-logic is a much stronger notion than ω-consistency. However, the following characterization holds: a theory is ω-consistent if and only if its closure under unnested applications of the ω-rule is consistent.\n\n Relation to other consistency principles \n\nIf the theory T is recursively axiomatizable, ω-consistency has the following characterization, due to C. Smoryński: Reviewed in \nT is ω-consistent if and only if  is consistent.\nHere,  is the set of all Π02-sentences valid in the standard model of arithmetic, and  is the uniform reflection principle for T, which consists of the axioms\n\nfor every formula  with one free variable. In particular, a finitely axiomatizable theory T in the language of arithmetic is ω-consistent if and only if T + PA is -sound.\n\n Notes \n\n Bibliography \n Kurt Gödel (1931).

Organized chronologically, beginning with Imhotep (entry \"[1]\") and concluding with Stephen Hawking (entry \"[1510]\"), each biographical entry is numbered, allowing for easy cross-referencing of one scientist with another. Nearly every biographical sketch contains links to other biographies. For example, the article about John Franklin Enders [1195] has the sentence \"Fleming's [1077] penicillin was available thanks to the work of Florey [1213] and Chain [1306]  . . .\" This allows one to quickly refer to the articles about Fleming, Florey, and Chain.   It includes scientists in all fields including biologists, chemists, astronomers, physicists, mathematicians, geologist, and explorers. The alphabetical list of biographical entries starts with  ABBE, Cleveland [738] and ends with ZWORYKIN, Vladimir Kosma [1134]\n\nIn the Second Revised Edition Isaac Newton receives the greatest coverage, a biography of seven pages. Galileo, Faraday and Einstein tie, with five pages each, and Lavoisier and Darwin get four pages each. Dutch writer Gerrit Krol said about the book, \"One of the charms of this encyclopedia is that to each name he adds those with whom this scientist has been in contact.\"  The book has been revised several times, by both Asimov himself, and most recently, by his daughter Robyn Asimov.\n\nEntries include\n\nEntry  NameField Notes1 ImhotepEngineering(2650–2600 BC) An Egyptian polymath, he is considered to be the first engineer, architect and physician in history known by name.2AhmoseMathematicsAlso known as Ahmes, an Egypt scribe of the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt who copied the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.3ThalesMathematics(624 – c. 546 BC), One of the Seven Sages of Greece.

    "title": "Aspergillus ochraceus",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_ochraceus",
    "text": "Aspergillus ochraceus is a mold species in the genus Aspergillus known to produce the toxin ochratoxin A, one of the most abundant food-contaminating mycotoxins, and citrinin. It also produces the dihydroisocoumarin mellein. It is a filamentous fungus in nature and has characteristic biseriate conidiophores.  Traditionally a soil fungus, has now began to adapt to varied ecological niches, like agricultural commodities, farmed animal and marine species. In humans and animals the consumption of this fungus produces chronic neurotoxic, immunosuppressive, genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. Its airborne spores are one of the potential causes of asthma in children and lung diseases in humans. The pig and chicken populations in the farms are the most affected by this fungus and its mycotoxins. Certain fungicides like mancozeb, copper oxychloride, and sulfur have inhibitory effects on the growth of this fungus and its mycotoxin producing capacities.\n\nHistory and related species\nThe genus Aspergillus was first described in 1729 by Pier Antonio Micheli. Under this genus the species Aspergillus ochraceus was discovered by the German botanist and mycologist Karl Adolf  Wilhelm in 1877. After this discovery, some other species that looked similar to Aspergillus ochraceus were considered synonyms of this fungus. For example, Aspergillus alutaceus isolated by Berkeley in 1875, Sterigmatocystis helva isolated by Bainier in 1881, Aspergillus ochraceus var. microspora isolated by Traboschi in 1908, and  Aspergillus Ochraceus- petali- formis isolated by Balista et Maia in 1957 are all considered synonyms of Aspergillus ochraceus. In 1979 two new species under the Aspergillus ochraceus group were discovered.Aspergillus bridgeri was isolated from soils collected in southcentral Wyoming and Aspergillus campestris from northcentral North Dakota.\n\nPhysiology\nThe colonies of Aspergillus ochraceus grow rapidly (45 to 55 mm in 7 days). The optimum temperature for their growth is 25 °C. In an agar plate the vegetative mycelium is mostly submerged in the agar, while the conidial heads are typically arranged in zones. The characteristic colour of the colony is yellow. Some colonies of Aspergillus ochraceus form pinkish to purple, irregular, pebble-like sclerotia up to 1 mm in diameter. The reverse look on a petri dish is pale to brownish.\n\nTo the naked eye, the conidiophores of Aspergillus ochraceus  appear as a powdery mass. Microscopically, smooth or finely roughened phialides are arranged on the conidial heads in a biseriate fashion (i.e., phialides are attached to intermediate cells called metulae, which in turn are attached to the vesicle). The metulae all around the perimeter grows in a radial orientation. In culture the conidial heads at first appear globose, but with age, the conidial chains adhere and develop into two or three divergent columns. Vinaceous purple sclerotia may be present. The characteristic colour of the conidiophores is chalky yellow to pale yellow-brown. The heights of the conidiophores are up to 1500 µm high. The appearances of these conidiophores are granular with pale yellow-brown walls that attach abruptly to a \"globose to subglobose vesicle\". The vesicles, which are globose with thin walls and a diameter of 35 × 50 µm, produce sterigmata over the entire surface in culture. The primary sterigmata measures 15-25 × 5-6 µm, while the secondaries are 7-11 × 2-3.3 µm. The conidia are arranged in dry, upright chains, often massing into two or more short columns per head, in wet microscopic mounts hyaline. The diameter of the conidia are around 2.5-3.5 µm.\n \nAspergillus ochraceus produces a mycotoxin named ochratoxin A (OTA). Mellein and 4-hydroxymellein are other toxic metabolites produced by this fungus.\n\nEcology\nThe ecological roots of Aspergillus ochraceus lay in the soil. This fungus was first isolated from varied soils. Evolutionary development has now well adapted Aspergillus ochraceus to occupy a great variety of environmental niches. It has been isolated from the marine alga Sargassum miyabei. This fungus has also been found in a wide variety of  agricultural commodities like corn, peanuts, cottonseed, rice, tree nuts, cereal grains, and fruits. Similarly the presence of this fungus has been documented in coffee beans Apart from the actual colonies of fungi growing on substances, the toxins and metabolites produced by this fungus have also been found in a variety of places. For example, the mycotoxin OTA produced by this fungus was found to be present in airborne dust. Likewise, secondary metabolites of this fungus have been isolated from marine sponges. This fungus has also been found to be associated with the contamination of an edible caterpillar, named the phane worm. In terms of climate preferences, this fungus has been found to mainly colonise temperate and tropical geographical areas.\n\nMycotoxin of importance in agriculture and farming\nOchratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin produced by A. ochraceus, contaminates food and initiates apoptosis of plant cells. Significant loss in nutritive value and hazardous effect on the food chain are caused due to the same OTA toxin contamination in barley grains of Spain. OTA has been isolated from plant acquired foods products like cereal, vegetables, coffee, wine, liquorice and also animal acquired food products like pork and poultry. Apart from being found in human food products from farm animals, this fungus was also isolated from the poultry feed. Aspergillus ochraceus produces both OTA and Penicillic acid in poultry feed at optimum temperatures and moisture levels. Combinations of low temperature and moisture favored the growth of Penicillic acid, on the other hand combinations of high temperature and moisture favored the growth of OTA. In addition to poulty and agricultural products the harvesting of edible insects is also an important economic activity. The rural population of Botswana eat a caterpillar called 'phane worm'. As already mentioned above, this lepidopteran larva is often contaminated by A. ochraceus.  So this fungus is also of economic importance in cultures that consume insects. Wineries are also subject to losses resulting from OTA contamination as a result of A. ochraceus grows on grapes, dried vine fruits and wine.\n\nIndustrial use\nAspergillus ochraceus was used for the industrial production of xylanase and β-xylosidase. In addition to producing enzymes, recently in a study done by Lee Ki in 2013, Aspergillus ochraceus  was found to inhibit the growth of a Shiga toxin-producing bacteria called Escherichia coli (STEC) O157, implicating industrial use of this phenomenon to develop anti-bacterial drugs. In another study pertaining to the conversion of Xanthohumol, a prenylated chalconoid, which has antioxidant and anticancer properties, Aspergillus ochraceus was found to be able to convert it into a stronger antioxidant, increasing the compounds radical scavenging properties. The process of fermentation was found to be enhanced by the addition of Aspergillus ochraceus  in the substrate mixture, which contained wheat bran and wheat straw liquor. The secondary metabolites of this fungus have shown to possess antibacterial activities that manifest the potential to inhibit human pathogens. For example, α- Campholene aldehyde, Lucenin-2 and 6-Ethyloct- 3-yl- 2- ethylhexyl ester are the three secondary metabolites that showed antimicrobial effects against potential human pathogens.\n\nEffects of human consumption\nThe consumption of OTA is found to have neurotoxic, immunosuppressive, genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects in humans. Toxicological studies have shown OTA to have strong carcinogenic mycotoxin effects on the liver and kidney of humans. Renal failure in human subjects have been reported after the inhalation of OTA. In addition to organ damage after inhalation of OTA, cases of allergy development have also been found. A disease named allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, has been found to be caused due to the antigenic effects of  Aspergillus ochraceus.  Aspergillus ochraceus was found to be associated with the development of asthma in children too. Cases of occupational environmental hazards are also documented, due to the presence of this fungus in organic dust of poultry industry. The workers in the poultry farm, subjected to this contaminated organic dust suffer from lung inflammation and decreased pulmonary function. In addition to lung diseases, instances of  Aspergillus ochraceus causing paranasal sinusitis have also been reported.\n\nAnimal diseases\nA 4-year-old male mixed breed dog was diagnosed with ear discharge due to A. ochraceus otitis. But the dog was treated with oral itraconazole and topical miconazole, which cured the dog after three weeks of medication.In a study, to test the toxicity of OTA in rats, a different dietary dose of OTA  was administered to male Fischer rats. Only chronic administration of OTA manifested as renal carcinogensis in these rats. Low levels of Aspergillus ochraceus contamination caused mycotoxic nephropathy in farm pigs and chickens from Bulgaria. Just as in Bulgaria, the mycotoxicoses produced by A. ochraceus is seen in chickens and other animals elsewhere. In this mycotoxicoses we see suppression of hemopoiesis, acute nephrosis, hepatic necrosis and enteritis. The mechanisms by which this fungus causes the nephrotoxicity in animals are cell apoptosis and lipid peroxidation. In the pig population this fungus has caused a number of diseases. Some of these diseased conditions are, subcutaneous edema, hydrothorax, hydroperitoneum, pulmonary atelectasis, edema of the mesentery and perirenal edema. The edema produced in these animals is so massive that ascites, hydrothorax, and hydropericardium develop, in addition to subcutaneous edena and mesenteric edema. Affected animals die within a few hours generally.In addition to these conditions, renal lesions have been reported, which consist of tubular degeneration, necrosis, hyaline tubular casts, interstitial fibrosis and tubular cell regeneration. Extensive interstitial fibrosis of the cortical labyrinth was another observation in the swine population. Bovine abortions have also been associated with A. ochraceus infection.\n\nTreatment and prevention\nFungicides like mancozeb, copper oxychloride, and sulfur inhibit Aspergillus ochraceus growth at appropriate doses, temperature and time. These fungicides also decrease the capacity of  this fungus to produce the mycotoxin OTA. Ozonated air can be used to prevent the growth of this fungus on foods products like sausages. In another study they found that, gamma irradiations are useful in the detoxification and inactivation of ochratoxin A (OTA). The ethonolic extracts from the bark of the tree Clausena heptaphylla, has shown to inhibit the growth of this fungus as well. Fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs), extracted from Linum usitatissimum seeds, have been found to reduce the radial hyphal growth of Aspergillus ochraceus, even though slightly less than \"Aspergillus flavus\". In a very similar fashion, some essential oils extracted from aromatic plants, have shown to have fungicidal effects on Aspergillus ochraceus that colonized pulses. In animals too, attempts have been made to cure (OTA) toxicosis. For example, in the White Leghorn cockerel, chronic haematological damage caused by (OTA) exposure can be reduced by exogenous supplementation using a combination of L-carnitine and vitamin E. Recently an alcohol producing yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to inhibit the growth of OTA. Transcriptional regulation of OTA biosynthetic gene was the inhibitory mechanism used by the bacteria to do so. Dietary exposure to OTA today is mainly a result of failures during processing and conservation procedures used by food industries. Improper agricultural technology, storage and transport practices as well as method of processing food are key checkpoints to avoid toxic consumption of OTA.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n AspergillusWeb\n Mycobank Record on Aspergillus ochraceus\n\nochraceus\nCategory:Fungi described in 1877"

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell%27s_philosophical_views",
    "text": "The aspects of Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy cover the changing viewpoints of philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), from his early writings in 1896 until his death in February 1970.\n\nPhilosophical work\nRussell is generally credited with being one of the founders of analytic philosophy, but he also produced a body of work that covers logic, the philosophy of mathematics, metaphysics, ethics and epistemology.\n\nAnalytic philosophy\nBertrand Russell helped to develop what is now called \"Analytic Philosophy.\" Alongside G. E. Moore, Russell was shown to be partly responsible for the British revolt against idealism, a philosophy greatly influenced by G. W. F. Hegel and his British apostle, F. H. Bradley. This revolt was echoed 30 years later in Vienna by the logical positivists' \"revolt against metaphysics.\" Russell was particularly critical of a doctrine he ascribed to idealism and coherentism, which he dubbed the doctrine of internal relations; this, Russell suggested, held that to know any particular thing, we must know all of its relations. Russell argued that this would make space, time, science and the concept of number not fully intelligible. Russell's logical work with Whitehead continued this project.\n\nRussell and Moore were devoted to clarity in arguments by breaking down philosophical position into their simplest components. Russell, in particular, saw formal logic and science as the principal tools of the philosopher. Russell did not think we should have separate methods for philosophy. Russell thought philosophers should strive to answer the most general of propositions about the world and this would help eliminate confusions. In particular, he wanted to end what he saw as the excesses of metaphysics. Russell adopted William of Ockham's principle against multiplying unnecessary entities, Occam's Razor, as a central part of the method of analysis.\n\nLogic and philosophy of mathematics\nRussell had great influence on modern mathematical logic. The American philosopher and logician Willard Quine said Russell's work represented the greatest influence on his own work.\"Quine, Willard Van Orman.\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed 23 February 2008.\n\nRussell's first mathematical book, An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry, was published in 1897. This work was heavily influenced by Immanuel Kant. Russell later realised that the conception it laid out would make Albert Einstein's schema of space-time impossible. Thenceforth, he rejected the entire Kantian program as it related to mathematics and geometry, and rejected his own earliest work on the subject.\n\nInterested in the definition of number, Russell studied the work of George Boole, Georg Cantor, and Augustus De Morgan. Materials in the Bertrand Russell Archives at McMaster University include notes of his reading in algebraic logic by Charles Sanders Peirce and Ernst Schröder.Bertrand Russell Archives at McMaster UniversityIrving H. Anellis, \"Schröder Material at the Russell Archives\", Modern Logic 1 (1990–1991), 237–247. In 1900 he attended the first International Congress of Philosophy in Paris, where he became familiar with the work of the Italian mathematician, Giuseppe Peano. He mastered Peano's new symbolism and his set of axioms for arithmetic. Peano defined logically all of the terms of these axioms with the exception of 0, number, successor, and the singular term, the, which were the primitives of his system. Russell took it upon himself to find logical definitions for each of these. Between 1897 and 1903 he published several articles applying Peano's notation to the classical Boole-Schröder algebra of relations, among them On the Notion of Order, Sur la logique des relations avec les applications à la théorie des séries, and On Cardinal Numbers. He became convinced that the foundations of mathematics could be derived within what has since come to be called higher-order logic which in turn he believed to include some form of unrestricted comprehension axiom.\n\nRussell then discovered that Gottlob Frege had independently arrived at equivalent definitions for 0, successor, and number, and the definition of number is now usually referred to as the Frege-Russell definition.Griffin, Nicholas ed. The Cambridge Companion to Bertrand Russell. Cambridge. 2003. p. 412 Russell drew attention to Frege's priority in 1903, when he published The Principles of Mathematics (see below).Russell's The Principles of Mathematics The appendix to this work, however, described a paradox arising from Frege's application of second- and higher-order functions which took first-order functions as their arguments, and Russell offered his first effort to resolve what would henceforth come to be known as the Russell Paradox. Before writing Principles, Russell became aware of Cantor's proof that there was no greatest cardinal number, which Russell believed was mistaken. The Cantor Paradox in turn was shown (for example by Crossley) to be a special case of the Russell Paradox. This caused Russell to analyse classes, for it was known that given any number of elements, the number of classes they result in is greater than their number. This in turn led to the discovery of a very interesting class, namely, the class of all classes. It contains two kinds of classes: those classes that contain themselves, and those that do not. Consideration of this class led him to find a fatal flaw in the so-called principle of comprehension, which had been taken for granted by logicians of the time. He showed that it resulted in a contradiction, whereby Y is a member of Y, if and only if, Y is not a member of Y. This has become known as Russell's paradox, the solution to which he outlined in an appendix to Principles, and which he later developed into a complete theory, the theory of types. Aside from exposing a major inconsistency in naive set theory, Russell's work led directly to the creation of modern axiomatic set theory. It also crippled Frege's project of reducing arithmetic to logic. The Theory of Types and much of Russell's subsequent work have also found practical applications with computer science and information technology.\n\nRussell continued to defend logicism, the view that mathematics is in some important sense reducible to logic, and along with his former teacher, Alfred North Whitehead, wrote the monumental Principia Mathematica, an axiomatic system on which all of mathematics can be built. The first volume of the Principia was published in 1910, and is largely ascribed to Russell. More than any other single work, it established the speciality of mathematical or symbolic logic. Two more volumes were published, but their original plan to incorporate geometry in a fourth volume was never realised, and Russell never felt up to improving the original works, though he referenced new developments and problems in his preface to the second edition. Upon completing the Principia, three volumes of extraordinarily abstract and complex reasoning, Russell was exhausted, and he felt his intellectual faculties never fully recovered from the effort.The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, the Early Years, p. 202. Although the Principia did not fall prey to the paradoxes in Frege's approach, it was later proven by Kurt Gödel that neither Principia Mathematica, nor any other consistent system of primitive recursive arithmetic, could, within that system, determine that every proposition that could be formulated within that system was decidable, i.e. could decide whether that proposition or its negation was provable within the system (See: Gödel's incompleteness theorem).\n\nRussell's last significant work in mathematics and logic, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, was written while he was in jail for his anti-war activities during World War I. This was largely an explication of his previous work and its philosophical significance.\n\nPhilosophy of language\nRussell made language, or more specifically, how we use language, a central part of philosophy, and this influenced Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gilbert Ryle, J. L. Austin, and P. F. Strawson, among others, who used many of the techniques that Russell originally developed. Russell, and GE Moore, argued that clarity of expression is a virtue.\n\nA significant contribution to philosophy of language is Russell's theory of descriptions, set out in On Denoting (Mind, 1905). Frank P. Ramsey described this paper as \"a paradigm of philosophy.\" The theory considers the sentence \"The present King of France is bald\" and whether the proposition is false or meaningless. Frege had argued, employing his distinction between sense and reference, that such sentences were meaningful but neither true nor false.  Russell argues that the grammatical form of the sentence disguises its underlying logical form.   Russell's Theory of Definite Descriptions enables the sentence to be construed as meaningful but false, without commitment to the existence of any present King of France. This addresses a paradox of great antiquity (e.g. \"That which is not must in some sense be. Otherwise, how could we say of it that it is not?\" etc.), going back at least as far as Parmenides.  In Russell's own time, Meinong held the view of that which is not being in some sense real; and Russell held this view prior to On Denoting.Principles of Mathematics (1903) pg. 449.\n\nThe problem is general to what are called \"definite descriptions.\" Normally this includes all terms beginning with \"the,\" and sometimes includes names, like \"Walter Scott.\" (This point is quite contentious: Russell sometimes thought that the latter terms shouldn't be called names at all, but only \"disguised definite descriptions,\" but much subsequent work has treated them as altogether different things.) What is the \"logical form\" of definite descriptions: how, in Frege's terms, could we paraphrase them to show how the truth of the whole depends on the truths of the parts? Definite descriptions appear to be like names that by their very nature denote exactly one thing, neither more nor less. What, then, are we to say about the proposition as a whole if one of its parts apparently isn't functioning correctly?\n\nRussell's solution was, first of all, to analyse not the term alone but the entire proposition that contained a definite description. \"The present king of France is bald,\" he then suggested, can be reworded to \"There is an x such that x is a present king of France, nothing other than x is a present king of France, and x is bald.\" Russell claimed that each definite description in fact contains a claim of existence and a claim of uniqueness which give this appearance, but these can be broken apart and treated separately from the predication that is the obvious content of the proposition. The proposition as a whole then says three things about some object: the definite description contains two of them, and the rest of the sentence contains the other. If the object does not exist, or if it is not unique, then the whole sentence turns out to be false, not meaningless.\n\nOne of the major complaints against Russell's theory, due originally to Strawson, is that definite descriptions do not claim that their object exists, they merely presuppose that it does.\n\nWittgenstein, Russell's student, achieved considerable prominence in the philosophy of language after the posthumous publication of the Philosophical Investigations. In Russell's opinion, Wittgenstein's later work was misguided, and he decried its influence and that of its followers (especially members of the so-called \"Oxford school\" of ordinary language philosophy, who he believed were promoting a kind of mysticism). He wrote a foreword to Ernest Gellner's Words and Things which was a fierce attack on the Oxford School of Ordinary Language philosophy and Wittgenstein's later work and was supportive of Gellner in the subsequent academic dispute. However, Russell still held Wittgenstein and his early work in high regard, he thought of him as, \"perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived, passionate, profound, intense, and dominating.\"The Autobio. of B. Russell, pg. 329. Russell's belief that philosophy's task is not limited to examining ordinary language is once again widely accepted in philosophy.\n\nLogical atomism\nRussell explained his philosophy of logical atomism in a set of lectures, \"The Philosophy of Logical Atomism\", which he gave in 1918. In these lectures, Russell sets forth his concept of an ideal, isomorphic language, one that would mirror the world, whereby our knowledge can be reduced to terms of atomic propositions and their truth-functional compounds. Logical atomism is a form of radical empiricism, for Russell believed the most important requirement for such an ideal language is that every meaningful proposition must consist of terms referring directly to the objects with which we are acquainted, or that they are defined by other terms referring to objects with which we are acquainted. Russell excluded some formal, logical terms such as all, the, is, and so forth, from his isomorphic requirement, but he was never entirely satisfied with our understanding of such terms. One of the central themes of Russell's atomism is that the world consists of logically independent facts, a plurality of facts, and that our knowledge depends on the data of our direct experience of them. In his later life, Russell came to doubt aspects of logical atomism, especially his principle of isomorphism, though he continued to believe that the process of philosophy ought to consist of breaking things down into their simplest components, even though we might not ever fully arrive at an ultimate atomic fact.\n\nEpistemology\nRussell's epistemology went through many phases. Once he shed neo-Hegelianism in his early years, Russell remained a philosophical realist for the remainder of his life, believing that our direct experiences have primacy in the acquisition of knowledge. While some of his views have lost favour, his influence remains strong in the distinction between two ways in which we can be familiar with objects: \"knowledge by acquaintance\" and \"knowledge by description\". For a time, Russell thought that we could only be acquainted with our own sense data—momentary perceptions of colours, sounds, and the like—and that everything else, including the physical objects that these were sense data of, could only be inferred, or reasoned to—i.e. known by description—and not known directly. This distinction has gained much wider application, though Russell eventually rejected the idea of an intermediate sense datum.\n\nIn his later philosophy, Russell subscribed to a kind of neutral monism, maintaining that the distinctions between the material and mental worlds, in the final analysis, were arbitrary, and that both can be reduced to a neutral property—a view similar to one held by the American philosopher/psychologist, William James, and one that was first formulated by Baruch Spinoza, whom Russell greatly admired. Instead of James' \"pure experience,\" however, Russell characterised the stuff of our initial states of perception as \"events,\" a stance which is curiously akin to his old teacher Whitehead's process philosophy.\n\nPhilosophy of science\nRussell claimed that he was more convinced of his method of doing philosophy than of his philosophical conclusions. Science was one of the principal components of analysis. Russell was a believer in the scientific method, that science reaches only tentative answers, that scientific progress is piecemeal, and attempts to find organic unities were largely futile. He believed the same was true of philosophy. Russell held that the ultimate objective of both science and philosophy was to understand reality, not simply to make predictions.\n\nRussell's work contributed to philosophy of science's development into a separate branch of philosophy. Much of Russell's thinking about science is expressed in his 1914 book, Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy, which influenced the logical positivists.\n\nRussell held that of the physical world we know only its abstract structure except for the intrinsic character of our own brain with which we have direct acquaintance (Russell, 1948). Russell saidin a lettera letter to Newman which has been reprinted in Russell's autobiography) that he had always assumed copunctuality between percepts and non-percepts, and percepts were also part of the physical world, a part of which we knew its intrinsic character directly, knowledge which goes beyond structure. His views on science have become integrated into the contemporary debate in the philosophy of science as a form of Structural Realism, people such as Elie Zahar and Ioannis Votsis have discussed the implications of his work for our understanding of science. The seminal article \"The Concept of Structure in The Analysis of Matter\" by William Demopoulos and Michael Friedman was crucial in reintegrating Russell's views to the contemporary scene.\n\nRussell wrote several science books, including The ABC of Atoms (1923) and The ABC of Relativity (1925).\n\nEthics\nWhile Russell wrote a great deal on ethical subject matters, he did not believe that the subject belonged to philosophy or that when he wrote on ethics that he did so in his capacity as a philosopher. In his earlier years, Russell was greatly influenced by G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica. Along with Moore, he then believed that moral facts were objective, but known only through intuition; that they were simple properties of objects, not equivalent (e.g., pleasure is good) to the natural objects to which they are often ascribed (see Naturalistic fallacy); and that these simple, undefinable moral properties cannot be analysed using the non-moral properties with which they are associated. In time, however, he came to agree with his philosophical hero, David Hume, who believed that ethical terms dealt with subjective values that cannot be verified in the same way as matters of fact.\n\nCoupled with Russell's other doctrines, this influenced the logical positivists, who formulated the theory of emotivism or non-cognitivism, which states that ethical propositions (along with those of metaphysics) were essentially meaningless and nonsensical or, at best, little more than expressions of attitudes and preferences. Notwithstanding his influence on them, Russell himself did not construe ethical propositions as narrowly as the positivists, for he believed that ethical considerations are not only meaningful, but that they are a vital subject matter for civil discourse. Indeed, though Russell was often characterised as the patron saint of rationality, he agreed with Hume, who said that reason ought to be subordinate to ethical considerations.\n\nIn terms of his normative ethical beliefs, Russell considered himself a utilitarianThe Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p. 39 (\"It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise. Belief in happiness, I found, was called Utilitarianism, and was merely one among a number of ethical theories. I adhered to it after this discovery.\"). early in his life.\n\nReligion and theology\nFor most of his adult life Russell maintained that religion is little more than superstition and, despite any positive effects that religion might have, it is largely harmful to people. He believed religion and the religious outlook (he considered communism and other systematic ideologies to be forms of religion) serve to impede knowledge, foster fear and dependency, and are responsible for much of the war, oppression, and misery that have beset the world.\n\nIn his 1949 speech, \"Am I an Atheist or an Agnostic?\", Russell expressed his difficulty over whether to call himself an atheist or an agnostic:\n\nHowever, in the 1948 BBC Radio Debate between Bertrand Russell and Frederick Copleston, Russell chose to assume the position of the agnostic, though it seems to have been because he admitted to not being able to prove the non-existence of God:\n\nThough he would later question God's existence, he fully accepted the ontological argument during his undergraduate years:\n\nThis quote has been used by many theologians over the years, such as by Louis Pojman in his Philosophy of Religion, who wish for readers to believe that even a well-known atheist-philosopher supported this particular argument for God's existence. However, elsewhere in his autobiography, Russell also mentions:\n\nRussell made an influential analysis of the omphalos hypothesis enunciated by Philip Henry Gosse—that any argument suggesting that the world was created as if it were already in motion could just as easily make it a few minutes old as a few thousand years: {{quote|There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that \"remembered\" a wholly unreal past. There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago.|Bertrand Russell|The Analysis of Mind, 1921, pp. 159–60; cf. Philosophy, Norton, 1927, p. 7, where Russell acknowledges Gosse's paternity of this anti-evolutionary argument. }}\n\nAs a young man, Russell had a decidedly religious bent, himself, as is evident in his early Platonism. He longed for eternal truths, as he makes clear in his famous essay, \"A Free Man's Worship\", widely regarded as a masterpiece of prose, but a work that Russell came to dislike. While he rejected the supernatural, he freely admitted that he yearned for a deeper meaning to life.\n\nRussell's views on religion can be found in his book, Why I Am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects. Its title essay was a talk given on 6 March 1927 at Battersea Town Hall, under the auspices of the South London Branch of the National Secular Society, UK, and published later that year as a pamphlet. The book also contains other essays in which Russell considers a number of logical arguments for the existence of God, including the first cause argument, the natural-law argument, the argument from design, and moral arguments. He also discusses specifics about Christian theology.\n\nHis conclusion:\n\nInfluence on philosophy\nAs Nicholas Griffin points out in the introduction to The Cambridge Companion to Bertrand Russell, Russell had a major influence on modern philosophy, especially in the English-speaking world. While others were also influential, notably Frege, Moore, and Wittgenstein, Russell made analysis the dominant methodology of professional philosophy. The various analytic movements throughout the last century all owe something to Russell's earlier works. Even Russell's biographer, the philosopher Ray Monk, no admirer of Russell's personal snobbery, characterised his work on the philosophy of mathematics as intense, august and incontestably greatMonk, Ray. The Ghost of Madness. Jonathan Cape. 2000. p. 5. and acknowledged, in the preface to the second volume of his biography, that he is one of the indisputably great philosophers of the twentieth century.\n\nRussell's influence on individual philosophers is singular, especially in the case of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who was his student between 1911 and 1914.\n\nWittgenstein had an important influence on Russell as he himself discusses in his My Philosophical Development. He led him, for example, to conclude, much to his regret, that mathematical truths were purely tautological truths, however it is doubtful that Wittgenstein actually held this view, which he discussed in relation to logical truth, since it is not clear that he was a logicist when he wrote the Tractatus. What is certain is that in 1901 Russell's own reflections on the issues raised by the paradox that takes his name Russell's paradox, led him to doubt the intuitive certainty of mathematics. This doubt was perhaps Russell's most important 'influence' on mathematics, and was spread throughout the European universities, even as Russell himself laboured (with Alfred North Whitehead) in an attempt to solve the Paradox and related paradoxes, such as Burali-Forti. As Stewart Shapiro explains in his Thinking About Mathematics, Russell's attempts to solve the paradoxes led to the ramified theory of types, which, though it is highly complex and relies on the doubtful axiom of reducibility, actually manages to solve both syntactic and semantic paradoxes at the expense of rendering the logicist project suspect and introducing much complexity in the PM system. Philosopher and logician F.P. Ramsey would later simplify the theory of types arguing that there was no need to solve both semantic and syntactic paradoxes to provide a foundation for mathematics. The philosopher and logician George Boolos discusses the power of the PM system in the preface to his Logic, logic & logic, stating that it is powerful enough to derive most classical mathematics, equating the power of PM to that of Z, a weaker form of set theory than ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory with Choice). In fact, ZFC actually does circumvent Russell's paradox by restricting the comprehension axiom to already existing sets by the use of subset axioms.Enderton, Herbert. Elements of Set Theory. Academic Press. 1977.\n\nRussell wrote (in Portraits from Memory, 1956) of his reaction to Gödel's 'Theorems of Undecidability':\n\nEvidence of Russell's influence on Wittgenstein can be seen throughout the Tractatus, which Russell was instrumental in having published. Russell also helped to secure Wittgenstein's doctorateThe Autobio. of B. Russell, pgs. 435–440. and a faculty position at Cambridge, along with several fellowships along the way.The Autobio. of B. Russell, pgs. 351–353.\nHowever, as previously stated, he came to disagree with Wittgenstein's later linguistic and analytic approach to philosophy dismissing it as \"trivial\", while Wittgenstein came to think of Russell as \"superficial and glib\", particularly in his popular writings. However, Norman Malcolm tells us in his recollections of Wittgenstein that Wittgenstein showed a deference towards Russell such as he never saw him show towards any one, and even went so far as to reprimand students of his who criticised Russell. As Ray Monk relates in his biography of Wittgenstein, Wittgenstein used to say that Russell's books should be bound in two covers, those dealing with mathematical philosophy in blue, and every student of philosophy should read them, while those dealing with popular subjects should be bound in red and no one should be allowed to read them.\n\nRussell's influence is also evident in the work of Alfred J. Ayer, Rudolf Carnap, Alonzo Church, Kurt Gödel, David Kaplan, Saul Kripke, Karl Popper, W. V. Quine, John R. Searle, and a number of other philosophers and logicians.\n\nRussell often characterised his moral and political writings as lying outside the scope of philosophy, but Russell's admirers and detractors are often more acquainted with his pronouncements on social and political matters, or what some (e.g., biographer Ray Monk) have called his \"journalism,\" than they are with his technical, philosophical work. There is a marked tendency to conflate these matters, and to judge Russell the philosopher on what he himself would definitely consider to be his non-philosophical opinions. Russell often cautioned people to make this distinction. Beginning in the 1920s, Russell wrote frequently for The Nation on changing morals, disarmament and literature. In 1965, he wrote that the magazine \"...has been one of the few voices which has been heard on behalf of individual liberty and social justice consistently throughout its existence.\"Katrina Vanden Heuvel The Nation 1865–1990, p. 136, Thunder's Mouth Press, 1990 \n\nRussell left a large assortment of writing. From his adolescent years, he wrote about 3,000 words a day, with relatively few corrections; his first draft nearly always was his last, even on the most complex, technical matters. His previously unpublished work is an immense treasure trove, and scholars continue to gain new insights into Russell's thought.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Bertrand Russell. 1967–1969, The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, 3 volumes, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n Wallechinsky, David & Irving Wallace. 1975–1981, \"Famous Marriages Bertrand Russell & Alla Pearsall Smith, Part 1\" & \"Part 3\", on \"Alys\" Pearsall Smith, webpage content from The People's Almanac, webpages: Part 1 & Part 3 (accessed 2008-11-08).\n\nFurther reading\nSelected bibliography of Russell's books\nThis is a selected bibliography of Russell's books in English sorted by year of first publication.\n 1896, German Social Democracy, London: Longmans, Green.\n 1897, An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry, Cambridge: At the University Press.\n 1900, A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz, Cambridge: At the University Press.\n 1903, The Principles of Mathematics The Principles of Mathematics, Cambridge: At the University Press.\n 1905 On Denoting, Mind vol. 14, NS, , Basil Blackwell\n 1910, Philosophical Essays, London: Longmans, Green.\n 1910–1913, Principia Mathematica (with Alfred North Whitehead), 3 vols., Cambridge: At the University Press.\n 1912, The Problems of Philosophy, London: Williams and Norgate.\n 1914, Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy, Chicago and London: Open Court Publishing.\n 1916, Principles of Social Reconstruction, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1916, Justice in War-time, Chicago: Open Court.\n 1917, Political Ideals, New York: The Century Co.\n 1918, Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays, London: Longmans, Green.\n 1918, Proposed Roads to Freedom: Socialism, Anarchism, and Syndicalism, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1919, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, London: George Allen & Unwin, ( for Routledge paperback) (Copy at Archive.org).\n 1920, The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism, London: George Allen & Unwin\n 1921, The Analysis of Mind, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1922, The Problem of China, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1923, The Prospects of Industrial Civilization (in collaboration with Dora Russell), London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1923, The ABC of Atoms, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner.\n 1924, Icarus, or the Future of Science, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner.\n 1925, The ABC of Relativity, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner.\n 1925, What I Believe, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner.\n 1926, On Education, Especially in Early Childhood, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1927, The Analysis of Matter, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner.\n 1927, An Outline of Philosophy, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1927, Why I Am Not a Christian, London: Watts.\n 1927, Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell, New York: Modern Library.\n 1928, Sceptical Essays, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1929, Marriage and Morals, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1930, The Conquest of Happiness, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1931, The Scientific Outlook, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1932, Education and the Social Order, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1934, Freedom and Organization, 1814–1914, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1935, In Praise of Idleness, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1935, Religion and Science, London: Thornton Butterworth.\n 1936, Which Way to Peace?, London: Jonathan Cape.\n 1937, The Amberley Papers: The Letters and Diaries of Lord and Lady Amberley (with Patricia Russell), 2 vols., London: Leonard & Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press.\n 1938, Power: A New Social Analysis, London: George Allen & Unwin.\n 1940, An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth, New York: W.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bx-tree",
    "text": "In computer science, the Bx tree is basically a query that is used to update efficient B+ tree-based index structures for moving objects.\n\nIndex structure\nThe base structure of the Bx-tree is a B+ tree in which the internal nodes serve as a directory, each containing a pointer to its right sibling. In the earlier version of the Bx-tree,Christian S. Jensen, Dan Lin, and Beng Chin Ooi. Query and Update Efficient B+tree based Indexing of Moving Objects. In Proceedings of 30th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB), pages 768-779, 2004. the leaf nodes contained the moving-object locations being indexed and corresponding index time. In the optimized version,Dan Lin. Indexing and Querying Moving Objects Databases, PhD thesis, National University of Singapore, 2006. each leaf node entry contains the id, velocity, single-dimensional mapping value and the latest update time of the object. The fanout is increased by not storing the locations of moving objects, as these can be derived from the mapping values.\n\nUtilizing the B+ tree for moving objects\nright|thumb|An example of the Bx-tree with the number of index partitions equal to 2 within one maximum update interval tmu. In this example, there are maximum three partitions existing at the same time. After linearization, object locations inserted at time 0 are indexed in partition 0 with label timestamp 0.5 tmu, object locations updated during time 0 to 0.5 tmu are indexed in partition 1 with label timestamp tmu, and so on (as indicated by arrows). As time elapses, repeatedly the first range expires (shaded area), and a new range is appended (dashed line).|300px\n\nAs for many other moving objects indexes, a two-dimensional moving object is modeled as a linear function as O = ((x, y), (vx, vy), t ), where (x, y) and (vx, vy) are location and velocity of the object at a given time instance t, i.e., the time of last update. The B+ tree is a structure for indexing single-dimensional data. In order to adopt the B+ tree as a moving object index, the Bx-tree uses a linearization technique which helps to integrate objects' location at time t into single dimensional value. Specifically, objects are first partitioned according to their update time. For objects within the same partition, the Bx-tree stores their locations at a given time which are estimated by linear interpolation. By doing so, the Bx-tree keeps a consistent view of all objects within the same partition without storing the update time of an objects.\n\nSecondly, the space is partitioned by a grid and the location of an object is linearized within the partitions according to a space-filling curve, e.g., the Peano or Hilbert curves.\n\nFinally, with the combination of the partition number (time information) and the linear order (location information), an object is indexed in Bx-tree with a one-dimensional index key Bxvalue:\n\nHere index-partition is an index partition determined by the update time and xrep is the space-filling curve value of the object position at the indexed time,  denotes the binary value of x, and “+” means concatenation.\n\nGiven an object O ((7, 2), (-0.1,0.05), 10), tmu = 120, the Bxvalue for O can be computed as follows.\n\n O is indexed in partition 0 as mentioned. Therefore, indexpartition = (00)2.\n O’s position at the label timestamp of partition 0 is (1,5).\n Using Z-curve with order = 3, the Z-value of O, i.e., xrep is (010011)2.\n Concatenating indexpartition and xrep, Bxvalue (00010011)2=19.\n Example O ((0,6), (0.2, -0.3 ),10) and tmu=120 then O's position at the label timestamp of partition: ???\n\nInsertion, update and deletion\nGiven a new object, its index key is computed and then the object is inserted into the Bx-tree as in the B+ tree. An update consists of a deletion followed by an insertion. An auxiliary structure is employed to keep the latest key of each index so that an object can be deleted by searching for the key. The indexing key is computed before affecting the tree. In this way, the Bx-tree directly inherits the good properties of the B+ tree, and achieves efficient update performance.\n\nQueries\n\nRange query\n\nA range query retrieves all objects whose location falls within the rectangular range  at time  not prior to the current time.\n\nThe Bx-tree uses query-window enlargement technique to answer queries. Since the Bx-tree stores an object's location as of sometime after its update time, the enlargement involves two cases: a location must either be brought back to an earlier time or forward to a later time. The main idea is to enlarge the query window so that it encloses all objects whose positions are not within query window at its label timestamp but will enter the query window at the query timestamp.\n\nAfter the enlargement, the partitions of the Bx-tree need to be traversed to find objects falling in the enlarged query window. In each partition, the use of a space-filling curve means that a range query in the native, two-dimensional space becomes a set of range queries in the transformed, one-dimensional space.\n\nTo avoid excessively large query region after expansion in skewed datasets, an optimization of the query algorithm exists,Jensen, C.S., D. Tiesyte, N. Tradisauskas, Robust B+-Tree-Based Indexing of Moving Objects, in Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Mobile Data Management, Nara, Japan, 9 pages, May 9–12, 2006. which improves the query efficiency by avoiding unnecessary query enlargement.\n\nK nearest neighbor query\n\nK nearest neighbor query is computed by iteratively performing range queries with an incrementally enlarged search region until k answers are obtained. Another possibility is to employ similar querying ideas in The iDistance Technique.\n\nOther queries\n\nThe range query and K Nearest Neighbor query algorithms can be easily extended to support interval queries, continuous queries, etc.\n\nAdapting relational database engines to accommodate moving objects\n\nSince the Bx-tree is an index built on top of a B+ tree index, all operations in the Bx-tree, including the insertion, deletion and search, are the same as those in the B+ tree. There is no need to change the implementations of these operations. The only difference is to implement the procedure of deriving the indexing key as a stored procedure in an existing DBMS. Therefore, the Bx-tree can be easily integrated into existing DBMS without touching the kernel.\n\nSpADESpADE : A SPatio-temporal Autonomic Database Engine for location-aware services. is moving object management system built on top of a popular relational database system MySQL, which uses the Bx-tree for indexing the objects. In the implementation, moving object data is transformed and stored directly on MySQL, and queries are transformed into standard SQL statements which are efficiently processed in the relational engine. Most importantly, all these are achieved neatly and independently without infiltrating into the MySQL core.\n\nPerformance tuning\n\nPotential problem with data skew\nThe Bx tree uses a grid for space partitioning while mapping two-dimensional location into one-dimensional key. This may introduce performance degradation to both query and update operations while dealing with skewed data. If grid cell is oversize,  many objects are contained in a cell. Since objects in a cell are indistinguishable to the index, there will be some overflow nodes in the underlying B+ tree. The existing of overflow pages not only destroys the balancing of the tree but also increases the update cost. As for the queries, for the given query region, large cell incurs more false positives and increases the processing time. On the other hand, if the space is partitioned with finer grid, i.e. smaller cells, each cell contains few objects. There is hardly overflow pages so that the update cost is minimized. Fewer false positives are retrieved in a query. However, more cells are needed to be searched. The increase in the number of cells searched also increases the workload of a query.\n\nIndex tuning\nThe ST2B-tree Su Chen, Beng Chin Ooi, Kan-Lee. Tan, and Mario A. Nacismento,  ST2B-tree: A Self-Tunable Spatio-Temporal B+-tree for Moving Objects . In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD), page 29-42, 2008. introduces a self-tuning framework for tuning the performance of the Bx-tree while dealing with data skew in space and data change with time.  In order to deal with data skew in space, the ST2B-tree splits the entire space into regions of different object density using a set of reference points.  Each region uses an individual grid whose cell size is determined by the object density inside of it.\n\nThe Bx-tree have multiple partitions regarding different time intervals. As time elapsed, each partition grows and shrinks alternately. The ST2B-tree utilizes this feature to tune the index online in order to adjust the space partitioning to make itself accommodate to the data changes with time. In particular, as a partition shrinks to empty and starts growing, it chooses a new set of reference points and new grid for each reference point according to the latest data density. The tuning is based on the latest statistics collected during a given period of time, so that the way of space partitioning is supposed to fit the latest data distribution best. By this means, the ST2B-tree is expected to minimize the effect caused by data skew in space and data changes with time.\n\nSee also\n\nB+ tree\nHilbert curve\nZ-order (curve)\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:B-tree"

    "text": "Crispin James Garth Wright (; born 21 December 1942) is a British philosopher, who has written on neo-Fregean (neo-logicist) philosophy of mathematics, Wittgenstein's later philosophy, and on issues related to truth, realism, cognitivism, skepticism, knowledge, and objectivity.  He is Professor of Philosophy at New York University and Professor of Philosophical Research at the University of Stirling, and taught previously at the University of St Andrews, University of Aberdeen, Princeton University and University of Michigan.philosophy.fas.nyu.edu \n\nLife and career\n\nWright was born in Surrey and was educated at Birkenhead School (1950–61) and at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in Moral Sciences in 1964 and taking a PhD in 1968. He took an Oxford BPhil in 1969 and was elected Prize Fellow and then Research Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford, where he worked until 1978. He then moved to the University of St. Andrews, where he was appointed Professor of Logic and Metaphysics and then the first Bishop Wardlaw University Professorship in 1997. As of fall 2008, he is professor at New York University (NYU).  He has also taught at the University of Michigan, Oxford University, Columbia University, and Princeton University. Crispin Wright is founder and director of Arché at the University of St. Andrews, which he left in September 2009 to take up leadership of the new Northern Institute of Philosophy (NIP) at the University of Aberdeen.\n\nPhilosophical work\n\nIn the philosophy of mathematics, he is best known for his book Frege's Conception of Numbers as Objects (1983), where he argues that Frege's logicist project could be revived by removing the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension (sometimes referred to as Basic Law V) from the formal system.  Arithmetic is then derivable in second-order logic from Hume's principle.  He gives informal arguments that (i) Hume's principle plus second-order logic is consistent, and (ii) from it one can produce the Dedekind–Peano axioms.  Both results were proven informally by Gottlob Frege (Frege's Theorem), and would later be more rigorously proven by George Boolos and Richard Heck. Wright is one of the major proponents of neo-logicism, alongside his frequent collaborator Bob Hale. He has also written Wittgenstein and the Foundations of Mathematics (1980).\n\nIn general metaphysics, his most important work is Truth and Objectivity (Harvard University Press, 1992). He argues in this book that there need be no single, discourse-invariant thing in which truth consists, making an analogy with identity. There need only be some principles regarding how the truth predicate can be applied to a sentence, some 'platitudes' about true sentences. Wright also argues that in some contexts, probably including moral contexts, superassertibility will effectively function as a truth predicate. He defines a predicate as superassertible if and only if it is \"assertible\" in some state of information and then remains so no matter how that state of information is enlarged upon or improved. Assertiveness is warrant by whatever standards inform the discourse in question.\n\nMany of his most important papers in philosophy of language, epistemology, philosophical logic, meta-ethics, and the interpretation of Wittgenstein have been collected in two volumes published by Harvard University Press.\n\n Awards \n Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 2012amacad.org\n Leverhulme Trust Personal Research Professor, 1998–2003\n FRSE: Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1996\n FBA: Fellow of the British Academy, 1992britac.ac.uk\n British Academy Research Reader, 1990-2\n Fulbright scholar  at Princeton University, 1985-6\n Prize Fellow, All Souls College, Oxford, 1969–71\n\nBooks\nWittgenstein on the Foundations of Mathematics (Harvard University Press, 1980)\nFrege's Conception of Numbers as Objects (Humanities Press 1983) \nTruth and Objectivity (Harvard University Press, 1992)\nRealism, Meaning, and Truth, 2nd edition (Blackwell 1993)\nThe Reason's Proper Study (co-authored with Bob Hale) (Oxford University Press, 2001)\nRails to Infinity (Harvard University Press, 2001)\nSaving the Differences (Harvard University Press, 2003).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCategory:Fulbright Scholars\nCategory:1942 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:20th-century British philosophers\nCategory:Analytic philosophers\nCategory:British philosophers\nCategory:Philosophers of mathematics\nCategory:Epistemologists\nCategory:21st-century philosophers\nCategory:Fellows of the British Academy\nCategory:Philosophers of language\nCategory:Academics of the University of St Andrews\nCategory:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh\nCategory:People educated at Birkenhead School\nCategory:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nCategory:University of Michigan faculty"

Italy has been the starting point of phenomena of international impact such as the Magna Graecia, the Roman Empire, the Roman Catholic Church, the RomanesqueFirst Romanesque, the Renaissance,  the Baroque, the neo-classicism, the Risorgimento and the European integration. During its history, the nation has given birth to an enormous number of notable people.\n\nBoth the internal and external faces of Western culture were born on the Italian peninsula, whether one looks at the history of the Christian faith, civil institutions (such as the Senate), philosophy, law,Roman law.

Etruscan and Samnite cultures flourished in Italy before the emergence of the Roman Republic, which conquered and incorporated them. Phoenicians and Greeks established settlements in Italy beginning several centuries before the birth of Christ, and the Greek settlements in particular developed into thriving classical civilizations. The Greek ruins in southern Italy are perhaps the most spectacular and best preserved anywhere.\n\nFor more than 2,000 years Italy experienced migrations and invasions and was divided into numerous independent states until 1861 when it became a nation-state.Risorgimento. Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2011. Web. 25 September 2011. Due to this comparatively late unification, and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the Italian peninsula, many traditions and customs that are now recognized as distinctly Italian can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social isolation of these regions, Italy's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe and the world remain immense.\n\nThe famous elements of Italian culture are its art, music, style, and iconic food. Italy was the birthplace of opera,Kimbell, David R. B. Italian Opera. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p. 1. Web. 22 July 2012. and for generations the language of opera was Italian, irrespective of the nationality of the composer.

Before being exported to France, the famous Ballet dance genre also originated in Italy.\n\nThe country boasts several world-famous cities. Rome was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the Pope of the Catholic Church. Florence was the heart of the Renaissance, a period of great achievements in the arts at the end of the Middle Ages.Zirpolo, Lilian H. The A to Z of Renaissance Art.

Italy is home to 54 World Heritage Sites, the largest number of any country in the world.\n\nItaly was the main centre of artistic developments throughout the Renaissance (1300-1600), beginning with the Proto-Renaissance of Giotto and reaching a particular peak in the High Renaissance of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael, whose works inspired the later phase of the Renaissance, known as Mannerism. Italy retained its artistic dominance into the 17th century with the Baroque (1600-1750). Cultural tourism and Neoclassicism (1750-1850) became a major prop to an otherwise faltering economy. Both Baroque and Neoclassicism originated in RomeThe road from Rome to Paris. The birth of a modern Neoclassicism and were the last Italian-born styles that spread to all Western art.\n\nHowever, Italy maintained a presence in the international art scene from the mid-19th century onwards, with cultural movements such as the Macchiaioli, Futurism, Metaphysical, Novecento Italiano, Spatialism, Arte Povera, and Transavantgarde.\n\n Architecture \n\n200px|thumb|left|Florence Cathedral, Arnolfo di Cambio, campanile by Giotto dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi.\nArchitectural ruins from antiquity throughout Italy testify to the greatness of cultures past. The history of architecture in Italy is one that begins with the ancient styles of the Etruscans and Greeks, progressing to classical Roman,Sear, Frank. Roman architecture. Cornell University Press, 1983. p. 10. Web. 23 September 2011. then to the revival of the classical Roman era during the Renaissance and evolving into the Baroque era. During the period of the Italian Renaissance it had been customary for students of architecture to travel to Rome to study the ancient ruins and buildings as an essential part of their education.\nthumb|right| the Arch of Constantine in Rome.\n\nOld St. Peter's Church (begun about A.D. 330) was probably the first significant early Christian basilica, a style of church architecture that came to dominate the early Middle Ages. Old St. Peter's stood on the site of the present St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The first significant buildings in the medieval Romanesque style were churches built in Italy during the 800's. Several outstanding examples of the Byzantine architectural style of the Middle East were also built in Italy. The most famous Byzantine structure is the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice.\n\nThe greatest flowering of Italian architecture took place during the Renaissance. Filippo Brunelleschi made great contributions to architectural design with his dome for the Cathedral of Florence. Leon Battista Alberti was another early Renaissance architect whose theories and designs had an enormous influence on later architects.Davis, John A. \"Italy.\" World Book Advanced. World Book, 2011. Web. 23 September 2011.\n\nPerhaps the greatest achievement of Italian Renaissance architecture was St. Peter's Basilica, originally designed by Donato Bramante in the early 16th century. Andrea Palladio influenced architects throughout western Europe with the villas and palaces he designed in the middle and late 16th century.\n\nThe Baroque period produced several outstanding Italian architects in the 17th century especially known for their churches. The most important architects included Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Francesco Borromini. Numerous modern Italian architects, such as Renzo Piano, are famous worldwide.\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries Italy was affected by the Neoclassical architectural movement. Everything from villas, palaces, gardens, interiors and art began to be based on Roman and Greek themes,Italy Architecture: Neoclassicism, ItalyTravel.com and buildings were also widely themed on the Villa Capra \"La Rotonda\", the masterpiece by Andrea Palladio.\n\nthumb|right|200px|the EUR in Rome is a perfect example of modern Italian architecture\nItalian modern and contemporary architecture refers to architecture in Italy during 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nDuring the Fascist period the so-called \"Novecento movement\" flourished, with figures such as Gio Ponti, Peter Aschieri, Giovanni Muzio. This movement was based on the rediscovery of imperial Rome. Marcello Piacentini, who was responsible for the urban transformations of several cities in Italy, and remembered for the disputed Via della Conciliazione in Rome, devised a form of \"simplified Neoclassicism\".\n\nThe fascist architecture (shown perfectly in the EUR buildings) was followed by the Neoliberty style (seen in earlier works of Vittorio Gregotti) and Brutalist architecture (Torre Velasca in Milan group BBPR, a residential building via Piagentina in Florence, Leonardo Savioli and works by Giancarlo De Carlo).\n\n Fashion and design \n\n220px|thumb|left|A Prada shop in Singapore.\nthumb|Gucci Store on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas\nThe Italian fashion industry is one of the country's most important manufacturing sectors. The majority of the older Italian couturiers are based in Rome. However, Milan is seen as the fashion capital of Italy because many well-known designers are based there and it is the venue for the Italian designer collections.\n\nMany of Italy's top fashion designers have boutiques that can be found around the world. Among the best-known and most exclusive names are Armani, Dolce & Gabbana, Valentino Garavani, Benetton, Fendi, Gucci, Versace, Moschino, and Prada. Accessory and jewelry labels, such as Bulgari and Luxottica are also internationally acclaimed, and Luxottica is the world's largest eyewear company.\n\nCurrently, Milan and Rome, annually compete with other major international centres, such as Paris, New York, London, and Tokyo. Also, the fashion magazine Vogue Italia is considered the most prestigious fashion magazine in the world.\n\nItaly is also prominent in the field of design, notably interior design, architectural design, industrial design, and urban design. The country has produced some well-known furniture designers, such as Gio Ponti and Ettore Sottsass, and Italian phrases such as Bel Disegno and Linea Italiana have entered the vocabulary of furniture design.Miller (2005) p. 486. Web. 26 September 2011. Examples of classic pieces of Italian white goods and pieces of furniture include Zanussi's washing machines and fridges,Insight Guides (2004) p. 220. 26 September 2011. the \"New Tone\" sofas by Atrium, and the post-modern bookcase by Ettore Sottsass, inspired by Bob Dylan's song \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\".\n\nToday, Milan and Turin are the nation's leaders in architectural design and industrial design. The city of Milan hosts the FieraMilano, Europe's biggest design fair. Milan also hosts major design and architecture-related events and venues, such as the Fuori Salone and the Salone del Mobile, and has been home to the designers Bruno Munari, Lucio Fontana, Enrico Castellani, and Piero Manzoni.\n\n Literature \n\n220px|thumb|left|Dante Alighieri, one of the greatest poets of the Middle Ages. His epic poem The Divine Comedy ranks among the finest works of world literature.\nItalian literature began after the founding of Rome in 753 BC. Roman, or Latin literature, was and still is highly influential in the world, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid and Livy. The Romans were also famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama and epigrams. Even though most of these were inspired from the Ancient Greeks, Roman epigrams were usually far more satyrical, sometimes using obscene language to give them an exciting effect. Most of the Roman epigrams were inscriptions or graffiti.\n\nThe basis of the modern Italian Literature in the Italian language, strictly speaking, begins with the early years of the 13th century. Among the influences at work in its formation must first be mentioned the religious revival wrought by St. Francis of Assisi. Therefore, it is considered the first \"Italian voice\" in literature.\n\nAnother Italian voice originated in Sicily. At the court of emperor Frederick II, who ruled the Sicilian kingdom during the first half of the 13th century, lyrics modeled on Provençal forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. The most important of these poets was the notary Giacomo da Lentini, reputed to have invented the sonnet form.\n\nGuido Guinizelli is considered the founder of the Dolce Stil Novo, a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth, pure style, influenced some Florentine poets, especially Guido Cavalcanti and the young Dante Alighieri. Dante's The Divine Comedy is a masterpiece of world literature, helped create the Italian literary language. Furthermore, the poet invented the difficult terza rima for his epic journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise.\n\nThe two great writers of the 14th century, Petrarch and Boccaccio, sought out and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, the Canzoniere. Petrarch's love poetry served as a model for centuries. Equally influential was Boccaccio's Decameron, one of the most popular collections of short stories ever written.\n\n220px|thumb|right|Alessandro Manzoni, one of Italy's greatest 19th-century writers.\n\nItalian Renaissance authors produced a number of important works. Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince is one of the world's most famous essays on political science. Another important work of the period, Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, is perhaps the greatest chivalry poem ever written. Baldassare Castiglione's dialogue The Book of the Courtier describes the ideal of the perfect court gentleman and of spiritual beauty. The lyric poet Torquato Tasso in Jerusalem Delivered wrote a Christian epic, making use of the ottava rima, with attention to the Aristotelian canons of unity.\n\nIn the early 17th century, some literary masterpieces were created, such as Giambattista Marino's long mythological poem, L'Adone. The Baroque period also produced the clear scientific prose of Galileo as well as Tommaso Campanella's The City of the Sun, a description of a perfect society ruled by a philosopher-priest. At the end of the 17th century, the Arcadians began a movement to restore simplicity and classical restraint to poetry, as in Metastasio's heroic melodramas. In the 18th century, playwright Carlo Goldoni replaced Commedia dell'arte with full written plays, many portraying the middle class of his day.\n\nThe Romanticism coincided with some ideas of the Risorgimento, the patriotic movement that brought Italy political unity and freedom from foreign domination. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The time of Italy's rebirth was heralded by the poets Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, and Giacomo Leopardi. The Betrothed by Alessandro Manzoni, the leading Italian Romantic, was the first Italian historical novel to glorify Christian values of justice and Providence. In the late 19th century, a realistic literary movement called Verismo played a major role in Italian literature. Giovanni Verga was the leading author in this movement.\n\nA movement called Futurism influenced Italian literature in the early 20th century. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti wrote The Futurist Manifesto. It called for the use of language and metaphors that glorified the speed, dynamism, and violence of the machine age. Among the Italian literary figures of the early 20th century, Gabriele d'Annunzio, Luigi Pirandello, and Grazia Deledda achieved international renown. Leading writers of the postwar era are Ignazio Silone, Alberto Moravia, Italo Calvino, Umberto Eco, Dario Fo, and the poets Salvatore Quasimodo and Eugenio Montale.\n\n Motion pictures \n\n250px|thumb|left|Federico Fellini, considered one of the most influential and widely revered filmmakers of the 20th century.\nthumb|The Venice Film Festival is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the \"Big Three\" alongside Cannes and Berlin\n\nThe Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Roman Società Italiana Cines, the Ambrosio Film and the Itala Film in Turin. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples.\n\nThe early Italian film industry became internationally known for its historical spectacles. But during the World War I, Italy like other European governments, diverted raw material from their film industries to military needs.\n\nFew major motion pictures were produced during the 1920s and 1930s, but a renaissance of Italian filmmaking developed in the 1940s. At that time, a new generation of directors emerged. They included Vittorio De Sica, Roberto Rossellini, and Luchino Visconti. The impact of the war led several of these directors to make movies that focused on society and its problems. This impulse resulted in the emergence of the first important postwar European film movement, Neorealism. Neorealist directors were concerned primarily with portraying the daily life of ordinary people. They mainly filmed on location rather than on a studio set, and they used mostly nonprofessional actors. These qualities gave Neorealist films a gritty, almost documentary look.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, earthy comedies gained international success, due partly to the popularity of Italian movie stars Gina Lollobrigida, Sophia Loren, and Marcello Mastroianni. In the same years, Sergio Leone helped create a new film genre, ironically nicknamed the \"Spaghetti Western\", because they were made by Italian directors, either in Italy, Spain, or even in the famous Monument Valley Studios in the United States.\n\nAt the same time, a new group of directors won praise. The most significant were Michelangelo Antonioni, Federico Fellini and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Vittorio De Sica, Roberto Rossellini, and Luchino Visconti also continued to film major works. During the late 20th century, the leading Italian directors included Roberto Benigni, Marco Bellocchio, Bernardo Bertolucci, and the brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani.\n\nFumetti\n\nThe official birth of Italian comics (usually called Fumetti in Italian) is 27 December 1908, when the first issue of the Corriere dei Piccoli was published. Attilio Mussino has produced for this weekly a wide range of characters, including a little black child, Bilbolbul, whose almost surrealist adventures took place in a fantastic Africa.\n\nIn 1932 publisher Lotario Vecchi, had already begun publication of Jumbo magazine, using exclusively North American authors. The magazine reached a circulation of 350.000 copies in Italy, sanctioning comics as a mainstream medium with broad appeal. Vecchi moved to Spain three years later, bringing the same title.\n\nIn December 1932, the first Disney comic in Italy, Mickey Mouse, or Topolino in Italian, had been launched by the Florentine publisher Nerbini. The Disney franchise was then taken over by the Mondadori subsidiary, API, in 1935.\n\nIn 1945, Hugo Pratt while attending the Venice Academy of Fine Arts, created, in collaboration with Mario Faustinelli and Alberto Ongaro, Asso di Picche. Their distinctive approach to the art form earned them the name of Venetian school of comics.\n\nIn 1948 Gian Luigi Bonelli initiated a long and successful series of Western strips, starting with the popular Tex Willer. This comic would become the model for a line of publications centered around the popular comic book format that became known as Bonelliano, from the name of the publisher.\n\nSome of the series that followed Tex Willer were Zagor (1961), Mister No (1975), and more recently, Martin Mystère (1982) and Dylan Dog (1986). These comic books presented complete stories in 100+ black-and-white pages in a pocket book format. The subject matter was always adventure, whether western, horror, mystery or science fiction. The Bonelliani are to date the most popular form of comics in the country.\n\nItaly also produces many Disney comics, i.e., stories featuring Disney characters (from Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck universes). After the 1960s, American artists of Disney comics, such as Carl Barks and Floyd Gottfredson did not produce as many stories as in the past. At present American production of new stories has dwindled (Don Rosa publishes in Europe), and this niche has been filled by companies in South America, Denmark and Italy. The Italian 'Scuola disneyana' has produced several innovations: building the Italian standard length for stories (30 pages), reinterpreting famous works of literature in 'Parodie', writing long stories up to 400 pages.\n\nAmong the most important artists and authors are Bonvi, Marco Rota, Romano Scarpa, Giorgio Cavazzano, Giovan Battista Carpi and Guido Martina. The best known Disney character created in Italy is Paperinik (known as Duck Avenger or Phantom Duck to English audiences).\n\n Music \n\nthumb|left|Antonio Vivaldi, in 1723.  His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four Seasons\n\nMusic writing began in Italy. Therefore, Italian words are used to tell us how music is played. Consequently, all countries have adopted technical terms in their Italian form — a demonstration of the crucial role played by Italy, and in particular Florence, in the history of music.\n\nthumb|200px|right|Giuseppe Verdi, one of Italy's greatest opera composers. Portrait by Giovanni Boldini.\nthumb|200px|left|One of the most popular romantic songs of Italy, Santa Lucia.\nFrom folk to classical, music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Having given birth to opera, for example, Italy provides many of the very foundations of the classical music tradition. Some of the instruments that are often associated with classical music, including the piano and violin,Ingles, Tim ; Dilworth, John. Four Centuries of Violin Making: Fine Instruments from the Sotheby's Archive. Cozio Publishing, 2006. p. 11. Web. 21 July 2012. were invented in Italy, and many of the existing classical music forms can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music (such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata).\n\nItalian composers have played a major role in music since the Middle Ages. In the 11th century, Guido of Arezzo, an Italian monk, developed a revolutionary system of notation and method of sight-singing. The Gregorian chant, troubadour song, and the madrigal were forms in early Italian music.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, Giovanni Palestrina composed masterpieces of choral music for use in church services. The first operas were composed in Florence in the 1590s. Opera emerged as an art form during the Baroque period. Claudio Monteverdi was the first great composer of Baroque opera in the early 17th century. Important composers of the late 17th century and early 18th century included Alessandro Scarlatti, his son Domenico, and Antonio Vivaldi. Alessandro became best known for his operas, Domenico for his keyboard compositions, and Vivaldi for his works for violin. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, popular operas were composed by Gioachino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini.\n\nToday, the entire infrastructure that supports music as a profession is extensive in Italy, including conservatories, opera houses, radio and television stations, recording studios, music festivals, and important centers of musicological research. Musical life in Italy remains extremely active, but very Italian-centered and hardly international. Some of the main international Italian pop-singers include 1970s pop-diva Mina, who sold 76 million records worldwide in her lifetime, and singer Laura Pausini, who has sold 45 million albums.

There are other famous venues for opera, including San Carlo in Naples, La Fenice Theatre in Venice, and the Roman arena in Verona. Additionally, there are fifteen publicly owned theaters and numerous privately run ones in Italy. These theaters promote Italian and European plays as well as ballets.Salamone, Frank A. Italy.

The rebirth of science during the Renaissance brought the daring speculations of Leonardo da Vinci (including discoveries in anatomy, meteorology, geology and hydrology) advances in physics and astronomy by Galileo Galilei, and the development of the barometer by Evangelista Torricelli.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Guglielmo Marconi carried out experiments in electricity and developed the wireless, but he was preceded by Count Alessandro Volta, one of the pioneers of electricity, over 100 years earlier. By the end of the Second World War, Enrico Fermi's work in nuclear physics led to the development of both the atomic bomb and peaceful atomic applications.

Some of the world's most elite vehicles were developed in Italy: Lamborghini, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, and Maserati are but a few of the well-known luxury cars that originated in Italy. \nThe country and especially the Italian Institute of Technology have produced some ingenious humanoid robots like iCub.\n\n Sculpture \n\nthumb|left|David, by Michelangelo (Accademia di Belle Arti, Florence, Italy) is a masterpiece of Renaissance and world art.\n\nThe art of sculpture in the Italian peninsula has its roots in ancient times. In the archaic period, when Etruscan cities dominated central Italy and the adjacent sea, Etruscan sculpture flourished. The name of an individual artist, Vulca, who worked at Veii, has been identified. He has left a terracotta Apollo and other figures, and can perhaps claim the distinction of being the most ancient master in the long history of Italian art.\n\nA significant development of this art occurred between the 6th century BC and 5th century AD during the growth of the Roman Empire. The earliest Roman sculpture was influenced by the Etruscans to the north of Rome and by Greek colonists to the south. During the Empire period, the pure realism of the Republican period portrait busts was joined to Greek idealism. The result, evident in Augustus of Primaporta, was often a curious juxtaposition of individualized heads with idealized, anatomically perfect bodies in Classical poses.\n\nthumb|right|Antonio Canova's Venus Victrix.\nDuring the Middle Ages, large sculpture was largely religious. Carolingian artists (named after Charlemagne's family) in northern Italy created sculpture for covers of Bibles, as decoration for parts of church altars, and for crucifixes and giant candlesticks placed on altars.\n\nIn the late 13th century, Nicola Pisano and his son Giovanni began the revolutionary changes that led up to the Renaissance in Italian sculpture, drawing influences from Roman sarcophagi and other remains. Both are noted for their reliefs and ornamentation on pulpits. The Massacre of the Innocents by Giovanni Pisano is an example.\n\nthumb|right|the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\nThe greatest sculptor of the early Renaissance was Donatello.Bergin, Thomas Goddard ; Speake, Jennifer. Encyclopedia of The Renaissance and the Reformation. Infobase Publishing, 2004. pp. 144-145. Web. 10 November 2012. In 1430, he had produced a bronze statue of David, which reestablished the classical idea of beauty in the naked human body. Conceived fully in the round and independent of any architectural surroundings, it was the first major work of Renaissance sculpture. Among the other brilliant sculptors of the 15th century were Jacopo della Quercia, Michelozzo, Bernardo and Antonio Rossellino, Giambologna  and Agostino di Duccio.\n\nMichelangelo's great brooding sculptures, such as the figures of Night and Day in the Medici Chapel in Florence, dominated High Renaissance Italian sculpture. His David, is perhaps, the most famous sculpture in the world.Ciuccetti, Laura. Michelangelo: David. Giunti Editore, 1998. p. 24. Web. 16 November 2012. It differs from previous representations of the subject in that David is depicted before his battle with Goliath and not after the giant's defeat. Instead of being shown victorious over a foe much larger than he, David looks tense and ready for combat.\n\nGian Lorenzo Bernini was the most important sculptor of the Baroque period.Duiker, William J. ; Spielvogel, Jackson J. World History. Cengage Learning, 2008. pp. 450-451. Web. 10 November 2012. He combined emotional and sensual freedom with theatrical presentation and an almost photographic naturalism. Bernini's saints and other figures seem to sit, stand, and move as living people — and the viewer becomes part of the scene. This involvement of the spectator is a basic characteristic of Baroque sculpture. One of his most famous works is Ecstasy of Saint Teresa.\n\nThe Neoclassical movement arose in the late 18th century. The members of this very international school restored what they regarded as classical principles of art. They were direct imitators of ancient Greek sculptors, and emphasized classical drapery and the nude. The leading Neoclassical artist in Italy, was Antonio Canova, who like many other foreign neoclassical sculptors including Bertel Thorvaldsen was based in Rome. His ability to carve pure white Italian marble has seldom been equaled. Most of his statues are in European collections, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City owns important works, including Perseus and Cupid and Psyche.\n\nIn the 20th century, many Italians played leading roles in the development of modern art. Futurist sculptors tried to show how space, movement, and time affected form. These artists portrayed objects in motion, rather than their appearance at any particular moment. An example is Umberto Boccioni's Unique Forms of Continuity in Space.\n\n Theatre \n\nthumb|left|220px|Commedia dell'arte troupe Gelosi in a late 16th-century Flemish painting.\n\nItalian theatre can be traced back into the Roman which was heavily influenced by the Greek tradition, and, as with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists tended to adapt and translate from the Greek. For example, Seneca's Phaedra was based on that of Euripides, and many of the comedies of Plautus were direct translations of works by Menander.\n\nOpposition from the early church was one of the reasons for the decline of the Roman theater that began in the 4th century AD. Early Christians saw a connection between theatre and pagan religions, and the church fathers argued that the evil characters portrayed onstage taught immorality. For this reason, large theatrical performances disappeared after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.\n\nIronically, the earliest recorded drama in all parts of Western Europe was the Liturgical drama of the Church. In fact, during the medieval period, the Church began to act out particular Bible passages. These dramatizations grew into staged Christmas and Easter stories. Regions in France, Germany, and England showed the most activity of Liturgical drama. The Catholic Church thus made a more concerted effort to utilize drama and theatre in the propagation of the gospel.\n\nDuring the 16th century and on into the 18th century Commedia dell'arte was a form of improvisational theatre, although it is still performed today. Travelling teams of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of juggling, acrobatics, and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called canovaccio.\n\nItalian theatre has been active in producing outstanding contemporary European work and in staging important revivals, although no native playwright has produced works that can rival those of Luigi Pirandello from the early 20th century. In the late 20th century Dario Fo received international acclaim for his highly improvisational style.\n\n Visual art \n\nthumb|right|upright=1.75|The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci, possibly one of the most famous and iconic examples of Italian art\n\nThe history and development of art in Western culture is grounded in hundreds of years of Italian history. In Ancient Rome, Italy was the centre for art and architecture. There were many Italian artists during the Gothic and Medieval periods, and the arts flourished during the Italian Renaissance. Later styles in Italy included Mannerism, Baroque, and Macchiaioli. Futurism developed in Italy in the 20th century. Florence, Venice and Rome, in particular, are brimming with art treasures in museums, churches, and public buildings.\n\nthumb|left|250px|The Creation of Adam is one of the scenes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican, painted by Michelangelo sometime between 1508 and 1512.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance produced many of the greatest painters in art history. They were all influenced by the work of Giotto di Bondone in the late 13th century. One of the most influential artists who ever lived,North Carolina Museum of Art. Nagy, Rebecca Martin ; Spence, June ; Burden, Virginia. North Carolina Museum of Art: handbook of the collections. The Museum, 1998. p. 120. 24 September 2011. Giotto changed the course of Western art by painting in a new realistic style.\n\nFlorence became the center of early Renaissance art. The great Florentine masters of painting included Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Andrea Mantegna, Sandro Botticelli, and Paolo Uccello. The greatest artist of the 15th century was probably Leonardo da Vinci.Jacobsen, Aaron H. Leonardo da Vinci. Scholastic.com. Web. 21 July 2012. His portrait Mona Lisa and his religious scene The Last Supper are among the most famous paintings in history.\n\nThe later Renaissance was dominated by Raphael and Michelangelo. Raphael painted balanced, harmonious pictures that expressed a calm, noble way of life. Michelangelo achieved greatness both as a painter and sculptor. In Venice, a number of artists were painting richly colored works during the 16th century. The most famous Venetian masters included Giorgione, Titian, and Tintoretto.\n\nItalian painters dominated the Baroque period. Annibale Caracci and Caravaggio were the most important early Baroque painters. Caracci is also credited with the invention of caricature, a visual version of parody.Bloom, Jonathan M. ; Blair, Sheila. The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture (Volume 3). Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 356. Web. 11 December 2013.Patrick, James. Renaissance and Reformation (Volume 1). Marshall Cavendish, 2007. p. 195. Web. 11 December 2013.\n\nIn the 20th century, many Italians played leading roles in the development of modern art. Giorgio de Chirico gained fame for his haunting paintings of empty city squares. Amedeo Modigliani won renown with a series of portraits.\n\n Cuisine \n\nthumb|left|250px|Pasta with pesto sauce.\nthumb|right|180px|Brunello di Montalcino is one of Italy's finest red wines, made around the town of Montalcino from a Sangiovese variant known locally as Brunello.\n\nItalian cuisine has developed through centuries of social and political changes, it has its roots in ancient Rome.Creasy, Rosalind. The edible Italian garden. Periplus, 1999. p. 57. Web. 27 November 2013. Artichokes, peas, lettuce, parsley, melons, and apples, as well as wine and cheese, many kinds of meat, and grains were all enjoyed by ancient Romans. For feasts Roman cooks used many spices, developed recipes for cheesecake and omelets, and roasted all types of meat. From this noble beginning a sophisticated and flavorful cuisine has emerged. Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.Del Conte, 11-21.\n\nItalian cuisine, like other facets of the culture, speaks with highly inflected regional accents. There are certain self-consciously national constants: you can find spaghetti with tomato sauce and pizza pretty much everywhere, but this nationalisation of culinary identity didn't really take hold until after the Second World War, when southern immigrants flooded to the north in search of work, and even those classics vary from place to place; small enclaves still hold fast to their unique local forms of pasta and particular preparations. Classics such as Pasta e fagioli, while found everywhere, are prepared differently according to local traditions. Gastronomic explorations of Italy are best undertaken by knowing the local traditions and savouring the local foods on the spot.\n\nthumb|left|180px|A chocolate gelato ice cream dessert.\nthumb|right|240px|Neapolitan pizza Margherita.\n\nNorthern Italy, mountainous in many parts, is notable for the alpine cheeses of the Valle d'Aosta, the pesto of Liguria, and, in Piedmonte, the Alba truffle. In the Alto Adige, the influence of neighboring Austria may be found in a regional repertoire that includes speck and dumplings. In the north, risotto and polenta have tended to serve the staple function taken by pasta across the rest of the country. Italy's center includes the celebrated culinary regions of Tuscany — famous for its olive oil and bean dishes — and Emilia-Romagna — home of prosciutto di Parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and ragù — the latter now produced (and traduced) worldwide as spaghetti alla bolognese. Southern Italy includes the hearty food of Lazio in which meat and offal frequently figure, but also the vegetable-focused fare of Basilicata, historically one of Italy's poorest regions. The islands of Sicily and Sardinia have distinctively different foodways. The former is notable for its many sweet dishes, seafood, and citrus fruit, while Sardinian cuisine has traditionally looked to its hilly interior with a cuisine centered on lamb, sucking pig, breads, and pecorino sardo. It is in the food of Naples and Campania, however, that many visitors would recognize the foods that have come to be regarded as quintessentially Italian: pizza, spaghetti with tomato sauce, aubergine parmigiana (but the origins of the two last dishes are claimed by Sicily).\n\nAlso, Italy exports and produces the highest level of wine, exporting over 2.38 million tonnes in 2011. , Italy was responsible for producing approximately one-fifth of the world's wine.Mulligan, Mary Ewing ; McCarthy, Ed. Italy: A passion for wine. 2006, 62(7), 21-27. Web. 27 September 2011. Some Italian regions are home to some of the oldest wine-producing traditions in the world. Etruscans and Greek settlers produced wine in the country long before the Romans started developing their own vineyards in the 2nd century BC. Roman grape-growing and winemaking was prolific and well-organized, pioneering large-scale production and storage techniques like barrel-making and bottling. Famous and traditional Italian wines include Barbaresco, Barbera, Barolo, Brunello di Montalcino, Chianti, Corvina, Dolcetto and Nero d'Avola, to name a few.\n\nthumb|right|200px|The espresso comes from the Italian esprimere, which means \"to express,\" and refers to the process by which hot water is forced under pressure through ground coffee.Santos, Roseane M. ; Lima, Darcy R. An Unashamed Defense of Coffee. Xlibris Corporation, 2009. p. 140. Web. 28 November 2013.\nthumb|190px|left|Venetian dessert tiramisù.\n\nThe country is also famous for its gelato, or traditional ice-cream often known as Italian ice cream abroad. There are gelaterias or ice-cream vendors and shops all around Italian cities, and it is a very popular dessert or snack, especially during the summer. Sicilian granitas, or a frozen dessert of flavored crushed ice, more or less similar to a sorbet or a snow cone, are popular desserts not only in Sicily or their native towns of Messina and Catania, but all over Italy (even though the Northern and Central Italian equivalent, the gratta checca, commonly found in Rome or Milan is slightly different from the traditional granita siciliana). Italy also boasts an assortment of desserts. The Christmas cakes pandoro and panettone are popular in the North (pandoro is from Verona, whilst panettone is milanese), however, they have also become popular desserts in other parts of Italy and abroad. The Colomba Pasquale is eaten all over the country on Easter day, and is a more traditional alternative to chocolate easter eggs. Tiramisu is a very popular and iconic Italian dessert from Veneto which has become famous worldwide. Other Italian cakes and sweets include cannoli, the cassata siciliana, fruit-shaped marzipans and panna cotta.\n\nCoffee, and more specifically espresso, has become highly important to the cuisine of Italy. Cappuccino is also a famous Italian coffee drink, which is usually sweeter and less dark than espresso, and can be served with foam or cream on top, on which chocolate powder and sugar is usually sprinkled. Caffelatte is a mixture of coffee and milk, and is usually drunk at breakfast time (unlike most other Italian coffee-types, children and adults drink it alike, since it is lighter and more milky than normal coffee). The Bicerin is Turin's own coffee. It is a mix between cappuccino and normal hot chocolate, and is made with equal amounts of drinking chocolate, coffee and a slight addition of milk and creamy foam.\n\n Education \n\nthumb|right|240px|Chiostro of the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore.\n\nItaly's public education is free and compulsory from 6–16 years of age. Italy. Education and Study in Italy. Spain Exchange. Web. 12 July 2010. It has a five-year primary stage and an eight-year secondary stage, divided into first-grade secondary school (middle school) and second-grade secondary school (or high school). Italy has both public and private education systems.\n\nPrimary school lasts five years. Until middle school, the normal educational curriculum is uniform for all: although one can attend a private or state-funded school, the subjects studied are the same, except in special schools for pupils with different care requirements.\n\nSecondary education (Scuole medie) is further divided in two stages: Medie Inferiori, which correspond to the Middle School grades, and Medie Superiori, which correspond to the High School level. The lower tier of Scuole Medie corresponds to Middle School, lasts three years, and involves an exam at the end of the third year; Scuole Superiori usually last five years (even though Istituti Professionali might offer a diploma after only three years). Every tier involves an exam at the end of the final year required to access the following tier.\n\nThe secondary school situation varies, since there are several types of schools differentiated by subjects and activities. The main types are the Liceo, the Istituto Tecnico and the Istituto Professionale. Any kind of secondary school that lasts 5 years grants access to the final exam, called Esame di Stato conclusivo del corso di studio di Istruzione Secondaria Superiore or Esame di Maturità. This exam takes place every year in June and July and grants access to any faculty at any University.\n\nthumb|left|240px|Palazzo della Carovana, the current seat of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa.\n\nItaly hosts a broad variety of universities, colleges and academies. \nThe Sapienza University of Rome, founded with the Papal bull In supremae praeminentia dignitatis issued on 20 April 1303 by Pope Boniface VIII, is the largest EU university by enrollments and at the same time it is present in all major international university rankings.\n\nMilan's Bocconi University, has been ranked among the top 20 best business schools in the world by The Wall Street Journal international rankings, especially thanks to its Master of Business Administration program, which in 2007 placed it no. 17 in the world in terms of graduate recruitment preference by major multinational companies.

Machiavelli's Children. Cornell University Press, 2005. p. 33. Web. 23 October 2012. \"The literati taught that Italy had moral and intellectual primacy because it was the cradle of European civilization — of Roman law, of Christian thought, of the Renaissance. \"Primacy\" was Italy's great founding myth — the idea capable of animating and agitating, mobilizing, directing popular conscience, and sustaining action. Italy could be the spiritual empire that transforms and unites Western civilization.\"Fisher, Ian. Italy (Background). The New York Times. Web. 1 December 2013. \"Encyclopædia Britannica describes Italy as \"less a single nation than a collection of culturally related points in an uncommonly pleasing setting.\" However concise, this description provides a good starting point for the difficult job of defining Italy, a complex nation wrapped in as much myth and romance as its own long-documented history. The uncommonly pleasant setting is clear: the territory on a boot-shaped peninsula in the Mediterranean, both mountainous and blessed with  of coast. The culturally related points include many of the fountains of Western culture: the Roman Empire, the Catholic church, the Renaissance (not to mention pasta and pizza).\" \"It has been central to the formation of the European Union, and after the destruction of World War II, built itself with uncommon energy to regain a place in the global economy.\"De Grummond, Nancy Thomson. \"Rediscovery,\" in Larissa Bonfante, ed., Etruscan Life and Afterlife: A Handbook of Etruscan Studies. Wayne State University Press, 1986. pp. 18-46. Web. 18 November 2013. Owing to Italy's unique geographical location and configuration, excellent climate and numerous cultural and artistic expressions, the country has enjoyed a very privileged cultural position in Europe and the world. As the direct descendant of the Roman Empire, the Italian nation has achieved and enjoyed a unique status of political power. The Roman Empire and cultural domination of the Italian Renaissance, which were influenced by Etruscan historical tradition, still represents a model of cultural expression for other nations.Hanlon, Gregory. \"Italy.\" Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World, 2004. Web. 6 November 2012. \"Italy's cultural inventions provided the standards to which Europeans complied in literature, architecture, art, and music until the end of the 19th century, although the country lost some of its pilot role by 1650. The era is synonymous with the baroque aesthetic, fashioned in Rome in the late 16th century, and often closely associated with the Catholic Church.\" Continuous learning, creativity, and technological advancement on the Italian peninsula have shaped virtually every aspect of Western culture.\n\nThough its archaeological record stretches back tens of thousands of years, Italian history begins with the Etruscans, an ancient civilization that rose between the Arno and Tiber rivers. At that time, Italy was a hodgepodge of peoples and languages. They included the Celts in the north, Greek colonists in southern Italy, and such mountain peoples as the Sabines and the Samnites. In addition, the Phoenicians, who were great sea traders, established colonies throughout the Mediterranean region, including settlements on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia.\n\nthumb|left|250px|Sandro Botticelli, The Birth of Venus (c. 1486). Tempera on canvas. 172.5 cm × 278.9 cm (67.9 in × 109.6 in). Uffizi, Florence\n\nThe Etruscans and the other inhabitants of the peninsula were supplanted in the 3rd century BC by the Romans, who soon became the chief power in the Mediterranean world and whose empire stretched from Iraq to Scotland by the 2nd century AD.Italy. Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2012. Web. 25 October 2012. The empire influenced the government, the arts, and the architecture of many later groups of people.\n\nWith Emperor Constantine's conversion to Christianity in 312, Rome became the open and official seat of the Catholic Church, and Italy has had a profound effect on the development of Christianity and of Western concepts of faith and morality ever since.Woodhead, Linda. An introduction to Christianity. Cambridge University Press, 2004. pp. 43-44. Web. 22 September 2011. Like the other works of Christian charity, the care of the sick was from the beginning a sacred duty for each of the faithful, but it devolved in a special way upon the bishops, presbyters, and deacons. According to historian William Lecky, the hospitals were unknown before Christianity.Lecky, William Edward Hartpole. History of European morals from Augustus to Charlemagne (Volume 2). D. Appleton and Co., 1870. p. 84. Web. 22 October 2012. \"Christianity for the first time made charity a rudimentary virtue, giving it a leading place in the moral type and in the exhortations of its teachers. Besides its general influence in stimulating the affections, it effected a complete revolution in this sphere, by representing the poor as the special representatives of the Christian founder, and thus making the love of Christ rather than the love of man the principle of charity.\" After the fall of Rome in the 5th century, the Italian peninsula was divided among many different rulers.\n\nthumb|right|240px|St. Peter's Basilica is the world's largest Christian church. It is the second church to stand above the crypt (tomb) believed to hold the body of Saint Peter, the first pope.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, which lasted from about the 5th century through the 15th century, the Roman Catholic Church replaced the Roman Empire as the unifying force in Europe.Nice, Alex T. \"Rome, Ancient.\" World Book Advanced. World Book, 2012. Web. 15 July 2012. It used the Latin language and preserved the classics of Latin literature. In addition, the influence of the Church on the spread of literacy, has had a significant impact on European society. Günther S. Wegener has carefully documented the correlation between Bible translation and the spread of literacy in European languages. Wegener, Günther S. La Bible et nous. Flammarion, 1958. Web. 14 June 2012. In fact, during the Middle Ages, the most important branch of learning was theology (the study of God). This new intellectual approach has been called Scholasticism. Italy, in virtue of this, became a seat of great formal learning in 1088 with the establishment of the University of Bologna, the first university in Europe. Other Italian universities soon followed.\n\nAmong the eminent personalities of the Christian world during the Middle Ages, perhaps the most important was that of Benedict of Nursia. His formula ora et labora, influenced the idea of work in Western monasticism and indirectly prepared the way for our modern high esteem of labor. For the development of their ideas about purgatory western theologians relied heavily on the authority of Pope Gregory I.Reyes, E. Christopher. In His Name. AuthorHouse, 2010. p. 457.

In a society — like that of medieval Europe — deeply found on religion, change the geography of the other world means to operate on a real mind revolution, it means to change life itself.\n\nIn Italy medieval communes were sworn associations of townsmen that arose during the 11th century to overthrow the rule of the local bishop or feudal magnates. The communal experience of medieval Italy was somehow salient for the origins of modern democracy.Putnam, Robert D. ; Leonardi, Robert ; Nannetti, Raffaella. Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Princenton, 1993. Web. 6 November 2011. Many cities — especially Florence, Genoa, Pisa, Milan, and Venice — became powerful and independent city-states. An intellectual revival, stimulated in part by the freer atmosphere of the cities and in part by the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Latin writings, gave rise to the humanist attitudes and ideas that formed the basis of the Renaissance.\n\nthumb|left|the Leaning Tower of Pisa\n\nRenaissance period saw a rebirth of many interests, particularly in the arts.Landau, Sarah Bradford. Renaissance (14th-17th century). Scholastic.com. Web. 25 September 2011.Italy: Birthplace of the Renaissance.  Immaculateheartacademy.org. Web. 18 July 2012. By the early 15th century, in Florence, a circle of architects, painters, and sculptors have sought to revive classical art. The leader of this group was an architect, Filippo Brunelleschi. He designed churches reflecting classical models. To him we also owe a scientific discovery of the first importance in the history of art: the rules of perspective. In painting, Leonardo da Vinci and other Italian painters used a technique called sfumato that created softness in their portraits. At the same time, Italy witnessed the revival of the fresco. In music, both the small-scale madrigal and the large-scale opera were inventions of the period with a long future. Italian cities invented the modern conservatory to train professional musicians, as they invented the art academy as a place to master the techniques and the theory of painting, sculpture, and architecture. Rome and Venice witnessed the emergence of the first art \"market\" where buyers and sellers exchanged artworks as commodities.\n\nthumb|left|240px|The discovery of the New World by Christoper Columbus.\n\nIt was no accident that the origin of the European system of banks was born in Renaissance Italy. By the 1430s, the Medici family dominated the ruling class of Florence. The family controlled the largest bank in Europe and was headed by a series of talented and ambitious men. Under Medici domination, the Florentine republic in some ways resembled a signorial government.\n\nSome of the greatest explorers of the late 15th century and early 16th century were Italians exposed to the traditions of the Renaissance. Christopher Columbus — like such other Italian explorers as John Cabot, Giovanni da Verrazzano, and Amerigo Vespucci — was willing to take enormous risks to achieve results that people had never dreamed of. In a sense, Columbus's arrival in America in 1492 was one of the greatest achievements of the Renaissance.\n\nIn general terms, the Baroque era is sometimes called the era of genius, since it was at this time in history that the scientific revolution that established the foundations of modern science was launched. In the pantheon of the scientific revolution, Galileo Galilei takes a high position because of his pioneering use of quantitative experiments with results analyzed mathematically.\n\nthumb|right|200px|Italy has been a home for innovation in science in the centuries since Galileo formulated his theories of planetary movement.\n\nThe intellectual dynamism in 18th century Italy was considerable, across the gamut of genres. Italian elites became conversant with French Enlightenment principles and with English ideas, too, spread by young aristocrats on the grand tour. By the 1760s and 1770s, the Italian authors who were members of academies and contributors to philosophical and literary journals began to disseminate their ideas close to the realm of power in Milan and Turin, Parma and Modena, Florence and Naples. Important representatives of the Italian Enlightenment were Pietro Verri, Pietro Giannone, and Philip Mazzei, a close friend of Thomas Jefferson, who spent many years in America and had an indirect influence on the drafting of the Declaration of Independence. Inspired by Cesare Beccaria's theses — on liberal ideas and humanitarian sentiments — the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was the first state in the world to abolish the death penalty in 1786.Bruni, Luigino ; Zamagni, Stefano. Civil Economy: Efficiency, Equity, Public Happiness. Peter Lang, 2007. p. 97. Web. 22 August 2012.\n\nItaly continued its leading cultural role through the Romantic period, when its dominance in painting and sculpture diminished and it reestablished a strong presence in music. For example, the great vocal tradition of 19th-century European opera was bel canto, which simply means \"beautiful singing.\" At the same time Italy was forming itself into one nation, the period called the Risorgimento.\n\nItalian artists have been quite influential in the 20th century, and some of the Italian exponents of Modernism in the 1920s and 1930s continue to have a strong presence in the international contemporary art market. A new movement called Fascism, led by Benito Mussolini, a former Socialist, grew increasingly popular. Italian Fascism became a model for similar movements in Europe and Latin America. The nationalism of Italian Fascism was culturally based.Macdonald, Hamish. Mussolini and Italian Fascism. Nelson Thornes, 1999. p. 48. Web. 16 November 2013. \"It was rooted in the glorious past of the Roman Empire — a vision referred to, and embellished, as Romanità.\" The parties and organizations associated with these leaders also adopted the Roman salute.\n\nKnown in many circles as the father of the Atomic Age, Enrico Fermi was an Italian who bore witness to the discovery, control, and use of atomic power. Following World War II, Italian neorealism became an important force in motion pictures, and by the 1960s, Italy had established itself as one of a handful of great European film cultures. In the same years, the country has also been central to the formation of the European Union. Today Italy is one of the international leaders in fashion and design.\n\n Italophilia \n\nthumb|left|220px|The Roman Empire provided an inspiration for the medieval European. Although the Holy Roman Empire rarely acquired a serious geopolitical reality, it possessed great symbolic significance.\n\nIf the origins of the western intellectual heritage go back to the Greeks and, less directly, to the peoples of Egypt and the Near East, the contribution of Rome to the wider spreading of Western Civilization was tremendous. In fields such as language, law, politics, religion, and art Roman culture continues to affect our lives.Chase, Myrna ; Jacob, Margaret ; Jacob, James ; Von Laue, Theodore. Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society (Volume 1). Cengage Learning. pp. 154-160. Web. 23 November 2013. Rome was the center of an empire that stretched across a large segment of the then-known world, and later became the center of the Christian faith. Ancient Italy is identified with Rome and the so-called Romanophilia.\n\nDespite the fall of the Roman Empire, its legacy continued to have a significant impact on the cultural and political life in Europe. For the medieval mind, Rome came to constitute a central dimension of the European traditionalist sensibility. The idealisation of this Empire as the symbol of universal order led to the construction of the Holy Roman Empire. Writing before the outbreak of the First World War, the historian Alexander Carlyle noted that \"we can without difficulty recognize\" not only \"the survival of the tradition of the ancient empire\" but also a \"form of the perpetual aspiration to make real the dream of the universal commonwealth of humanity.\"Jameson, John Franklin ; Bourne, Henry Eldridge ; Schuyler, Robert Livingston. The American Historical Review. (Full text) American Historical Association, 1914. Web. 09. Dec. 2013.\n\nthumb|right|200px|William Shakespeare is an example of an Italophile of the 16th century.\n\nDuring much of the Middle Ages (about the 5th century through the 15th century), the Roman Catholic Church had great political power in Western Europe. Throughout its history, the Catholic faith has inspired many great works of architecture, art, literature, and music. These works include French medieval Gothic cathedrals, the Italian artist Michelangelo's frescoes in the Vatican, the Italian writer Dante's epic poem The Divine Comedy, and the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Requiem.\n\nFascination about anything Italian during the Renaissance period culminated in the international movement of Italophilia.\n\nAs for Italian artists they were in demand almost all over Europe. Torrigiano and Zuccari worked in England, Masolino in Hungary, Luca Cambiasi and Pellegrino Tibaldi in Spain, Jacopo Sansovino in Portugal, Morando and others in Poland. The demand seems to have been greatest in France, more especially at the French court, which employed (among others) Leonardo da Vinci, Rosso, Primaticcio, Niccolò dell'Abbate and Sebastiano Serlio. Italian craftsmen were engaged to work on building sites from Munich to Zamość. Italian actors performed at the courts of France, Spain, Poland and elsewhere.\n\nthumb|left|220px|The Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., reflects the president's admiration for classical Roman aesthetics.\n\nThe Italian language was fashionable, at court for example, as well as Italian literature and art. The same William Shakespeare is said to show some Italophilia in his many works related to Italy, like Romeo and Juliet and The Merchant of Venice. According to Robin Kirkpatrick, Professor of Italian and English Literatures at Cambridge University, Shakespeare shared \"with his contemporaries and immediate forebears a fascination with Italy.\"Kirkpatrick, Robin. English and Italian literature from Dante to Shakespeare: a study of sources, analogue and divergence. Longman, 1995. p. 278. Web. 22 November 2013. In 16th century Spain, cultural italophilia was also widespread (while the Spanish influence in Italy was also great) and the king Philip IV himself considered Italian as his favorite foreign language.\n\nThe movement of \"international Italophilia\" around 1600 certainly held the German territories in its sway, with one statistic suggesting that up to a third of all books available in Germany in the early 17th century were in Italian.Burke, Peter. \"The Uses of Italy,\" in Roy Porter and Mikulás̆ Teich, ed., The Renaissance in National Context. Cambridge University Press, 1992. p. 13. Web. 21 November 2013. Themes and styles from il pastor fido were adapted endlessly by German artists, including Opitz, who wrote several poems based on Guarini's text, and Schütz himself, whose settings of a handful of passages appeared in his 1611 book of Italian madrigals. Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold I were great admirers of Italian culture and made Italian (which they themselves spoke perfectly) a prestigious language at their court. German baroque composers or architects were also very much influenced by their Italian counterparts.\n\nDuring the 18th century, Italy was in the spotlight of the European grand tour, a period in which learned and wealthy foreign, usually British or German, aristocrats visited the country due to its artistic, cultural and archaeological richness. Since then, throughout the centuries, many writers and poets have sung of Italy's beauty; from Goethe to Stendhal to Byron, Italy's natural beauty and her people's creativity inspired their works. Percy Bysshe Shelley famously said that Italy is \"the paradise of exiles.\"Shelley, Percy Bysshe. The Narrative Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley (Volume 1). Wildside Press LLC, 2008. p. 27. Web. 21 November 2013.\n\nItaliophilia was not uncommon in the United States. Thomas Jefferson was a great admirer of Italy and ancient Rome. Jefferson is largely responsible for the neo-classical buildings in Washington, D.C. that echo Roman and Italian architectural styles.\n\nSpain provided an equally telling example of Italian cultural admiration in the 18th century. The installation of a team of Italian architects and artists, headed by Filippo Juvarra, has been interpreted as part of Queen Elisabeth Farnese's conscious policy to mould the visual culture of the Spanish court along Italian lines. The engagement of Corrado Giaquinto from Molfetta and eventually the Venetian Jacopo Amigoni as the creators of the painted decorative space for the new seat of the Spanish court was a clear indication of this aesthetic orientation, while the later employment of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and his son Giovanni Domenico confirmed the Italophile tendency.\n\nThe Victorian era in Great Britain saw Italophilic tendencies. Britain supported its own version of the imperial Pax Romana, called Pax Britannica. John Ruskin was a Victorian Italophile who respected the concepts of morality held in Italy.Wilson, A.N. The Victorians. Random House, 2011. p. 86. Web. 23 November 2013. Also the great writer Henry James has exhibited Italophilia in several of his novels. However, Ellen Moers writes that \"In the history of Victorian Italophilia no name is more prominent than that of Elizabeth Barrett Browning....[She places] Italy as the place for the woman of genius ...\"Mahkovec, Linda. Voicing Female Ambition and Purpose: The Role of the Artist Figure in the Works of George Eliot. ProQuest, 2008. p. 33. Web. 23 November 2013.\n\nItalian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi, along with Giuseppe Mazzini and Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, led the struggle for Italian unification in the 19th century. For his battles on behalf of freedom in Europe and Latin America, Garibaldi has been dubbed the \"Hero of Two Worlds.\" Many of the greatest intellectuals of his time, such as Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and George Sand showered him with admiration. He was so appreciated in the United States that Abraham Lincoln offered him a command during the Civil War, (Garibaldi turned it down).Appy, Christian G. Cold War Constructions: The Political Culture of United States Imperialism, 1945-1966. University of Massachusetts Press, 2000. p. 108. Web. 24 November 2013. \n\nthumb|left|Pinocchio Disney film is based on The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi.\n\nDuring the Fascist era, several leaders in Europe and Latin America modeled their government and economic system on Italian Fascism. Adolf Hitler was an avid admirer of Benito Mussolini.Keegan, John. The Mask Of Command: A Study of Generalship. Random House, 2011. p. 281. Web. 2 December 2013. \"[A]s I walked with [the Duce] in the gardens of the Villa Borghese, I could easily compare his profile with that of the Roman busts, and I realised he was one of the Caesars.\" To justify his Italophilia, Hitler had to convince himself that northern Italians were somehow racially Aryan — \"from the cultural point of view,\" he once remarked, \"we are more closely linked with the Italians than with any other people\"Trevor-Roper, Hugh. Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944: Secret Conversations. Enigma Books, 2013. p. 203. Web. 23 November 2013. — and that the veins of Mussolini, Dante and other heroes pulsed with no contaminating blood from the inferior \"Mediterranean race.\"\n\nIn 1940 Walt Disney Productions produced Pinocchio based on the Italian children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi, the most translated non-religious book in the world and one of the best-selling books ever published, as well as a canonical piece of children's literature. The film was the second animated feature film produced by Disney.\n\nAfter World War II, such brands as Ferrari and Alfa Romeo became well known for racing and sports cars. Since then Italy has experienced a strong economic growth, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, which lifted the country to the position of being one of the most industrialized nations in the world. Italian product design, fashion, film, and cuisine and the notion of Italy as the embodiment of la dolce vita for German tourism — all left an imprint on contemporary Italophilia.\n\n Italian people \n\nthumb|200px|left|Leonardo da Vinci is one of the greatest painters and most versatile geniuses in history.\n\nThe Italian peninsula has been at the heart of Western cultural development at least since Roman times.Worldmark encyclopedia of the nations. Gale Research, 1995. p. 241. Web. 17 July 2012. Important poets of the Roman republic and empire were Lucretius, Catullus, Virgil, Horace, and Ovid. Also prominent in Latin literature were the orator-rhetorician Cicero; the satirist Juvenal; the prose writers Pliny the Elder, his nephew Pliny the Younger; and the historians Sallust, Livy, and Suetonius. Julius Caesar, renowned as a historian and prose stylist, is even more famous as a military and political leader. The first of the Roman emperors was Octavian, better known by the honorific Augustus. Noteworthy among later emperors are the tyrants Caligula and Nero, the philosopher-statesman Marcus Aurelius, and Constantine I, who was the first to accept Christianity. No history of the Christian Church during the medieval period would be complete without mention of such men of Italian birth as St. Benedict of Nursia, Pope Gregory I, St. Francis of Assisi, and the philosopher-theologians St. Anselm of Canterbury and St. Thomas Aquinas.\n\nNo land has made a greater contribution to the visual arts. In the 13th and 14th centuries there were the sculptors Nicola Pisano and his son Giovanni; the painters Cimabue, Duccio, and Giotto; and, later in the period, the sculptor Andrea Pisano. Among the many great artists of the 15th century — the golden age of Florence and Venice — were the architects Filippo Brunelleschi, Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Leon Battista Alberti; the sculptors Donatello, Luca della Robbia, Desiderio da Settignano, and Andrea del Verrocchio; and the painters Fra Angelico, Stefano di Giovanni, Paolo Uccello, Masaccio, Frà Filippo Lippi, Piero della Francesca, Giovanni Bellini, Andrea Mantegna, Antonio del Pollaiolo, Luca Signorelli, Pietro Perugino, Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Vittore Carpaccio.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the High Renaissance, Rome shared with Florence the leading position in the world of the arts. Major masters included the architects Donato Bramante and Andrea Palladio; the sculptor Benvenuto Cellini; the painter-designer-inventor Leonardo da Vinci; the painter-sculptor-architect Michelangelo Buonarroti; and the painters Titian, Giorgione, Raphael, Andrea del Sarto, and Antonio da Correggio. Among the great painters of the late Renaissance were Tintoretto and Paolo Veronese. Giorgio Vasari was a painter, architect, art historian, and critic.\n\nAmong the leading artists of the Baroque period were the sculptors-architects Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Francesco Borromini; the painters Caravaggio, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Canaletto, Pietro Longhi, and Francesco Guardi. Leading figures in modern painting were Umberto Boccioni, Amedeo Modigliani, Giorgio de Chirico, and Giorgio Morandi. A noted contemporary architect was Pier Luigi Nervi.\n\nthumb|200px|right|Andrea Palladio is often described as the most influential architect in the Western world.Weissmüller, Alberto. Palladio in Venice. Grafiche Vianello srl, 2005. p. 127. Web. 12 December 2013.\nthumb|200px|right|Antonio Meucci, c.1880, inventor of the first telephone\n\nMusic, an integral part of Italian life, owes many of its forms as well as its language to Italy. The musical staff was either invented or established by Guido of Arezzo. A leading 14th-century composer was the blind Florentine organist Francesco Landini. Leading composers of the High Renaissance and early Baroque periods were Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina; the madrigalists Luca Marenzio and Carlo Gesualdo, prince of Venosa; the Venetian organists Andrea Gabrieli and Giovanni Gabrieli; Claudio Monteverdi, one of the founders of opera; organist-composer Girolamo Frescobaldi; and Giacomo Carissimi. Important figures of the later Baroque era were Arcangelo Corelli, Antonio Vivaldi, Alessandro Scarlatti, and his son Domenico Scarlatti. Italian-born Luigi Cherubini was the central figure of French music in the Napoleonic era, while Antonio Salieri and Gaspare Spontini played important roles in the musical life of Vienna and Berlin, respectively. Composers of the 19th century who made their period the great age of Italian opera were Gioacchino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, Vincenzo Bellini, and, above all, Giuseppe Verdi. Niccolò Paganini was the greatest violinist of his time. More recent operatic composers include Ruggero Leoncavallo, Giacomo Puccini, and Pietro Mascagni. Renowned operatic singers include Enrico Caruso, Luisa Tetrazzini, Titta Ruffo, Amelita Galli-Curci, Beniamino Gigli, Ezio Pinza, and Luciano Pavarotti. Ferruccio Busoni, Ottorino Respighi, Luigi Dallapiccola, Luigi Nono, and Luciano Berio are major 20th-century composers. Arturo Toscanini is generally regarded as one of the greatest operatic and orchestral conductors of his time; two noted contemporary conductors are Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti. The foremost makers of stringed instruments were Gasparo da Salò of Brescia, Nicolò Amati, Antonio Stradivari, and Giuseppe Guarneri of Cremona. Bartolomeo Cristofori invented the piano.\n\nItalian literature and literary language began with Dante Alighieri, author of The Divine Comedy. Literary achievements — such as the poetry of Petrarch, Torquato Tasso, and Ludovico Ariosto and the prose of Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Baldassare Castiglione — exerted a tremendous and lasting influence on the subsequent development of Western culture. Outstanding film directors are Italian-born Frank Capra, Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Federico Fellini, Sergio Leone, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Franco Zeffirelli, Lina Wertmüller, and Bernardo Bertolucci. Famous film stars include Italian-born Rudolph Valentino, Marcello Mastroianni, and Sophia Loren.\n\nthumb|200px|left|Marchese Guglielmo Marconi was the inventor of radio.\n\nIn philosophy, exploration, and statesmanship, Italy has produced many world-renowned figures: the traveler Marco Polo; the statesman and patron of the arts Cosimo de' Medici; the statesman, clergyman, and artistic patron Rodrigo Borgia, who became Pope Alexander VI; the soldier, statesman, and artistic patron Lorenzo de' Medici, the son of Cosimo; the explorer John Cabot; the explorer Christopher Columbus; the explorer Amerigo Vespucci, after whom the Americas are named; the admiral and statesman Andrea Doria; Niccolò Machiavelli, author of The Prince and the outstanding political theorist of the Renaissance; the statesman and clergyman Cesare Borgia, the son of Rodrigo; the explorer Sebastian Cabot, the son of John; the historian Francesco Guicciardini; the explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano; the philosopher Bernardino Telesio; the mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher Giordano Bruno; the scholar Paolo Sarpi, so well versed in many fields of human knowledge to be called the \"Oracle of the century\"; the philosopher Tommaso Campanella; the Cardinal Mazarin, a statesman, diplomat, and prime minister under Lous XIV; the imperial field marshal and statesman Prince Eugene of Savoy; the political philosopher Giambattista Vico; the noted jurist Cesare Beccaria; Giuseppe Mazzini, the leading spirit of the Risorgimento; Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, its prime statesman; and Giuseppe Garibaldi, its foremost soldier and man of action. Notable intellectual and political leaders of more recent times include the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1907, Ernesto Teodoro Moneta; the sociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto; the political theorist Gaetano Mosca; the educator Maria Montessori; the philosopher, critic, and historian Benedetto Croce, with his idealistic antagonist Giovanni Gentile; Benito Mussolini, the founder of Fascism and dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943; Carlo Sforza and Alcide De Gasperi, famous latter-day statesmen; and the Communist leaders Antonio Gramsci, Palmiro Togliatti, and Enrico Berlinguer.\n\nItalian scientists and mathematicians of note include Fibonacci, Gerolamo Cardano, Galileo Galilei, Bonaventura Cavalieri, Evangelista Torricelli, Francesco Maria Grimaldi, Marcello Malpighi, Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia, Luigi Galvani, Alessandro Volta, Amedeo Avogadro, Stanislao Cannizzaro, Giuseppe Peano, Angelo Secchi, Camillo Golgi, Guglielmo Marconi, Maria Montessori, Antonio Meucci, Italian-American Enrico Fermi, Ettore Majorana, Emilio Segrè, Daniel Bovet, Rita Levi-Montalcini, and Italian-American Riccardo Giacconi.\n\n Language \n\nthumb|300px|right|\"Italophone\" world.   \n\nThe great Romantic English poet, Lord Byron, described Italian as a language that sounds \"as if it should be writ on satin.\" Byron's description is not an isolated expression of poetic fancy but, in fact, a popular view of the Italian language across the world, often called the language of \"love,\" \"poetry,\" and \"song.\"Clivio, Gianrenzo P. ; Danesi, Marcel. The Sounds, Forms, and Uses of Italian. University of Toronto Press, 2000. p. 3. Web. 31 October 2012.\n\nItalian, like English, belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. Like French and Spanish, it is a Romance language, one of the modern languages that developed from Latin. In particular, among the Romance languages, Italian is considered to be the closest to Latin in terms of vocabulary. It is spoken by about 60 million people in Italy, 23,000 in the Republic of San Marino, 400,000 in Switzerland, another 1,3 million in other European countries, and approximately 6 million in the Americas.\n\nStandard Italian evolved from a dialect spoken in Tuscany, given that it was the first region to produce great writers as Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio. Thanks to its cultural prestige, this dialect was adopted first in the Italian states, and then by the Kingdom of Italy after the unification in 1861. It may be considered somewhat intermediate, linguistically and geographically, between the Italo-Dalmatian languages of the South and the Gallo-Italic languages of the North, becoming the center of a dialect continuum. Its development was also influenced by the other Italian dialects and by the Germanic language of post-Roman invaders.\n\nThere are only a few communities in Italy in which Italian is not spoken as the first language, but many speakers are native bilinguals of both standardised Italian and other regional languages. These include native communities of Indo-European languages like Albanian, Croatian and Greek in southern Italy, Slovene and German varieties in Northern Italy, and dozens of various Romance languages, like Arpitan, Catalan, Friulan, Ladin, Lombard, Neapolitan, Occitan, Sardinian, Sicilian, and many others.\n\nToday, despite some regional variations, Italian is the most spoken language throughout the country. Many influences in Italy have helped standardize Italian. They include military service, education, and nationwide communication by means of newspapers, books, radio, and television.\n\n Libraries and museums \n\nthumb|left|160px|The Uffizi.\n\nItaly is one of the world's greatest centers of architecture, art, and books. Among its many of libraries, the most important are in the national library system, which contains two central libraries, in Florence (5.3 million volumes) and Rome (5 million), and four regional libraries, in Naples (1.8 million volumes), Milan (1 million), Turin (973,000) and Venice (917,000).Gall, Timothy L. ; Hobby, Jeneen M. Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations: Europe. Thomson Gale, 2007. pp. 367-368. Web. 01 Nov. 2012. The existence of two national central libraries, while most nations have one, came about through the history of the country, as Rome was once part of the Papal States and Florence was one of the first capitals of the unified Kingdom of Italy. While both libraries are designated as copyright libraries, Florence now serves as the site designated for conservation and cataloging of Italian publications and the site in Rome catalogs foreign publications acquired by the state libraries. All large Italian cities have public libraries.\n\nItaly, a world center of culture, history and art, has more than 3,000 museums. They contain, perhaps, the most important collections of artifacts from ancient civilizations. Taranto's museum, for example, offers material enabling scholars to probe deeply into the history of Magna Graecia. The archaeological collections in the Roman National Museum in Rome and in the National Archaeological Museum in Naples are probably among the world's best. Similarly, the Etruscan collection in the National Archaeological Museum of Umbria in Perugia, the classical sculptures in the Capitoline Museums in Rome, and the Egyptian collection in the Museo Egizio in Turin are, perhaps, the best such collections in the world.\n\nThe classical age is not the only age represented in Italy's museums. The Italian Renaissance is well represented in a number of museums: the Uffizi Gallery, Bargello Museum, and Palazzo Pitti are all located in Florence. Many of these museums, are the former palaces of kings or the houses of royal families.\n\n Cultural tourism \n\n Media \n\n Internet \n\nIn 1986, the first internet connection in Italy was experimented in Pisa, the third in Europe after Norway and England.The University of Pisa celebrates 25 years of being on the net. Università degli Studi di Pisa. Web. 1 December 2012. Already in the late 1970s, Pisan researchers, firstly with Luciano Lenzini, were in contact with U.S. researchers who had written the history of the Internet. Among them were Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who were the first to invent TCP and IP, the two protocols at the heart of the internet, and are hence considered the \"Fathers of the Internet\".\n\nCurrently Internet access is available to businesses and home users in various forms, including dial-up, cable, DSL, and wireless. The .it is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Italy. The .eu domain is also used, as it is shared with other European Union member states.\n\nAccording to data released by the fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) Council Europe, Italy represents one of the largest FTTH markets in Europe, with more than 2,5 million homes passed by fibre at end-December 2010;Will Italy have the best FTTH network in Europe? FTTH Council Europe. Web. 2 December 2012. at the same date the country reported around 348,000 fibre subscribers. The \"Fibre for Italy\" project (with the participation of providers Fastweb, Vodafone and Wind in a co-investment partnership) aims to reach 20 million people in Italy's 15 largest cities by 2015, and Telecom Italia plans to connect 138 cities by 2018. The government has also started the Italia Digitale project, which aims to provide at least 50% of Italians with high-speed internet access by 2020. The government aims to extend the fibre-optic network to rural areas.\n\nFigures published by the National Institute of Statistics showed at end-2011 that 58,8% of Italian families had a personal computer (up slightly from 57,6% in 2010); Cittadini e nuove tecnologie. Istituto nazionale di statistica. Web. 1 December 2012. 54,5% had access to the internet (up from 52,4%); and 45,8% had broadband access (up from 43,4%). Over one-fourth (26,3%, down slightly from 26,4% in 2010) of Italian internet users aged 14 and older made an online purchase during 2011.\n\n Newspapers and periodicals \n\nthumb|250px|left|The historic seat of the Corriere della Sera in via Solferino in Milan.\n\n, there were about 90 daily newspapers in the country, but not all of them had national circulation. According to Audipress statistics, the major daily newspapers (with their political orientations and estimated circulations) are: la Repubblica, left-wing, 3,276,000 in 2011; Dati Audipress 2011/II.

TV Sorrisi e Canzoni is the most popular news weekly with a circulation of 677,658 in July 2012. Settimanali — Luglio 2012. Prima Comunicazione. Web. 29 November 2012. The periodical press is becoming increasingly important. Among the most important periodicals are the pictorial weeklies — Oggi, L'Europeo, L'espresso, and Gente. Famiglia Cristiana is a Catholic weekly periodical with a wide readership.\n\nThe majority of papers are published in northern and central Italy, and circulation is highest in these areas. Rome and Milan are the most important publication centers. A considerable number of dailies are owned by the political parties, the Roman Catholic Church, and various economic groups. In general, the journalistic level of the Italian papers is high, and two dailies, Milan's Corriere della Sera and Turin's La Stampa, enjoy international respect.\n\nThe law provides for freedom of speech and the press, and the government is said to respect these rights in practice.\n\n Radio \n\nthumb|200px|right|Rai Radio 1.\n\nOf all the claimants to the title of the \"Father of Radio\", the one most associated with it is the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi.Huurdeman, Anton A. The Worldwide History of Telecommunications. John Wiley & Sons, 2003. p. 207. Web. 30 November 2012. He was the first person to send radio communication signals in 1895. By 1899 he flashed the first wireless signal across the English Channel and two years later received the letter \"S\", telegraphed from England to Newfoundland. This was the first successful transatlantic radiotelegraph message in 1902.\n\nToday, radio waves that are broadcast from thousands of stations, along with waves from other sources, fill the air around us continuously. Italy has three state-controlled radio networks that broadcast day and evening hours on both AM and FM. Program content varies from popular music to lectures, panel discussions, classical music, and opera, as well as frequent newscasts and feature reports. In addition, many private radio stations mix popular and classical music. A short-wave radio, though unnecessary, aids in reception of VOA, BBC, Vatican Radio in English and the Armed Forces Network in Germany and in other European stations.\n\n Television \n\nthumb|250px|left|Regional seat of RAI in Cosenza.\n\nThe first form of televised media in Italy was introduced in 1939, when the first experimental broadcasting began. However, this lasted for a very short time: when fascist Italy entered World War II in 1940, all the transmission were interrupted, and were resumed in earnest only nine years after the end of the conflict, in 1954.\n\nThere are two main national television organisations responsible for most viewing: state-owned RAI, funded by a yearly mandatory licence fee and Mediaset, commercial network founded by Silvio Berlusconi. Currently La7 is considered as the third major network in Italy, it is owned by Telecom Italia Media, the media branch of the telephone company Telecom Italia, which also owns 51% of MTV Italia. While many other networks are also present, both nationally and locally, RAI and Mediaset together, with their six traditional ex analogue stations plus a number of new free to air digital channels, reach almost 70% of the TV ratings.\n\nThe television networks offer varied programs, including news, operas, game shows, sitcoms, cartoons, plays, documentaries, musicals, and films-all in Italian. All programs are in color, except for the old black-and-white movies. Most Italians still depend on VHF/UHF reception, but both cable systems and direct satellite reception is increasingly common. Conventional satellite dishes can pick up European broadcasts, including some in English.\n\n Politics \n\nItaly set up its present form of government in 1946. That year, the people voted to change their nation from a monarchy ruled by a king to a republic headed by a president. King Umberto II immediately left the throne. The voters elected a group of 556 members, called a Constituent Assembly, to write a constitution. The Constitution was approved in 1947 and became effective on 1 January 1948. The Constitution established a governing system made up of a president, a cabinet called the Council of Ministers headed by a prime minister, and a Parliament made up of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies.\n\nthumb|Sergio Mattarella, President of the Italian Republic, elected on 3 February 2015.\n\nThe president of Italy is elected to a seven-year term by both houses of Parliament and a small number of regional representatives. The president must be at least 50 years old. He or she appoints the prime minister, who forms a government. The president has the power to dissolve Parliament and call new elections. The president is the commander of the Italian armed forces, and can declare war. The current President of the Italian Republic is Sergio Mattarella.\n\nItaly has no vice president. If the president of Italy becomes ill, the president of the Italian Senate takes over the office. If the president dies, a presidential election is held.\n\nThe prime minister determines national policy and is the most important person in the Italian government. The prime minister is selected by the president — usually from the members of Parliament — and must be approved by Parliament. The prime minister has no fixed term of office and can be voted out of office by Parliament at any time. The current Italian Prime Minister is Giuseppe Conte.\n\nMembers of the Cabinet are chosen by the prime minister, and they are usually selected from the members of Parliament. They are then appointed by the president and must be approved by Parliament. The Italian prime minister and the cabinet are officially called the government.\n\nItaly was a founding member of the European Community — now the European Union. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955 and is a member and strong supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the Council of Europe. Its recent turns in the rotating Presidency of international organisations include the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the forerunner of the OSCE, in 1994; G8; and the EU in 2001 and from July to December 2003.\n\n Religion \n\nthumb|left|Milan Cathedral is the fourth-largest church in the world.Charles, Victoria ; Carl, Klaus H. Gothic Art. Parkstone International, 2008. p. 81. Web. 17 November 2013.\n\nRoman Catholicism is by far the largest religion in the country. Although the Roman Catholic Church has been separated from the state, it still plays a role in the nation's political affairs partly due to Holy See's location in Vatican City, within Rome itself. Some 98% of Italians are Roman CatholicThe World Fact Book: People - Italy CIA.gov. Web. 24 September 2011. of which one-third are active members. Most baptisms, weddings, and funeral services are held in church.\n\nAn agreement called a \"Concordat\" governs since 1929 the relationship between Italy and the Roman Catholic Church. For instance, the agreement exempts priests and other members of religious orders from military service and gives tax exemptions to Catholic organizations.\n\nEven though the main Christian denomination in Italy is Roman Catholicism, there are some minorities of Protestant, Waldensian, Eastern Orthodox and other Christian churches. In the past two decades, Italy has received several waves of immigrants and as a result, some 825,000 Muslims (1.4%) live in Italy, as well as, 75,000 Hindus, 50,000 Buddhists, Unione Buddhista Italiana - UBI: L'Ente.  buddhismo.it. 24 September 2011. and a historical community of 30,000 Jewish members.\n\nIt is noteworthy to pinpoint that owing to the Italian Renaissance, church art in Italy is extraordinary, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Fra Carnevale, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Sandro Botticelli, Tintoretto, Titian, Raphael, and Giotto, etc. Italian church architecture is equally spectacular and historically important to Western culture, notably St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, Cathedral of St. Mark's in Venice, and Brunelleschi's Florence Cathedral, which includes the \"Gates of Paradise\" doors at the Baptistery by Lorenzo Ghiberti.\n\nSports\n\nthumb|The celebration of the Azzurri for the first victory (of four) in the 1934 World football championship\nthumb|A Ferrari SF70H by Scuderia Ferrari, the oldest surviving and most successful Formula One team.\n\nFootball is a popular spectator and participation sport. The Italian national team is among the very best in the world and has won the World Cup on four different occasions: 1934, 1938, 1982, and 2006. Only Brazil has a better record. Major Italian clubs frequently compete at a high level of European competitions. Amongst the players who won the FIFA World Cup there are Giuseppe Meazza, Silvio Piola (to date the highest goalscorer in Italian first league history), Dino Zoff, Paolo Rossi, Marco Tardelli, Bruno Conti, Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Del Piero, Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti. Other champions include Gianni Rivera, Luigi Riva (to date Italy's leading scorer of all time), Sandro Salvadore, Giacomo Bulgarelli, Pietro Anastasi, Giacinto Facchetti, Giampiero Boniperti, Romeo Benetti, Roberto Boninsegna, Roberto Bettega, Roberto Baggio and Paolo Maldini.\n\nItaly has also taken part in all the Winter Olympic Games, winning 114 medals, and 577 medals at the Summer Olympic Games. Italy has won a total of 246 gold medals which makes them the 6th most successful country in Olympic history, after the USA, the Soviet Union, Germany, Great Britain and France. Italy has the sixth highest medal total of all time with 701.\n\nRugby union is also recognised in Italy; clubs compete domestically in the Super 10, as well as the European Heineken Cup tournament. The National team has progressed significantly during the decades and achieved good results in the second half of the 1990s, when they managed to beat historical teams. The national team competes in the Six Nations Championship, and is a regular at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nCycling is also a well-represented sport in Italy. Italians are second only to Belgium in winning the most World Cycling Championships. The Giro d'Italia is a world-famous long-distance bicycle race held every May and constitutes one of the three Grand Tours along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, each of which last approximately three weeks.\nTennis has a significant following near courts and on television. Italian professional tennis players are almost always in the top 100 world ranking of male and female players. Beach tennis with paddle racquet was invented by Italians, and is practised by many people across the country.\nVolleyball is played by a lot of amateur players and professional players compete in the Italian Volleyball League, regarded as the best and most difficult volleyball league in the world. The male and female national teams are often in the top 4 ranking of teams in the world.\n\nScuderia Ferrari is the oldest surviving team in Grand Prix racing, having competed since 1948, and statistically the most successful Formula One team in history, with a record of 15 Drivers' Championships and 16 Constructors' Championships. Also, motorcycle racers such as Giacomo Agostini and Valentino Rossi are recognized as some of the greatest sportstars of all time.\n\nFederica Pellegrini, one of the few female swimmers to have set world records in more than one event has been one of the world's most successful swimmers. Italian athletes have won 549 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 114 medals at the Winter Olympic Games. Jessica Rossi scored a Shooting sport world record of 75 in the qualification and a world record of 99. Fencing is a very successful sport and Italy is one of the most successful fencing countries; Edoardo Mangiarotti is the world's most successful fencer, with 39 Olympic titles and World championships won. In wrestling, one of the most remarkable wrestlers is Bruno Sammartino, who held the record of the WWWF (World) Heavyweight Championship for over 11 years across two reigns, the first of which is the longest single reign in the promotion's history.\nOther very popular sports in Italy are basketball, athletics, and boxing.\n\nSee also\n Italian philosophy\n List of cultural icons of Italy\n National symbols of Italy\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Marrazzo, N.

    "text": "In mathematical logic, the disjunction and existence properties are the \"hallmarks\" of constructive theories such as Heyting arithmetic and constructive set theories (Rathjen 2005). \n\n Disjunction property \nThe disjunction property is satisfied by a theory if, whenever a sentence A ∨ B  is a theorem, then either A is a theorem, or B is a theorem.\n\n Existence property \n\nThe existence property or witness property is satisfied by a theory if, whenever a sentence  is a theorem, where A(x) has no other free variables, then there is some term t such that the theory proves .\n\n Related properties \n\nRathjen (2005) lists five properties that a theory may possess. These include the disjunction property (DP), the existence property (EP), and three additional properties:\n\n The numerical existence property (NEP) states that if the theory proves , where φ has no other free variables, then the theory proves  for some  Here  is a term in  representing the number n.\n Church's rule (CR) states that if the theory proves  then there is a natural number e such that, letting  be the computable function with index e, the theory proves . \n A variant of Church's rule, CR1, states that if the theory proves  then there is a natural number e such that the theory proves  is total and proves .\n\nThese properties can only be directly expressed for theories that have the ability to quantify over natural numbers and, for CR1, quantify over functions from  to . In practice, one may say that a theory has one of these properties if a definitional extension of the theory has the property stated above (Rathjen 2005).\n\n Background and history \n\nKurt Gödel (1932) stated without proof that intuitionistic propositional logic (with no additional axioms) has the disjunction property; this result was proven and extended to intuitionistic predicate logic by Gerhard Gentzen (1934, 1935). Stephen Cole Kleene (1945) proved that Heyting arithmetic has the disjunction property and the existence property. Kleene's method introduced the technique of realizability, which is now one of the main methods in the study of constructive theories (Kohlenbach 2008; Troelstra 1973).\n\nWhile the earliest results were for constructive theories of arithmetic, many results are also known for constructive set theories (Rathjen 2005). John Myhill (1973) showed that IZF with the axiom of Replacement eliminated in favor of the axiom of Collection has the disjunction property, the numerical existence property, and the existence property. Michael Rathjen (2005) proved that CZF has the disjunction property and the numerical existence property.\n\nMost classical theories, such as Peano arithmetic and ZFC do not have the existence or disjunction property. Some classical theories, such as ZFC plus the axiom of constructibility, do have a weaker form of the existence property (Rathjen 2005).\n\n In topoi \nFreyd and Scedrov (1990) observed that the disjunction property holds in free Heyting algebras and free topoi. In categorical terms, in the free topos, that corresponds to the fact that the terminal object, , is not the join of two proper subobjects. Together with the existence property it translates to the assertion that  is an indecomposable projective object – the functor it represents (the global-section functor) preserves epimorphisms and coproducts.\n\n Relationships \n\nThere are several relationship between the five properties discussed above.\n\nIn the setting of arithmetic, the numerical existence property implies the disjunction property. The proof uses the fact that a disjunction can be rewritten as an existential formula quantifying over natural numbers:\n .\nTherefore, if  is a theorem of , so is . Thus, assuming the numerical existence property, there exists some  such that  is a theorem. Since  is a numeral, one may concretely check the value of : if  then  is a theorem and if  then  is a theorem.\n\nHarvey Friedman (1974) proved that in any recursively enumerable extension of intuitionistic arithmetic, the disjunction property implies the numerical existence property. The proof uses self-referential sentences in way similar to the proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. The key step is to find a bound on the existential quantifier in a formula (∃x)A(x), producing a \nbecause bounded existential formula\n(∃x<n)A(x). The bounded formula may then be written as a finite disjunction A(1)∨A(2)∨...∨A(n). Finally, disjunction elimination may be used to show that one of the disjuncts is provable.\n\n References \n\n Petre J. Freyd and Andre Scedrov, 1990, Categories, Allegories.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Interlingua",
    "text": "The history of Interlingua comprises the formation of the language itself as well as its community of speakers.\n\nUltimate credit for Interlingua must go to the American heiress Alice Vanderbilt Morris (1874–1950), who became interested in linguistics and the international auxiliary language movement in the early 1920s. In 1924, Morris and her husband, Dave Hennen Morris, established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in New York City. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis.Falk, Julia S. \"Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States, Language and Communication, 15(3): pp. 241-259. Pergamon, 1995.\n\nInvestigations of the auxiliary language problem were in progress at the International Research Council, the American Council on Education, the American Council of Learned Societies, the British, French, Italian, and American Associations for the advancement of science, and other groups of specialists. Morris created IALA as a continuation of this work.Bray, Mary Connell [1951] (1971), \"Foreword\", Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international Language, Second Edition, New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company. . OCLC 162319. Retrieved on 2007-03-05. She developed the research program of IALA in consultation with Edward Sapir, William Edward Collinson, and Otto Jespersen.\n\n International Auxiliary Language Association \n\nThe IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, Sapir's cross-linguistic semantic studies of totality (1930) and grading phenomena (1944). Morris herself edited Sapir and Morris Swadesh's 1932 cross-linguistic study of ending-point phenomena, and Collinson's 1937 study of indication. Although the Morrises and their family provided most of IALA's funding, it also received support from such prestigious groups as the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nIn its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about languages and interlinguistics; and comparing extant IALs, including Esperanto, Esperanto II, Ido, Peano’s Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Novial, and Interlingue (Occidental). In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities.  It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, debating features and goals of their representative languages. With a \"concession rule\" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive.\n\nAt the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in Geneva in 1931, IALA began to break new ground. Its conference was attended by recognized linguists, 27 of whom signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in Rome in 1933.\n\nAlso in 1933, Professor Herbert N. Shenton of Syracuse University organized an intensive study of the problems encountered with interlanguages when used in international conferences. Later that same year, Dr. Edward L. Thorndike published a paper about the relative learning speeds of \"natural\" and \"modular\" constructed languages. Both Shenton and Thorndike were major influences on IALA's work from then on.\n\nIn 1937, the first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary. However, the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.\n\nDevelopment of a new language\nOriginally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing interlanguages were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, \"Profunde recerca duce a un lingua\", Historia de interlingua, 2001, revised 2006.\n\nTo that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., Novial and Occidental) or systematic (e.g., Esperanto and Ido) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Dr. Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many – or even a majority – of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a Procrustean bed, forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where E. Clark Stillman established a new research staff.  Stillman, with the assistance of Dr. Alexander Gode, developed a prototyping technique – an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of control languages.\n\nIn 1943 Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research. In 1945, IALA published a General Report – largely Morris's work – which presented three models for IALA's language:\n Model P was a naturalistic model that made no attempt to regularize the prototyped vocabulary.\n Model E was lightly schematicized along the lines of Occidental.\n Model K was moderately schematicized along the lines of Ido (i.e., somewhat less schematicized than Esperanto).\n\nFrom 1946 to 1948, the renowned French linguist André Martinet was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. An initial survey gauged reactions to the three models of 1945. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, \"Le natura, si – un schema, no\", Historia de interlingua, 2001, revised 2006.\n\nThe four models\nFour models were canvassed: Model P and K, plus two new models similar to Model E of 1945.\n\n    Model P     highly naturalistic     Jo habe nascite, o dea cum le oculos azure, de parentes barbare, inter le bone et virtuose Cimmerios    Model M     moderately naturalistic    Io have nascit, o dea con le ocules azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuos Cimmerios     Model C     slightly schematic    Yo ha nascet, o deessa con le ocules azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuose Cimerios     Model K     moderately schematic    Yo naskeba, o dea kon le okuli azure, de parenti barbare, inter le bone e virtuose Kimerii     (modern Interlingua)    Io ha nascite, o dea con le oculos azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuose Cimmerios    (English)    'I was born, O goddess with the blue eyes, of barbarian relations, among the good and virtuous Cimmerians'\n\nModel P was unchanged from 1945; Model M was relatively modern in comparison to more classical P. Model K was slightly modified in the direction of Ido.\n\nThe vote total ended up as follows: P 26.6%, M 37.5%, C 20%, and K 15%. The results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models, C and K, were rejected – K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M attracted somewhat more support than P. Taking national biases into account (for example, the French who were polled disproportionately favored Model M), IALA decided on a compromise between models M and P, with certain elements of C.\n\nFinalization\nWhen Martinet took up a position at Columbia University in 1948, Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development.  His task was to combine elements of Model M and Model P; take the flaws seen in both by the polled community and repair them with elements of Model C as needed; and simultaneously develop a vocabulary.\n\nThe vocabulary and verb conjugations of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized Interlingua Grammar and the 27,000-word Interlingua-English Dictionary (IED). In 1954, IALA  published an introductory manual entitled Interlingua a Prime Vista (\"Interlingua at First Sight\").\n\nSuccess, decline, and resurgence\n \nAn early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter Spectroscopia Molecular, published from 1952 to 1980.Breinstrup, Thomas, \"Un revolution in le mundo scientific\" (A revolution in the scientific world). Accessed January 16, 2007. In 1954 Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress, in Washington DC, for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. Science Service, the publisher of Science Newsletter at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the powerful International Organization for Standardization, which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries.\n\nThe IALA closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later.Esterhill, Frank, Interlingua Institute: A History. New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.  Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service,F. P., and Sexton, B. C., Gopsill, \"Le natura, si – un schema, no\".

    "title": "Implementation of mathematics in set theory",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_of_mathematics_in_set_theory",
    "text": "This article examines the implementation of mathematical concepts in set theory. The implementation of a number of basic mathematical concepts is carried out in parallel in ZFC (the dominant set theory) and in NFU, the version of Quine's New Foundations shown to be consistent by R. B. Jensen in 1969 (here understood to include at least axioms of Infinity and Choice).\n\nWhat is said here applies also to two families of set theories: on the one hand, a range of theories including Zermelo set theory near the lower end of the scale and going up to ZFC extended with large cardinal hypotheses such as \"there is a measurable cardinal\"; and on the other hand a hierarchy of extensions of NFU which is surveyed in the New Foundations article. These correspond to different general views of what the set-theoretical universe is like, and it is the approaches to implementation of mathematical concepts under these two general views that are being compared and contrasted.\n\nIt is not the primary aim of this article to say anything about the relative merits of these theories as foundations for mathematics. The reason for the use of two different set theories is to illustrate that multiple approaches to the implementation of mathematics are feasible. Precisely because of this approach, this article is not a source of \"official\" definitions for any mathematical concept.\n\nPreliminaries\n\nThe following sections carry out certain constructions in the two theories ZFC and NFU and compare the resulting implementations of certain mathematical structures (such as the natural numbers).\n\nMathematical theories prove theorems (and nothing else). So saying that a theory allows the construction of a certain object means that it is a theorem of that theory that that object exists. This is a statement about a definition of the form \"the x such that  exists\", where  is a formula of our language: the theory proves the existence of \"the x such that \" just in case it is a theorem that \"there is one and only one x such that \". (See Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions.) Loosely, the theory \"defines\" or \"constructs\" this object in this case. If the statement is not a theorem, the theory cannot show that the object exists; if the statement is provably false in the theory, it proves that the object cannot exist; loosely, the object cannot be constructed.\n\nZFC and NFU share the language of set theory, so the same formal definitions \"the x such that \" can be contemplated in the two theories. A specific form of definition in the language of set theory is set-builder notation:  means \"the set A such that for all x, \" (A cannot be free in ). This notation admits certain conventional extensions:  is synonymous with ;  is defined as , where  is an expression already defined.\n\nExpressions definable in set-builder notation make sense in both ZFC and NFU: it may be that both theories prove that a given definition succeeds, or that neither do (the expression  fails to refer to anything in any set theory with classical logic; in class theories like NBG this notation does refer to a class, but it is defined differently), or that one does and the other doesn't. Further, an object defined in the same way in ZFC and NFU may turn out to have different properties in the two theories (or there may be a difference in what can be proved where there is no provable difference between their properties).\n\nFurther, set theory imports concepts from other branches of mathematics (in intention, all branches of mathematics). In some cases, there are different ways to import the concepts into ZFC and NFU. For example, the usual definition of the first infinite ordinal  in ZFC is not suitable for NFU because the object (defined in purely set theoretical language as the set of all finite von Neumann ordinals) cannot be shown to exist in NFU. The usual definition of  in NFU is (in purely set theoretical language) the set of all infinite well-orderings all of whose proper initial segments are finite, an object which can be shown not to exist in ZFC. In the case of such imported objects, there may be different definitions, one for use in ZFC and related theories, and one for use in NFU and related theories. For such \"implementations\" of imported mathematical concepts to make sense, it is necessary to be able to show that the two parallel interpretations have the expected properties: for example, the implementations of the natural numbers in ZFC and NFU are different, but both are implementations of the same mathematical structure, because both include definitions for all the primitives of Peano arithmetic and satisfy (the translations of) the Peano axioms. It is then possible to compare what happens in the two theories as when only set theoretical language is in use, as long as the definitions appropriate to ZFC are understood to be used in the ZFC context and the definitions appropriate to NFU are understood to be used in the NFU context.\n\nWhatever is proven to exist in a theory clearly provably exists in any extension of that theory; moreover, analysis of the proof that an object exists in a given theory may show that it exists in weaker versions of that theory (one may consider Zermelo set theory instead of ZFC for much of what is done in this article, for example).\n\n Empty set, singleton, unordered pairs and tuples \nThese constructions appear first because they are the simplest constructions in set theory, not because they are the first constructions that come to mind in mathematics (though the notion of finite set is certainly fundamental!)  \nEven though NFU also allows the construction of set ur-elements yet to become members of a set, the empty set is the unique set with no members:  \n\nFor each object , there is a set  with  as its only element:  \n\nFor objects  and , there is a set  containing  and  as its only elements:  \n\nThe union of two sets is defined in the usual way:  \n\nThis is a recursive definition of unordered -tuples for any concrete  (finite sets given as lists of their elements:)  \n\nIn NFU, all the set definitions given work by stratified comprehension; in ZFC, the existence of the unordered pair is given by the axiom of Pairing, the existence of the empty set follows by Separation from the existence of any set, and the boolean union of two sets exists by the axioms of Pairing and Union ().\n\n Ordered pair \n\nFirst, consider the ordered pair. The reason that this comes first is technical: ordered pairs are needed to implement relations and functions which are needed to implementat other concepts which may seem to be prior.\nThe first definition of the ordered pair was the definition  proposed by Norbert Wiener in 1914 in the context of the type theory of Principia Mathematica. Wiener observed that this allowed the elimination of types of n-ary relations for  from the system of that work.\nIt is more usual now to use the definition , due to Kuratowski.\nEither of these definitions works in either ZFC or NFU. In NFU, these two definitions have a technical disadvantage: the Kuratowski ordered pair is two types higher than its projections, while the Wiener ordered pair is three types higher. It is common to postulate the existence of a type-level ordered pair (a pair  which is the same type as its projections) in NFU. It is convenient to use the Kuratowski pair in both systems until the use of type-level pairs can be formally justified.\nThe internal details of these definitions have nothing to do with their actual mathematical function. For any notion  of ordered pair, the things that matter are that it satisfy the defining condition:\n \n…and that it be reasonably easy to collect ordered pairs into sets.\n\n Relations \nRelations are sets whose members are all ordered pairs. Where possible, a relation  (understood as a binary predicate) is implemented as  (which may be written as ). Where  is a set of ordered pairs, read  as .\n\nIn ZFC, some relations (such as the general equality relation or subset relation on sets) are 'too large'\nto be sets (but may be harmlessly reified as proper classes). In NFU, some relations (such as the membership relation) are not sets because their definitions are not stratified: in    and  would\nneed to have the same type (because they appear as projections of the same pair), but also\nsuccessive types (because  is considered as an element of ).\n\n Related definitions \nLet  and  be given binary relations. Then the following concepts are useful:\n\nThe converse of  is the relation .\n\nThe domain of  is the set .\n\nThe range of  is the domain of the converse of .\n\nThe field of  is the union of the domain and range of .\n\nThe preimage of a member  of the field of  is the set  (used in the definition of 'well-founded' below.)\n\nThe downward closure of a member  of the field of  is the smallest set  containing , and containing each  for each  (i.e., including the preimage of each of its elements with respect to  as a subset.)\n\nThe relative product  of  and  is the relation .\n\nIn ZFC, one proves that these notions all generate or apply to sets via the ZFC axioms of union, separation, and power set. In NFU, it is easy to check that these definitions give rise to stratified formulas.\n\nNotice that the range and codomain of a relation are not distinguished: this could be done by representing a relation  with codomain  as , but our development will not require this.\n\nIn ZFC, any relation whose domain is a subset of a set  and whose range is a subset of a set  will be a set, since the cartesian product  is a set (being a subclass of ), and Separation provides for the existence of . In NFU, some relations with global scope (such as equality and subset) can be implemented as sets. In NFU, bear in mind that  and  are three types lower than  in  (one type lower if a type-level ordered pair is used).\n\n Properties and kinds of relations \nLet  be some binary relation.  is:\nReflexive if  for every  in the field of .\n Symmetric if .\n Transitive if .\n Antisymmetric if .\n Well-founded if for every set  which meets the field of ,  whose preimage under  does not meet .\n Extensional if for every  in the field of ,  if and only if  and  have the same preimage under .\n\nRelations having certain combinations of the above properties have standard names.  is:\n\n An equivalence relation if  is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n A partial order if  is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.\n A linear order if  is a partial order and for every  in the field of , either  or .\n A well-ordering if  is a linear order and well-founded.\n A set picture if  is well-founded and extensional, and the field of  either equals the downward closure of one of its members (called its top element), or is empty.\n\n Functions \nA functional relation is a binary predicate  such that . Such a relation (predicate) is implemented as a relation (set) exactly as described in the previous section. So the predicate  is implemented by the set . A set of ordered pairs  is a function if and only if . It is therefore possible to define this function  as the unique object  such that  – i.e.:   is -related to  such that the relation  holds between  and  – or as the unique object  such that . The presence in both theories of functional predicates which are not sets makes it useful to allow the notation  both for sets  and for important functional predicates. As long as one does not quantify over functions in the latter sense, all such uses are in principle eliminable.\n\nIn NFU,  has the same type as , and  is three types higher than  (one type higher, if a type-level ordered pair is used). To solve this problem, one could define  as  for any set , but this is more conveniently written as . Then, if  is a set and  is any functional relation, the 'axiom of replacement' assures that  is a set in ZFC. In NFU,  and  now have the same type, and  is two types higher than  (the same type, if a type-level ordered pair is used).\n\nThe function  is not a set in ZFC because it is 'too large.'   is, however, a set in NFU. The function (predicate)  is neither a function nor a set in either theory; in ZFC, this is true because such a set would be too large, and, in NFU, this is true because its definition would not be stratified. Moreover,  can be proved not to exist in NFU (see the resolution of Cantor's paradox in New Foundations.)\n\n Operations on functions \nLet  and  be arbitrary functions. The composition of  and , , is defined as the relative product , but only if this results in a function such that  is also a function, with , if the range of  is a subset of the domain of . The inverse of , , is defined as the converse of  if this is a function. Given any set , the identity function  is the set , and this is a set in both ZFC and NF for different reasons.\n\n Special kinds of function \nA function is an injection and one-to-one if it has an inverse function.\n\nIf  and  are sets,  is a function from  to  if  is a function whose domain is , and whose range is included in .\n\nIf  is a function from  to ,  is a:\n Injection from  to  if the images under  of distinct members of  are distinct members of .\n Surjection from  to  if the range of  is .\n Bijection from  to  if  is both an injection and a surjection.\n\nThis terminology adjusts for the fact that a function, as defined above, does not determine its codomain.\n\n Size of sets \n\nIn both ZFC and NFU, two sets A and B are the same size (or are equinumerous) if and only if there is a bijection f from A to B. This can be written as , but note that (for the moment) this expresses a relation between A and B rather than a relation between yet-undefined objects  and . Denote this relation by  in contexts such as the actual definition of the cardinals where even the appearance of presupposing abstract cardinals should be avoided.\n\nSimilarly, define  as holding if and only if there is an injection from A to B.\n\nIt is straightforward to show that the relation of equinumerousness is an equivalence relation: equinumerousness of A with A is witnessed by ; if f witnesses , then  witnesses ; if f witnesses  and g witnesses , then  witnesses .\n\nIt can be shown that  is a linear order on abstract cardinals, but not on sets. Reflexivity is obvious and transitivity is proven just as for equinumerousness. The Schröder–Bernstein theorem, provable in ZFC and NFU in an entirely standard way, establishes that\n\n(this establishes antisymmetry on cardinals), and\n\nfollows in a standard way in either theory from the axiom of choice.\n\n Finite sets and natural numbers \n\nNatural numbers can be considered either as finite ordinals or finite cardinals. Here consider them as finite cardinal numbers. This is the first place where a major difference between the implementations in ZFC and NFU becomes evident.\n\nThe Axiom of Infinity of ZFC tells us that there is a set A which contains  and contains  for each . This set A is not uniquely determined (it can be made larger while preserving this closure property): the set N of natural numbers is\n\nwhich is the intersection of all sets which contain the empty set and are closed under the \"successor\" operation .\n\nIn ZFC, a set  is finite if and only if there is  such that : further, define  as this n for finite A. (It can be proved that no two distinct natural numbers are the same size).\n\nThe usual operations of arithmetic can be defined recursively and in a style very similar to that in which the set of natural numbers itself is defined. For example, + (the addition operation on natural numbers) can be defined as the smallest set which contains  for each natural number  and contains  whenever it contains .\n\nIn NFU, it is not obvious that this approach can be used, since the successor operation  is unstratified and so the set N as defined above cannot be shown to exist in NFU (it is consistent for the set of finite von Neumann ordinals to exist in NFU, but this strengthens the theory, as the existence of this set implies the Axiom of Counting (for which see below or the New Foundations article)).\n\nThe standard definition of the natural numbers, which is actually the oldest set-theoretic definition of natural numbers, is as equivalence classes of finite sets under equinumerousness. Essentially the same definition is appropriate to NFU (this is not the usual definition, but the results are the same): define Fin, the set of finite sets, as\n\nFor any set , define  as . Define N as the set .\n\nThe Axiom of Infinity of NFU can be expressed as : this is enough to establish that each natural number has a nonempty successor (the successor of  being  for any ) which is the hard part of showing that the Peano axioms of arithmetic are satisfied.\n\nThe operations of arithmetic can be defined in a style similar to the style given above (using the definition of successor just given). They can also be defined in a natural set theoretical way: if A and B are disjoint finite sets, define |A|+|B| as . More formally, define m+n for m and n in N as\n\n(But note that this style of definition is feasible for the ZFC numerals as well, but more circuitous: the form of the NFU definition facilitates set manipulations while the form of the ZFC definition facilitates recursive definitions, but either theory supports either style of definition).\n\nThe two implementations are quite different. In ZFC, choose a representative of each finite cardinality (the equivalence classes themselves are too large to be sets); in NFU the equivalence classes themselves are sets, and are thus an obvious choice for objects to stand in for the cardinalities. However, the arithmetic of the two theories is identical: the same abstraction is implemented by these two superficially different approaches.\n\n Equivalence relations and partitions \n\nA general technique for implementing abstractions in set theory is the use of equivalence classes. If an equivalence relation R tells us that elements of its field A are alike in some particular respect, then for any set x, regard the set  as representing an abstraction from the set x respecting just those features (identify elements of A up to R).\n\nFor any set A, a set  is a partition of A if all elements of P are nonempty, any two distinct elements of P are disjoint, and .\n\nFor every equivalence relation R with field A,  is a partition of A. Moreover, each partition P of A determines an equivalence relation .\n\nThis technique has limitations in both ZFC and NFU. In ZFC, since the universe is not a set, it seems possible to abstract features only from elements of small domains. This can be circumvented using a trick due to Dana Scott: if R is an equivalence relation on the universe, define  as the set of all y such that  and the rank of y is less than or equal to the rank of any . This works because the ranks are sets. Of course, there still may be a proper class of 's. In NFU, the main difficulty is that  is one type higher than x, so for example the \"map\"  is not in general a (set) function (though  is a set). This can be circumvented by the use of the Axiom of Choice to select a representative from each equivalence class to replace , which will be at the same type as x, or by choosing a canonical representative if there is a way to do this without invoking Choice (the use of representatives is hardly unknown in ZFC, either). In NFU, the use of equivalence class constructions to abstract properties of general sets is more common, as for example in the definitions of cardinal and ordinal number below.\n\n Ordinal numbers \n\nTwo well-orderings  and  are similar and write  just in case there is a bijection f from the field of  to the field of  such that  for all x and y.\n\nSimilarity is shown to be an equivalence relation in much the same way that equinumerousness was shown to be an equivalence relation above.\n\nIn New Foundations (NFU), the order type of a well-ordering W is the set of all well-orderings which are similar to W. The set of ordinal numbers is the set of all order types of well-orderings.\n\nThis does not work in ZFC, because the equivalence classes are too large. It would be formally possible to use Scott's trick to define the ordinals in essentially the same way, but a device of von Neumann is more commonly used.\n\nFor any partial order , the corresponding strict partial order < is defined as . Strict linear orders and strict well-orderings are defined similarly.\n\nA set A is said to be transitive if : each element of an element of A is also an element of A. A (von Neumann) ordinal is a transitive set on which membership is a strict well-ordering.\n\nIn ZFC, the order type of a well-ordering W is then defined as the unique von Neumann ordinal which is equinumerous with the field of W and membership on which is isomorphic to the strict well-ordering associated with W. (the equinumerousness condition distinguishes between well-orderings with fields of size 0 and 1, whose associated strict well-orderings are indistinguishable).\n\nIn ZFC there cannot be a set of all ordinals. In fact, the von Neumann ordinals are an inconsistent totality in any set theory: it can be shown with modest set theoretical assumptions that every element of a von Neumann ordinal is a von Neumann ordinal and the von Neumann ordinals are strictly well-ordered by membership. It follows that the class of von Neumann ordinals would be a von Neumann ordinal if it were a set: but it would then be an element of itself, which contradicts the fact that membership is a strict well-ordering of the von Neumann ordinals.\n\nThe existence of order types for all well-orderings is not a theorem of Zermelo set theory: it requires the Axiom of replacement. Even Scott's trick cannot be used in Zermelo set theory without an additional assumption (such as the assumption that every set belongs to a rank which is a set, which does not essentially\nstrengthen Zermelo set theory but is not a theorem of that theory).\n\nIn NFU, the collection of all ordinals is a set by stratified comprehension. The Burali-Forti paradox is evaded in an unexpected way. There is a natural order on the ordinals defined by  if and only if some (and so any)  is similar to an initial segment of some (and so any) . Further, it can be shown that this natural order is a well-ordering of the ordinals and so must have an order type . It would seem that the order type of the ordinals less than\n with the natural order would be , contradicting the fact that  is the order type of the entire natural order on the ordinals (and so not of any of its proper initial segments). But this relies on one's intuition (correct in ZFC) that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than  is  for any ordinal . This assertion is unstratified, because the type of the second  is four higher than the type of the first (two higher if a type level pair is used). The assertion which is true and provable in NFU is that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than  is  for any ordinal , where  is the order type of  for any  (it is easy to show that this does not depend on the choice of W; note that T raises type by one). Thus the order type of the ordinals less than  with the natural order is , and . All uses of  here can be replaced with  if a type-level pair is used.\n\nThis shows that the T operation is nontrivial, which has a number of consequences. It follows immediately that the singleton map  is not a set, as otherwise restrictions of this map would establish the similarity of W and  for any well-ordering W. T is (externally) bijective and order-preserving. Because of this, the fact  establishes that  is a \"descending sequence\" in the ordinals which cannot be a set.\n\nOrdinals fixed by T are called Cantorian ordinals, and ordinals which dominate only cantorian ordinals (which are easily shown to be cantorian themselves) are said to be strongly cantorian. There can be no set of cantorian ordinals or set of strongly cantorian ordinals.\n\n Digression: von Neumann ordinals in NFU \n\nIt is possible to reason about von Neumann ordinals in NFU. Recall that a von Neumann ordinal is a transitive set A such that the restriction of membership to A is a strict well-ordering. This is quite a strong condition in the NFU context, since the membership relation involves a difference of type. A von Neumann ordinal A is not an ordinal in the sense of NFU, but  belongs to an ordinal  which may be termed the order type of (membership on) A. It is easy to show that the order type of a von Neumann ordinal A is cantorian: for any well-ordering W of order type , the induced well-ordering of initial segments of W by inclusion has order type  (it is one type higher, thus the application of T): but the order types of the well-ordering of a von Neumann ordinal A by membership and the well-ordering of its initial segments by inclusion are clearly the same because the two well-orderings are actually the same relation, so the order type of A is fixed under T. Moreover, the same argument applies to any smaller ordinal (which will be the order type of an initial segment of A, also a von Neumann ordinal) so the order type of any von Neumann ordinal is strongly cantorian.\n\nThe only von Neumann ordinals which can be shown to exist in NFU without additional assumptions are the concrete finite ones. However, the application of a permutation method can convert any model of NFU to a model in which every strongly cantorian ordinal is the order type of a von Neumann ordinal. This suggests that the concept \"strongly cantorian ordinal of NFU\" might be a better analogue to \"ordinal of ZFC\" than is the apparent analogue \"ordinal of NFU\".\n\n Cardinal numbers \n\nCardinal numbers are defined in NFU in a way which generalizes the definition of natural\nnumber: for any set A, .\n\nIn ZFC, these equivalence classes are too large as usual. Scott's trick could be used (and indeed is used in ZF),  is usually defined as the smallest order type (here a von Neumann ordinal) of a well-ordering of A (that every set can be well-ordered follows from\nthe Axiom of Choice in the usual way in both theories).\n\nThe natural order on cardinal numbers is seen to be a well-ordering: that it is reflexive, antisymmetric (on abstract cardinals, which are now available) and transitive has been shown above. That it is a linear order follows from the Axiom of Choice: well-order two sets and an \ninitial segment of one well-ordering will be isomorphic to the other, so one set will have cardinality smaller than that of the other. That it is a well-ordering follows from the Axiom of Choice in a similar way.\n\nWith each infinite cardinal, many order types are associated for the usual reasons (in either set theory).\n\nCantor's theorem shows (in both theories) that there are nontrivial distinctions between infinite cardinal numbers. In ZFC, one proves  In NFU, the usual form of Cantor's theorem is false (consider the case A=V), but Cantor's theorem is an ill-typed statement. The correct form of the theorem in NFU is , where  is the set of one-element subsets of A.  shows that there are \"fewer\" singletons than sets (the obvious bijection  from  to V has already been seen not to be a set). It is actually provable in NFU + Choice that  (where  signals the existence of many intervening cardinals; there are many, many urelements!). Define a type-raising T operation on cardinals analogous to the T operation on ordinals: ; this is an external endomorphism of the cardinals just as the T operation on ordinals is an external endomorphism of the ordinals.\n\nA set A is said to be cantorian just in case ; the cardinal  is also said to be a cantorian cardinal. A set A is said to be strongly cantorian (and its cardinal to be strongly cantorian as well) just in case the restriction of the singleton map to A () is a set. Well-orderings of strongly cantorian sets are always strongly cantorian ordinals; this is not always true of well-orderings of cantorian sets (though the shortest well-ordering of a cantorian set will be cantorian). A cantorian set is a set which satisfies the usual form of Cantor's theorem.\n\nThe operations of cardinal arithmetic are defined in a set-theoretically motivated way in both theories. . One would like to define  as , and one does this in ZFC, but there is an obstruction in NFU when using the Kuratowski pair: one defines  as  because of the type displacement of 2 between the pair and its projections, which implies a type displacement of two between a cartesian product and its factors. It is straightforward to prove that the product always exists (but requires attention because the inverse of T is not total).\n\nDefining the exponential operation on cardinals requires T in an essential way: if  was defined as the collection of functions from A to B, this is three types higher than A or B, so it is reasonable to define  as  so that it is the same type as A or B ( replaces  with type-level pairs). An effect of this is that the exponential operation is partial: for example,  is undefined. In ZFC one defines  as  without difficulty.\n\nThe exponential operation is total and behaves exactly as expected on cantorian cardinals, since T fixes such cardinals and it is easy to show that a function space between cantorian sets is cantorian (as are power sets, cartesian products, and other usual type constructors). This offers further encouragement to the view that the \"standard\" cardinalities in NFU are the cantorian (indeed, the strongly cantorian) cardinalities, just as the \"standard\" ordinals seem to be the strongly cantorian ordinals.\n\nNow the usual theorems of cardinal arithmetic with the axiom of choice can be proved, including . From the case  the existence of a type level ordered pair can be derived:  is equal to  just in case , which would be witnessed by a one-to-one correspondence between Kuratowski pairs  and double singletons : redefine  as the c such that  is associated with the Kuratowski : this is a type-level notion of ordered pair.\n\n The Axiom of Counting and subversion of stratification \n\nSo there are two different implementations of the natural numbers in NFU (though they are the same in ZFC): finite ordinals and finite cardinals. Each of these supports a T operation in NFU (basically the same operation). It is easy to prove that  is a natural number if n is a natural number in NFU + Infinity + Choice (and so  and the first\ninfinite ordinal  are cantorian) but it is not possible to prove in this theory that . However, common sense indicates that this should be true, and so it can be adopted as an axiom:\nRosser's Axiom of Counting: For each natural number n, .\nOne natural consequence of this axiom (and indeed its original formulation) is\n for each natural number n.\nAll that can be proved in NFU without Counting is .\n\nA consequence of Counting is that N is a strongly cantorian set (again, this is an equivalent assertion).\n\nProperties of strongly cantorian sets\nThe type of any variable restricted to a strongly cantorian set A can be raised or lowered as desired by replacing references to  with references to  (type of a raised; this presupposes that it is known that a is a set; otherwise one must say \"the element of \" to get this effect) or  (type of a lowered) where  for all , so it is not necessary to assign types to such variables for purposes of stratification.\n\nAny subset of a strongly cantorian set is strongly cantorian. The power set of a strongly cantorian set is strongly cantorian. The cartesian product of two strongly cantorian sets is strongly cantorian.\n\nIntroducing the Axiom of Counting means that types need not be assigned to variables restricted to N or to P(N), R (the set of reals) or indeed any set ever considered in classical mathematics outside of set theory.\n\nThere are no analogous phenomena in ZFC. See the main New Foundations article for stronger axioms that can be adjoined to NFU to enforce \"standard\" behavior of familiar mathematical objects.\n\n Familiar number systems: positive rationals, magnitudes, and reals \n\nRepresent positive fractions as pairs of positive natural numbers (0 is excluded):  is represented by the pair . To make , introduce the relation  defined by . It is provable that this is an equivalence relation: define positive rational numbers as equivalence classes of pairs of positive natural numbers under this relation. Arithmetic operations on positive rational numbers and the order relation on positive rationals are defined just as in elementary school and proved (with some effort) to have the expected properties.\n\nRepresent magnitudes (positive reals) as nonempty proper initial segments of the positive rationals with no largest element. The operations of addition and multiplication on magnitudes are implemented by elementwise addition of the positive rational elements of the magnitudes. Order is implemented as set inclusion.\n\nRepresent real numbers as differences  of magnitudes: formally speaking, a real number is an equivalence class of pairs  of magnitudes under the equivalence relation  defined by . The operations of addition and multiplication on real numbers are defined just as one would expect from the algebraic rules for adding and multiplying differences. The treatment of order is also as in elementary algebra.\n\nThis is the briefest sketch of the constructions. Note that the constructions are exactly the same in ZFC and in NFU, except for the difference in the constructions of the natural numbers: since all variables are restricted to strongly cantorian sets, there is no need to worry about stratification restrictions. Without the Axiom of Counting, it might be necessary to introduce some applications of T in a full discussion of these constructions.\n\n Operations on indexed families of sets \n\nIn this class of constructions it appears that ZFC has an advantage over NFU: though the constructions are clearly feasible in NFU, they are more complicated than in ZFC for reasons having to do with stratification.\n\nThroughout this section assume a type-level ordered pair. Define  as . The definition of the general n-tuple using the Kuratowski pair is trickier, as one needs to keep the types of all the projections the same, and the type displacement between the n-tuple and its projections increases as n increases. Here, the n-tuple has the same type as each of its projections.\n\nGeneral cartesian products are defined similarly: \n\nThe definitions are the same in ZFC but without any worries about stratification (the grouping given here is opposite to that more usually used, but this is easily corrected for).\n\nNow consider the infinite cartesian product . In ZFC, this is defined as the set of all functions f with domain I such that  (where A is implicitly understood as a function taking each i to ).\n\nIn NFU, this is requires attention to type. Given a set I and set valued function A whose value at  in  is written , Define  as the set of all functions f with domain I such that : notice that  is stratified because of our convention that A is a function with values at singletons of the indices. Note that the very largest families of sets (which cannot be indexed by sets of singletons) will not have cartesian products under this definition. Note further that the sets  are at the same type as the index set I (since one type higher than its elements); the product, as a set of functions with domain I (so at the same type as I) is one type higher (assuming a type-level ordered pair).\n\nNow consider the product  of the cardinals of these sets. The cardinality || is one type higher than the cardinals , so the correct definition of the infinite product of cardinals is  (because the inverse of T is not total, it is possible that this may not exist).\n\nRepeat this for disjoint unions of families of sets and sums of families of cardinals. Again, let A be a set-valued function with domain : write  for . The disjoint union  is the set . This set is at the same type as the sets .\n\nThe correct definition of the sum  is thus , since there is no type displacement.\n\nIt is possible to extend these definitions to handle index sets which are not sets of singletons, but this introduces an additional type level and is not needed for most purposes.\n\nIn ZFC, define the disjoint union  as , where  abbreviates .\n\nPermutation methods can be used to show relative consistency with NFU of the assertion that for every strongly cantorian set A there is a set I of the same size whose elements are self-singletons:  for each i in I.\n\n The cumulative hierarchy \n\nIn ZFC, define the cumulative hierarchy as the ordinal-indexed sequence of sets satisfying the following conditions: ; ;  for limit ordinals . This is an example of a construction by transfinite recursion. The rank of a set A is said to be  if and only if . The existence of the ranks as sets depends on the axiom of replacement at each limit step (the hierarchy cannot be constructed in Zermelo set theory); by the axiom of foundation, every set belongs to some rank.\n\nThe cardinal  is called .\n\nThis construction cannot be carried out in NFU because the power set operation is not a set function in NFU ( is one type higher than A for purposes of stratification).\n\nThe sequence of cardinals  can be implemented in NFU. Recall that  is defined as , where  is a convenient set of size 2, and . Let  be the smallest set of cardinals which contains  (the cardinality of the set of natural numbers), contains the cardinal  whenever it contains , and which is closed under suprema of sets of cardinals.\n\nA convention for ordinal indexing of any well-ordering  is defined as the element x of the field of  such that\nthe order type of the restriction of  to  is ; then define  as the element with index  in the natural order on the elements of . The cardinal  is the element with index  in the natural order on all infinite cardinals (which is a well-ordering, see above). Note that  follows immediately from this definition. In all these constructions, notice that the type of the index  is two higher (with type-level ordered pair) than the type of .\n\nEach set A of ZFC has a transitive closure  (the intersection of all transitive sets which contains A). By the axiom of foundation, the restriction of the membership relation to the transitive closure of A is a well-founded relation. The relation  is either empty or has A as its top element, so this relation is a set picture. It can be proved in ZFC that every set picture is isomorphic to some .\n\nThis suggests that (an initial segment of) the cumulative hierarchy can be studied by considering the isomorphism classes of set pictures. These isomorphism classes are sets and make up a set in NFU. There is a natural set relation analogous to membership on isomorphism classes of set pictures: if  is a set picture, write  for its isomorphism class and define  as holding if  is the isomorphism class of the restriction of y to the downward closure of one of the elements of the preimage under y of the top element of y. The relation E is a set relation, and it is straightforward to prove that it is well-founded and extensional. If the definition of E is confusing, it can be deduced from the observation that it is induced by precisely the relationship which holds between the set picture associated with A and the set picture associated with B when  in the usual set theory.\n\nThere is a T operation on isomorphism classes of set pictures analogous to the T operation on ordinals: if x is a set picture, so is . Define  as . It is easy to see that .\n\nAn axiom of extensionality for this simulated set theory follows from E's extensionality. From its well-foundedness follows an axiom of foundation. There remains the question of what comprehension axiom E may have. Consider any collection of set pictures  (collection of set pictures whose fields are made up entirely of singletons). Since each  is one type higher than x (using a type-level ordered pair), replacing each element  of the field of each  in the collection with  results in a collection of set pictures isomorphic to the original collection but with their fields disjoint. The union of these set\npictures with a new top element yields a set picture whose isomorphism type will have as its preimages under E exactly the elements of the original collection. That is, for any collection of isomorphism types , there is an isomorphism type  whose preimage under E is exactly this collection.\n\nIn particular, there will be an isomorphism type [v] whose preimage under E is the collection of all T[x]'s (including T[v]). Since T[v] E v and E is well-founded, . This resembles the resolution of the Burali–Forti paradox discussed above and in the New Foundations article, and is in fact the local resolution of Mirimanoff's paradox of the set of all well-founded sets.\n\nThere are ranks of isomorphism classes of set pictures just as there are ranks of sets in the usual set theory. For any collection of set pictures A, define S(A) as the set of all isomorphism classes of set pictures whose preimage under E is a subset of A; call A a \"complete\" set if every subset of A is a preimage under E. The collection of \"ranks\" is the smallest collection containing the empty set and closed under the S operation (which is a kind of power set construction) and under unions of its subcollections. It is straightforward to prove (much as in the usual set theory) that the ranks are well-ordered by inclusion, and so the ranks have an index in this well-order: refer to the rank with index  as . It is provable that  for complete ranks . The union of the complete ranks (which will be the first incomplete rank) with the relation E looks like an initial segment of the universe of Zermelo-style set theory (not necessarily like the full universe of ZFC because it may not be large enough). It is provable that if  is the first incomplete rank, then  is a complete rank and thus . So there is a \"rank of the cumulative hierarchy\" with an \"external automorphism\" T moving the rank downward, exactly the condition on a nonstandard model of a rank in the cumulative hierarchy under which a model of NFU is constructed in the New Foundations article. There are technical details to verify, but there is an interpretation not only of a fragment of ZFC but of NFU itself in this structure, with  defined as : this \"relation\"  is not a set relation but has the same type displacement between its arguments as the usual membership relation .\n\nSo there is a natural construction inside NFU of the cumulative hierarchy of sets which internalizes the natural construction of a model of NFU in Zermelo-style set theory.\n\nUnder the Axiom of Cantorian Sets described in the New Foundations article, the strongly cantorian part of the set of isomorphism classes of set pictures with the E relation as membership becomes a (proper class) model of ZFC (in which there are n-Mahlo cardinals for each n; this extension of NFU is strictly stronger than ZFC). This is a proper class model because the strongly cantorian isomorphism classes do not make up a set.\n\nPermutation methods can be used to create from any model of NFU a model in which every strongly cantorian isomorphism type of set pictures is actually realized as the restriction of the true membership relation to the transitive closure of a set.\n\n See also \nAxiomatic set theory\n\nReferences\nKeith Devlin, 1994.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impredicativity",
    "text": "Something that is impredicative, in mathematics, logic and philosophy of mathematics, is a self-referencing definition. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.\n\nThe opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building stratified (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is intuitionistic type theory, which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.\n\nRussell's paradox is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The paradox is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be  asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.\n\nThe greatest lower bound of a set , , also has an impredicative definition:  if and only if for all elements  of ,  is less than or equal to , and any  less than or equal to all elements of  is less than or equal to . This definition quantifies over the set (potentially infinite, depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of , one of which being the glb itself. Hence predicativism would reject this definition.Kleene 1952:42–43\n\n History \n\nThe terms \"predicative\" and \"impredicative\" were introduced by , though the meaning has changed a little since then. \n\nSolomon Feferman provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.Solomon Feferman, \"Predicativity\" (2002)\n\nThe vicious circle principle was suggested by Henri Poincaré (1905-6, 1908)dates derived from Kleene 1952:42 and Bertrand Russell in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called impredicative.\n\nThe first modern paradox appeared with Cesare Burali-Forti's 1897 A question on transfinite numbersvan Heijenoort's commentary before Burali-Forti's (1897) A question on transfinite numbers in van Heijenoort 1967:104; see also his commentary before Georg Cantor's (1899) Letter to Dedekind in van Heijenoort 1967:113 and would become known as the Burali-Forti paradox. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) \"naive\" set theory and this become known as Cantor's paradox. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901Commentary by van Heijenoort before Bertrand Russell's Lettern to Frege in van Heijenoort 1967:124 with his reading of Frege's treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 Begriffsschrift; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:\n\nIn other words, given  the function  is the variable and  is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value  for  itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:\n\nFrege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:\n\nWhile the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that \"The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in The principles of mathematics (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...\".Van Heijenoort's commentary before Bertrand Russell's (1902) Letter to Frege 1967:124 Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by \"propounding his axiom of reducibility. It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a predicative function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments\".Willard V. Quine's commentary before Bertrand Russell's 1908 Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types But this \"axiom\" was met with resistance from all quarters.\n\nThe rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the natural numbers as classically understood) leads to the position in the philosophy of mathematics known as predicativism, advocated by Henri Poincaré and Hermann Weyl in his Das Kontinuum. Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.\n\nErnst Zermelo in his 1908 \"A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering\" presents an entire section \"b. Objection concerning nonpredicative definition\" where he argued against \"Poincaré (1906, p. 307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it excludes all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it\".van Heijenoort 1967:190 He gives two examples of impredicative definitions – (i) the notion of Dedekind chains and (ii) \"in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined \"completed\" set of numbers  is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical\".van Heijenoort 1967:190–191 He ends his section with the following observation: \"A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition definiens and definiendum are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible\".van Heijenoort 1967:191\n\nZermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined \"completed\" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of Least upper bound in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 Das Kontinuum (The Continuum) to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the \"theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set  of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)\".Kleene 1952:43\n\nRamsey argued that \"impredicative\" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of \"tallest person in the room\" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as:  if and only if for all elements  of ,  is less than or equal to , and  is in .\n\nBurgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of Frege's logic, Peano arithmetic, second order arithmetic, and axiomatic set theory.\n\n See also \n Gödel, Escher, Bach\n Impredicative polymorphism\n Logicism\n Richard's paradox\n\n Notes \n\n References \n \n PlanetMath article on predicativism\n John Burgess, 2005.

Weyl in his 1918 (\"Das Kontinuum\") attempted to derive as much of analysis as was possible without the use of impredicative definitions, \"but not the theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set M of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (CF. also Weyl 1919)\" (p. 43).\n Hans Reichenbach 1947, Elements of Symbolic Logic, Dover Publications, Inc., NY, .

    "title": "Incompressibility method",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompressibility_method",
    "text": "In mathematics, the incompressibility method is a proof method like the probabilistic method, the counting method or the pigeonhole principle. To prove that an object in a certain class (on average) satisfies a certain property, select an object of that class which is incompressible. If it does not satisfy the property, it can be compressed by computable coding. Since it can be generally proven that almost all objects in a given class are incompressible, the argument demonstrates that almost all objects in the class have the property involved (not just the average). To select an incompressible object is ineffective, and cannot be done by a computer program. However, a simple counting argument usually shows that almost all objects of a given class can be compressed by only a few bits (are incompressible).\n\nHistory\nThe incompressibity method depends on an objective, fixed notion of incompressibility. Such a notion was provided by the Kolmogorov complexity theory, named for Andrey Kolmogorov. A. N. Kolmogorov, \"Three approaches to the definition of the concept 'quantity of information', Probl. Peredachi Inf., 1:1 (1965), 3–11\n\nOne of the first uses of the incompressibility method with Kolmogorov complexity its theory of computation was toW. J.

Theory, 1979. prove that the running time of a one-tape Turing machine is quadratic for accepting a palindromic language and sorting algorithms require at least  time to sort  items. The first influential paper using the incompressibility method was published in 1980.W. J. Paul, J. I. Seiferas, J. Simon, \"An information-theoretic approach to time bounds for on-line computation\" (preliminary version), Proc. 12th  ACM Symp. Theory Comput (STOC), 357–367, 1980. The method was applied to a number of fields, and its name was coined in a textbook.M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, An Introduction to Kolmogorov Ccomplexity and Its Applications, Springer, 1993, 1997, 2008, Chapter 6.\n\nSummary\nThe Kolmogorov complexity of an object, represented by a finite, binary string, is the length of the shortest binary program on a fixed, optimal universal Turing machine. Since the machine is fixed and the program concerned is the shortest, the Kolmogorov complexity is a definite positive integer. The Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of the shortest binary program from which it can be computed. Therefore, it is a lower bound on the length of a computably-compressed version (in bits) of that object by any existing (or future) compression program.\n\nApplications\n\nNumber theory\nAccording to an elegant Euclidian proof, there is an infinite number of prime numbers. Bernhard Riemann demonstrated that the number of primes less than a given number is connected with the 0s of the Riemann zeta function. Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin proved in 1896 that this\nnumber of primes is asymptotic to ; see Prime number theorem (use  for the natural logarithm an  for the binary logarithm). Using the incompressibility method, G. J. Chaitin argued as follows:  Each  can be described by its prime factorization  (which is unique), where  are the first  primes which are (at most)  and the exponents (possibly) 0. Each exponent is (at most) , and can be described by  bits. The description of  can be given in  bits, provided we know the value of  (enabling one to parse the consecutive blocks of exponents). To describe  requires only  bits. Using the incompressibility of most positive integers, for each  there is a positive integer  of binary length  which cannot be described in fewer than  bits. This shows that the number of primes,   less than , satisfies\n \n\nA more-sophisticated approach attributed to Piotr Berman (present proof partially by John Tromp) describes every incompressible  by  and , where  is the largest prime number dividing . Since  is incompressible, the length of this description must exceed . To parse the first block of the description  must be given in prefix form , where  is an arbitrary, small, positive function. Therefore, . Hence,  with  for a special sequence of values . This shows that the expression below holds for this special sequence, and a simple extension shows that it holds for every :\n\nBoth proofs are presented in more detail.\n\nGraph theory\nA labeled graph  with  nodes can be represented by a string  of  bits, where each bit indicates the presence (or absence) of an edge between the pair of nodes in that position. , and the degree  of each vertex satisfies\n\nTo prove this by the incompressibity method, if the deviation is larger we can compress the description of  below ; this provides the required contradiction. This theorem is required in a more complicated proof, where the incompressibility argument is used a number of times to show that the number of unlabeled graphs is\n\n H. M. Buhrman, M. Li, J. T.

This problem was solved for small arrangements, and much work was done on asymptotic expression as a function of . The original conjecture of Heilbronn was  during the early 1950s. Paul Erdős proved that this bound is correct for , a prime number. The general problem remains unsolved, apart from the best-known lower bound  (achievable; hence, Heilbronn's conjecture is not correct for general ) and upper bound  (proven by Komlos, Pintsz and Szemeredi in 1982 and 1981, respectively). Using the incompressibility method, the average case was studied. It was proven that if the area is too small (or large) it can be compressed below the Kolmogorov complexity of a uniformly-random arrangement (high Kolmogorov complexity). This proves that for the overwhelming majority of the arrangements (and the expectation), the area of the smallest triangle formed by three of  points thrown uniformly at random in the unit square is . In this case, the incompressibility method proves the lower and upper bounds of the property involved. T. Jiang, M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, \"The average‐case area of Heilbronn‐type triangles\", Random Structures & Algorithms, 20:2(2002),  206–219.\n\nProbability\nThe law of the iterated logarithm, the law of large numbers and the recurrence property were shown to hold using the incompressibility methodV. G. Vovk, \"The law of the iterated logarithm for random Kolmogorov, or chaotic, sequences\", Theory Probab. Appl. 3:32(1988), 413–426. and Kolmogorov's zero–one law,M. Zimand, \"A high-low Kolmogorov complexity law equivalent to the 0–1 law\", Inform. Process. Letters, 57:2(1996), 59–84. with normal numbers expressed as binary strings (in the sense of E. Borel) and the distribution of 0s and 1s in binary strings of high Kolmogorov complexity.M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, \"Statistical properties of finite sequences with high Kolmogorov complexity\",  Mathematical Systems Theory, 27(1994), 365–376.\n\nTuring-machine time complexity\nThe basic Turing machine, as conceived by Alan Turing in 1936, consists of a memory: a tape of potentially-infinite cells on which a symbol can be written and a finite control, with a read-write head attached, which scans a cell on the tape. At each step, the read-write head can change the symbol in the cell being scanned and move one cell left, right, or not at all according to instruction from the finite control. Turing machines with two tape symbols may be considered for convenience, but this is not essential.\n\nIn 1968, F. C. Hennie showed that such a Turing machine requires order  to recognize the language of binary palindromes in the worst case. In 1977, W. J. Paul presented an incompressibility proof which showed that order  time is required in the average case. For every integer , consider all words of that length. For convenience, consider words with the middle third of the word consisting of 0s. The accepting Turing machine ends with an accept state on the left (the beginning of the tape). A Turing-machine computation of a given word gives for each location (the boundary between adjacent cells) a sequence of crossings from left to right and right to left, each crossing in a particular state of the finite control. Positions in the middle third of a candidate word all have a crossing sequence of length  (with a total computation time of ), or some position has a crossing sequence of . In the latter case, the word (if it is a palindrome) can be identified by that crossing sequence.\n\nIf other palindromes (ending in an accepting state on the left) have the same crossing sequence, the word (consisting of a prefix up to the position of the involved crossing sequence) of the original palindome concatenated with a suffix the remaining length of the other palindrome would be accepted as well. Taking the palindrome of , the Kolmogorov complexity described by  bits is a contradiction.\n\nSince the overwhelming majority of binary palindromes have a high Kolmogorov complexity, this gives a lower bound on the average-case running time. The result is much more difficult, and shows that Turing machines with  work tapes are more powerful than those with  work tapes in real time (here one symbol per step).\n\nIn 1984, W. MaassW. Maass, \"Combinatorial lower bound arguments for deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines\", Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 292 (1985), 675–693. and M. Li and  P. M. B. Vitanyi M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, \"Tape versus queue and stacks: The lower bounds\", Information and Computation, 78:1(1988), 56–85. showed that the simulation of two work tapes by one work tape of a Turing machine takes  time deterministically (optimally, solving a 30-year open problem) and  time nondeterministically  (in, this is . More results concerning tapes, stacks and queues, deterministically and nondeterministically, were proven with the incompressibiity method.\n\nTheory of computation\nHeapsort is a sorting method, invented by J. W. J. Williams and refined by R. W. Floyd, which always runs in  time. It is questionable whether Floyd's method is better than Williams' on average, although it is better in the worst case. Using the incompressibility method, it was shown that Williams' method runs on average in  time and Floyd's method runs on average in  time. The proof was suggested by Ian Munro.\n\nShellsort, discovered by Donald Shell in 1959, is a comparison sort which divides a list to be sorted into sublists and sorts them separately. The sorted sublists are then merged, reconstituting a partially-sorted list. This process repeats a number of times (the number of passes). The difficulty of analyzing the complexity of the sorting process is that it depends on the number  of keys to be sorted, on the number  of passes and the increments governing the scattering in each pass; the sublist is the list of keys which are the increment parameter apart. Although this sorting method inspired a large number of papers, only the worst case was established. For the average running time, only the best case for a two-pass ShellsortD. E. Knuth, Sorting and Searching (Vol. 3 The Art of Computer Programming), 2nd Ed. Addison-Wesley, 1998, pp 83–95. and an upper bound of  S. Janson, D. E. Knuth, \"Shellsort with three increments\", Random Structures Algorithms 10:1–2(1997), 125–142. for a particular increment sequence for three-pass Shellsort were established. A general lower bound on an average -pass Shellsort was given T. Jiang, M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, \"A lower bound on the average-case complexity of Shellsort\", Journal of the ACM (JACM), 47:5(2000) 905–911. which was the first advance in this problem in four decades. In every pass, the comparison sort moves a key to another place a certain distance (a path length). All these path lengths are logarithmically coded for length in the correct order (of passes and keys). This allows the reconstruction of the unsorted list from the sorted list. If the unsorted list is incompressible (or nearly so), since the sorted list has near-zero Kolmogorov complexity (and the path lengths together give a certain code length) the sum must be at least as large as the Kolmogorov complexity of the original list. The sum of the path lengths corresponds to the running time, and the running time is lower-bounded in this argument by . This was improved in P.M.B. Vitanyi (2018), On the average-case complexity of Shellsort, Random Structures and Algorithms, 52:2, 354--363 to a lower bound of \n\nwhere . This implies for example the Jiang-Li-Vitanyi lower bound for all -pass increment sequences and improves that lower bound for particular increment sequences;\nthe Janson-Knuth upper bound is matched by a lower bound for the used increment sequence, showing that three pass Shellsort for this increment sequence uses  inversions.\n\nAnother example is as follows.  are natural numbers and , it was shown that for every  there is a Boolean  matrix; every  submatrix has a rank at least  by the incompressibility method.\n\nLogic\nAccording to Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, in every formal system with computably enumerable theorems (or proofs) strong enough to contain Peano arithmetic, there are true (but unprovable) statements or theorems. This is proved by the incompressibility method; every formal system  can be described finitely (for example, in  bits). In such a formal system, we can express  since it contains arithmetic. Given , we can search exhaustively for a proof that some string  of length  satisfies . In this way, we obtain the first such string; : contradiction.G. J. Chaitin, Algorithmic Information Theory, Cambridge University Press, 1977.\n\nComparison with other methods\nAlthough the probabilistic method generally shows the existence of an object with a certain property in a class, the incompressibility method tends to show that the overwhelming majority of objects in the class (the average, or the expectation) have that property. It is sometimes easy to turn a probabilistic proof into an incompressibility proof or vice versa. In some cases, it is difficult or impossible to turn a proof by incompressibility into a probabilistic (or counting proof). In virtually all the cases of Turing-machine time complexity cited above, the incompressibility method solved problems which had been open for decades; no other proofs are known. Sometimes a proof by incompressibility can be turned into a proof by counting, as happened in the case of the general lower bound on the running time of Shellsort.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Mathematical principles\nCategory:Computability theory\nCategory:Information theory"

    "text": "The language Interlingue, known as Occidental until 1949, is a planned international auxiliary language created by Edgar de Wahl, a Balto-German naval officer and teacher from Tallinn, Estonia, and published in 1922. The vocabulary is based on already existing words from various languages and a system of derivation using recognized prefixes and suffixes. The language is thereby naturalistic, at the same time as it is constructed to be regular.Curs de Occidental in Occidental, read 18 November 2013. Occidental was quite popular in the years up to, during, and shortly after the Second World War, but declined thereafter.\nthumb|left|Edgar de Wahl (far right) in 1927.\nOccidental is devised so that many of its derived word forms reflect the forms common to a number of Western European languages, primarily those in the Romance family,Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 90: Translation: \"Occidental being a neo-Latin language, the influence of the languages French, Italian and Spanish will probably still be greater than that of the Anglo-Saxons.\"Cosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 104: Translation: \"and what else is Occidental than a simplified Italian, or, to state it more generally, the simplified commonality of all Romance languages?\"Cosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 116: Translation: \"Latin is dead, even though it is still used for a few limited purposes. But the mother language Latin still lives in her daughters, the Romance languages - and Occidental is one of them.\" along with a certain amount of Germanic vocabulary. Many words were formed through application of de Wahl's rule, a set of rules for regular conversion of verb infinitives into derived words including from double-stem verbs of Latin origin (e.g. vider to see and its derivative vision). The result is a language easy to understand at first sight for individuals acquainted with several Western European languages. This readability and simplified grammar along with the regular appearance of the magazine Cosmoglotta made Occidental popular in Europe during the 15 years before World War II.Cosmoglotta B, 1935, p. 2\n\nIn The Esperanto Book, Don Harlow says that Occidental had an intentional emphasis on European forms, and that some of its leading followers espoused a Eurocentric philosophy,Harlow, Don. The Esperanto Book, Chapter 3: \"How to Build a Language\" . which may have hindered its spread. Still, Occidental gained adherents in many nations including Asian nations.\n\nOccidental survived World War II, undergoing a name change to Interlingue, but faded into insignificance following the appearance in 1951 of a competing naturalistic project, Interlingua, which attracted among others the notable Occidentalist Ric Berger. The emergence of Interlingua occurred around the same time that Edgar de Wahl, who had opted to remain in Tallinn, was sent to a sanitarium by Soviet authorities and was not permitted to correspond with Occidentalists in Western Europe. His death was confirmed in 1948.Cosmoglotta A, October 1948 The proposal to change the name from Occidental to Interlingue was twofold: to attempt to demonstrate to the Soviet Union the neutrality of the language, and in hopes of a union with Interlingua.\n\nHistory and activity\nalt=|thumb|The first issue of Kosmoglott (later Cosmoglotta), published in haste after the announcement that the League of Nations was studying the problem of an international language.\n\n Beginnings \nThe activities of Occidental and its users can be seen through the magazine Cosmoglotta, which began publication in 1922 in Tallinn, Estonia under the name Kosmoglott. The language announced that year was a product of years of personal experimentation by de Wahl under the name Auli (auxiliary language), which he used during the period from 1906 to 1921 and later on gained the nickname proto-Occidental. During the development of the language de Wahl explained his approach in a letter to an acquaintance the Baron d'Orczy written in Auli: \"My direction in the creation of a universal language seems quite regressive to you...I understand that quite well, because I am starting it right from the other end. I do not begin with the alphabet and the grammar and then have to adopt the vocabulary to it, but just the other way around: I take all international material of words, suffixes, endings, grammatical forms etc., and then I work to organize that material, put it in order, compile, interpolate, extrapolate and sift through it.\" During the development of Occidental through Auli, de Wahl corresponded frequently with the Italian mathematician and creator of Latino sine flexione Giuseppe Peano and gained an appreciation for the international vocabulary in that language, writing that \"I believe the \"Vocabulario commune\" book by Professor Peano to already be a more valuable and scientific work than the entire scholastic litterature of Ido on imaginary things evoked by the \"fundamento\" of Zamenhof.\"\nthumb|right|Participants at an Occidental gathering in Vienna, 1928: Engelbert Pigal, Karl Janotta, A. Deminger, Hanns Hörbiger, Eugen Moess, Franz Houdek, Johann Robert HörbigerOccidental was announced in 1922 at a stage of near but not total completion. De Wahl did not originally intend to announce the language for another few years but did so then through the publication of Kosmoglott and the name Occidental for the language after hearing that the League of Nations had begun an inquiry into the question of an international auxiliary language. It began gathering followers despite a complete lack of grammars and dictionaries due to its readability. Two years later de Wahl wrote that he was in correspondence with some 30 people \"in good Occidental\" despite the lack of learning material. The first dictionary was published the next year in 1925, the radicarium directiv which was a collection of Occidental root words and their equivalents in 8 languages.\n\nFor a number of years Kosmoglott was a forum for various other planned languages, while still mainly written in Occidental. Until 1924 the magazine was also affiliated with the Academia pro Interlingua,http://cosmoglotta.blogspot.com/2010/12/jan-feb-1924.html which promoted Peano's Latino sine flexione. In 1927 the name was changed to Cosmoglotta as it began to promote Occidental in lieu of other languages,http://cosmoglotta.blogspot.com/2010/12/nr-38-january-february-1927.html and in January of the same year the magazine's editorial and administrative office was moved to Vienna, Austria in the region of Mauer, now part of Liesing. Much of the early success for Occidental in this period came from the office's new central location, along with the efforts of Engelbert Pigal, also from Austria, whose article Li Ovre de Edgar de Wahl (the Work of Edgar de Wahl) led to interest in Occidental from users of the Ianguage Ido. \n\n The Vienna period, World War II and language standardization \nthumb|right|upright=2.5|PR postcard with Occidental text created in 1928 in Vienna\nBesides the new location in a city much closer to the centre of Europe, the Vienna period was also marked by financial stability for the first time due to the support from a number of backers, particularly Hans Hörbiger, also from Vienna, and G.A. Moore from London, from which \"Cosmoglotta was able to live without difficulty and gained a circle of readers despite the economic crisis\". This did not last long as Hörbiger and Moore died at \"nearly the same time\" in 1931, and Cosmoglotta was again forced to rely on revenue from subscriptions, publications and the like.\n\nThe growing Occidental movement began a more assertive campaign for the language in the early 1930s, leveraging its at-sight readability by contacting organizations such as embassies, printing houses and the League of Nations using letters in Occidental that were often understood and responded to (in the organization's own working language), usually including the phrasing below: Scrit in lingue international \"Occidental\" (\"Written in the international language Occidental\"). A large number of numbered \"documents\" were produced at this time as well to introduce the concept of an international language and advocate Occidental as the answer to Europe's \"tower of Babel\". Recordings of spoken Occidental on phonograph (gramophone) records for distribution also began to be made in this period.\n\nThe years from 1935 to 1939 were particularly active for Cosmoglotta, during which a second edition was produced along with the original Cosmoglotta: Cosmoglotta B (originally called Cosmoglotta-Informationes) which focused on more linguistic issues, reports of Occidental in the news, financial updates and other items of internal interest. In early 1936, not counting the 110 issues of Cosmoglotta and any other journals and bulletins, a total of 80 publications existed in and about Occidental. At the same time, the years leading up to the Second World War led to difficulties for Occidental along with other planned languages which were made illegal in Germany along with AustriaCosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 12. Translation öf the last pre-war Occidental postcard from Austria sent to Switzerland in December 1938: \"My sadness from not being able to continue my interlinguistic work continues and has made me almost melancholic. Please do not send me mail in Occidental.\" and Czechoslovakia, forced to disband,Cosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 109. Translation: \"The reality is that Occidental, like the other international languages, is prohibited in Germany, that the Occidental societies have been disbanded there (also in Czechoslovakia and Austria) even before the war, and that only regime change in those countries will make Occidental propagation a possibility again. kept under Gestapo surveillance, and had their didactic materials destroyed. The interdiction of auxiliary languages in Germany was particularly damaging as this was where most Occidentalists lived at the time. The inability to accept payment for subscriptions was a financial blow as well, a difficulty that continued after the war when Germany was divided into zones of influence and payments were still not permitted. No communication took place between Edgar de Wahl in Tallinn and the Occidental Union in Switzerland from 1939 to October 1947, first due to the war itself and thereafter from intercepted mail between Switzerland and the Soviet Union, which bewildered de Wahl who had sent multiple letters and even a large collection of translated poetry into Occidental which were never delivered. In 1940 no issues of either Cosmoglotta were produced, but in 1941 Cosmoglotta B began publication once again and continued until 1950. An edition of either Cosmoglotta A or B was published every month between January 1937 and September 1939, and then (after the initial shock of the war) every month from September 1941 to June 1951. The opting for Cosmoglotta B during this period was due to only those in neutral Switzerland and Sweden being able to fully devote themselves to the language, who carried on activities in a semi-official form using it.\n\nOne of these activities was language standardization. De Wahl had created Occidental with a number of unchangeable features, but believed that others that had more than one permissible form could not be resolved by decree alone and left the ultimate decision to the community by including both possible forms in the first Occidental dictionaries.Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 3: Translation: \"For some hundreds of international words there are two forms between which it is not easy to know which one is better. E. de Wahl wisely wrote both in the first dictionaries, with the intention to let practice make the decision.\" One example concerned the verb scrir (to write) and a possible other form scripter. De Wahl expressed a preference for scrir, finding scripter to be somewhat heavy, but commented that scripter was certainly permissible, and also surmised that Occidental might take on a similar evolution to natural languages where both forms come into common use, the longer and more Latin-like form having a heavier and more formal character and the shorter a lighter and more everyday tone (cf. English story vs. history).\n\nThe decision over etymologic vs. recognizable spellings in words such as attractive (adtractiv, attractiv or atractiv) and oppression (obpression vs. oppression vs. opression) is oneCosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 66  example where community usage quickly led to a rejection of the first option and eventually settled on the third. Much of Occidental's vocabulary was solved in this way (e.g. both ac and anc were proposed for the word \"also\" but ac was hardly if ever used), but not all. With questions still remaining about the official form of some words and a lack of general material destined for the general public, during World War II much time was spent on standardization of the language and course creation, and in August 1943 the decision was made, given the length of the war, to create an interim academy to guide this process.Cosmoglotta B, 1943, p. 85: English translation: \"Because the president and secretary of the Academy are located in countries in a state of war, the leading Occidentalists of the neutral countries, Switzerland and Sweden, believe it necessary to set up an INTERIM ACADEMY which will function until the other will be able to resume its work. The decisions of this interim academy will be conditional, i.e.: must be validated by the regular Academy after the war, and due to that it will deliver to it all documents justifying its decisions, with detailed reasons.\" The standardization process had just about begun not long before the war, and the Swiss Occidentalists, finding themselves isolated from the rest of the continent, opted to concentrate on didactic materials to have prepared by the time the war reached its end. They found themselves confronted with the decision between two forms that had remained in popular usage, but which could be confusing to a new learner of the language.Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 49 During this time, the academy maintained that standardization efforts were based on actual usage, stating that \"...the standardization of the language has natural limits. \"Standardizing\" the language does not mean arbitrarily officializing one of the possible solutions and rejecting the others as indesirable and irritating. One only standardizes solutions that have already been sanctioned through practice.\"Cosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 67: \"...li standardisation del lingue have su natural límites. \"Standardisar li lingue ne significa arbitrarimen oficialisar un del solutiones possibil e rejecter li altris quam índesirabil e genant. On standardisa solmen solutiones queles ja ha esset sanctionat per li practica.\"\n\nDuring the war, Occidentalists noticed that the language was frequently permitted to be sent by telegram within and outside of Switzerland (especially to and from Sweden) even without official recognition, surmising that censors were able to read itCosmoglotta B, 1943, p. 6 and may have thought them to be written in Spanish or Romansch,Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 15 a minor yet official language in Switzerland that at the time lacked a standardized orthography. This allowed a certain amount of communication to take place between the Occidentalists in Switzerland and Sweden. The other centres of Occidental activity in Europe did not fare as well, with the stocks of study materials in Vienna and Tallinn having been destroyed in bombings and numerous Occidentalists sent to concentration camps in Germany and Czechoslovakia. Contacts were reestablished shortly after the war by those who had survived it, particularly from those in France, Czechoslovakia, and Great Britain. A few months before the end of World War II in Europe Cosmoglotta had subscribers in 58 cities in Switzerland.Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 24 Cosmoglotta A began publication again in 1946.\n\n The IALA, Interlingua, and name change to Interlingue \nThe International Auxiliary Language Association, founded in 1924 to study and determine the best planned language for international communication, was at first viewed with suspicion by the Occidental community. The co-founder of the IALA Alice Vanderbilt Morris was an Esperantist, as were many of its staff members, and many Occidentalists including Edgar de Wahl himself believed that it had been set up to eventually recommend Esperanto over other planned languages under a neutral and scientific pretext using its staff of professional linguists to bolster a final recommendation. Relations soon improved, however, as it became clear that the IALA intended to be as impartial as possible by familiarizing itself with all existing planned languages. Ric Berger detailed one visit he made in 1935 to Morris (whose husband was the US ambassador in Brussels) that vastly improved his opinion of the organization: My personal opinion was not so pessimistic, for, finding myself in Brussels in 1935, I sought out Mrs. Morris and soon obtained an audience with her where my charming host invited me to speak in Occidental. She asked her husband, the American ambassador, to come hear me to confirm what seemed to very much interest them: a language in which all words can be understood without having learned it! ... Mrs. Morris could have used her fortune to simply support Esperanto, which was her right as a convicted Esperantist. But instead of that she...decided to donate her money to a *neutral* linguistic tribunal to solve the problem *scientifically*, even if the judgement goes against her convictions.As a result, opinions of the IALA and its activities in the Occidental community began to improve and reports on its activities in Cosmoglotta became increasingly positive. After 1945 when the IALA announced it planned to create its own language and showed four possible versions under consideration, Occidentalists were by and large pleased that the IALA had decided to create a language so similar in appearance to Occidental, seeing it as a credible association that gave weight to their argument that an auxiliary language should proceed from study of natural languages instead of attempting to fit them into an artificial system. Ric Berger was particularly positive about the IALA's new language, calling it in 1948 \"almost the same language\", though not without reservations, doubting whether a project with such a similar outward appearance would be able to \"suddenly cause prejudices [against planned languages] to fall and create unity among the partisans of international languages\" and fearing that it might simply \"disperse the partisans of the natural language with nothing to show for it\" after Occidental had created \"unity in the naturalistic school\" for so long.\n\nWhile the two languages had a 90% identical vocabulary when word endings and orthographic differences were not taken into account (e.g. filosofie and philosophia would be considered the same word), structurally and derivationally they were very different. Occidental with De Wahl's Rule had either done away with Latin double stem verbs (verbs such as act: ager, act- or send: mitter, miss-) or found a way to work around them, while Interlingua simply accepted them as part and parcel of a naturalistic system. The control languages (English, French, Italian, Spanish-Portuguese) used by Interlingua to form its vocabulary also conflicted with Occidental's Germanic and other words which would be by definition ineligible in a combined language that retained Interlingua's methodology. Occidental words such as mann, strax, old, sestra, clocca, svimmar, trincar, etc. could only be incorporated into Interlingua if it did away with the control languages, the languages on which Interlingua itself was based. Interlingua also allowed optional verbal conjugations (such as so, son and sia as the first-person singular, third-person plural and subjunctive form of esser, the verb 'to be') that Occidental had never even considered and viewed as incompatible with an easy international auxiliary language.\n\nMeanwhile, Cosmoglotta was showing financial strain with inflated printing costs after the end of World War II and the inability to collect payments from certain countries, a marked contrast to the well-funded IALA which had been based in New York since the outbreak of the war.  \n\nThe beginning of the Cold War in 1947 created a particularly uncomfortable situation for the Occidental-Union, which now possessed a name that by chance coincided with that of an anti-Russian political league, and which the Occidentalists in Switzerland believed to be the reason for the interception of all of de Wahl's letters sent from Tallinn. In early 1948 the Czechoslovak Occidentalists had begun requesting approval for a new name that would allow them to continue their linguistic activities without suspicion, proposing the name Interal (International auxiliari lingue), to which the union responded that the term Interlingue would be more appropriate and that they were free to introduce the language as Interlingue (Occidental), or even remove the mention of Occidental in parentheses if they felt it necessary. The official vote on the name change to Interlingue took place at the plenum of the Occidental Union in 1949 and was passed with 91% support, making the official name Interlingue, with Interlingue (Occidental) also permitted, valid as of the 1st of September 1949.\n\nThe year 1951 when Interlingua was announced was consequential in weakening Interlingue-Occidental, which until then had been unchallenged in the field of naturalistic planned auxiliary languages. Vĕra Barandovská-Frank's perception of the situation at the time was as follows (translated from Esperanto): \"In the field of naturalistic planned languages Occidental-Interlingue was until then unchallenged (especially after the death of Otto Jespersen, author of Novial), as all new projects were nearly imitations of it. This applied to Interlingua as well, but it carried with it a dictionary of 27 000 words put together by professional linguists that brought great respect, despite in principle only confirming the path that De Wahl had started. The Senate of the Interlingue-Union and the Interlingue-Academie took up the proposals that (1) the Interlingue-Union become a collective member of the IALA and (2) the Interlingue-Union remain favourable to the future activity of the IALA and morally support it. The first proposition was not accepted, but the second was, giving a practical collaboration and support to Interlingua.\n\nAndré Martinet, the second-last director of the IALA, made similar observations to those of Matejka. He confessed that his preferred variant of Interlingua was the one closer to Interlingue than the one officialized by Gode. In these circumstances the efforts by Ric Berger to move all users of Interlingue en masse to Interlingua de IALA was a shock. His heresy caused doubt and interruptions in Interlingue circles, especially after he became involved in the publication of \"Revista de Interlingua\". The former idea of a natural fusion of both languages was shown to be unrealistic, with the new language becoming a rival.\"\n\n Stagnation and revival \nWhile the migration of so many users to Interlingua had severely weakened the Interlingue movement, the remaining users of the language kept the language alive for a time. Besides Cosmoglotta, now publishing once every second month from 1952 and then once per quarter from 1963, bulletins in Interlingue continued to appear such as Interlingue-Postillon (1958, Germany), Novas de Oriente (1958, Japan), Amicitie european (1959, Switzerland), Teorie e practica (Switzerland-Czechoslovakia, 1967), and Novas in Interlingue (Czechoslovakia, 1971). Interlingue activity reached a low during the 1980s and early 1990s, when Cosmoglotta publication ceased for a number of years. According to Esperantist Don Harlow, \"in 1985 Occidental's last periodical, Cosmoglotta, ceased publication, and its editor, Mr. Adrian Pilgrim, is quoted as having described Occidental as a \"dead language.\"\" A decade later, a documentary in 1994 by Steve Hawley and Steyger on planned languages introduced Interlingue speaker Donald Gasper as \"one of the last remaining speakers of the language Occidental\" (a description perhaps better suited for former Occidental-Union president Alphonse Matejka who would not pass away until 1999, as Donald Gasper was a new learner of the language).  \n\nIn the year 1999 the first Yahoo! Group in Occidental was founded, and Cosmoglotta had been publishing intermittently again. An Interlingue Wikipedia was approved in 2004. In recent years official meetings between Interlingue speakers have begun taking place again: a meeting in Ulm on 10 January 2013, another in Munich in 2014 with three participants, and a third in Ulm on 16 August 2015 with five.  \n\nThe most recent edition of the magazine Cosmoglotta is volume 323, published at the end of 2017.  \n\n Language philosophy \nthumb|Sticker from 1930 created to emphasize readability at first sight: Li lingue quel vu comprende (The language you understand) Occidental propaga se self (Occidental promotes itself)\nOne of the earliest users of the language Esperanto, Edgar de Wahl encountered it for the first time in 1888 and remained a fervent supporter of the language for a number of years where he collaborated with Zamenhof on the design of the language and translated one of the first works into Esperanto: \"Princidino Mary\", published in 1889 originally under the name Princino Mary. He remained an Esperantist until 1894 when the vote to reform Esperanto failed, a vote in which de Wahl was one just two that voted neither or Esperanto unchanged, nor for the reform proposed by Zamenhof, but for a completely new reform. Occidental would not be announced for a full 28 years after de Wahl had abandoned Esperanto, a period in which he spent working with other language creators (such as Rosenberger's Idiom Neutral) and trying to develop a system that combined both naturality and regularity. De Wahl's method for doing so was twofold: through de Wahl's Rule to reduce the number of irregularities in verbal derivation to a minimum, and a large number of affixes to do the same with word roots in addition to giving the resulting forms a natural appearance. The large number of suffixes can be seen through a glimpse of just those used to form nouns referring to a type of person: -er- (molinero - miller), -or- (redactor - editor), -ari- (millionario - millionaire), -on- (spion, spy), -ard (mentard, liar), -astr- (poetastro, lousy poet), -es (franceso, Frenchman), -essa (reyessa, queen). In de Wahl's opinion it was always preferable to opt for a productive suffix than to be forced to coin new words from completely new radicals later on. \n\nDe Wahl published in 1922 a modification of Otto Jespersen's principle that \"the best language is that which is easiest for the greatest number of people\", stating that the international language should be easiest for the majority of those who need it (lit. who must apply it), or in other words those that need it in international relations. Along with this came a need for an international language to recognize already international vocabulary regardless of the number of people using it, particularly in specialized areas where for example the term Oenethera biennis (a type of plant) should be implemented and not modified beyond recognition even if the entire world population of botanists, those most often knowing and using the word, did not exceed 10,000. This also implied that words belonging to particular cultures should be imported without modifications, which De Wahl believed brought new ideas of value to European culture that had become \"sick\" after the First World War. He cited the terms karma, ko-tau (kowtow), geisha, and mahdí in 1924 as examples of those that should not be put in a \"vocalic corset\" through obligatory endings (e.g. karmo, koŭtoŭo, gejŝo, madho in Esperanto) when imported into the international language: \"Such words, still not large in number, have seen a large increase in the past century, and in the future will grow in exorbitant proportion when, through international communication, the ideas of stable Oriental cultures will inundate and influence the sick Europe, which is now losing its equilibrium. And the more mutilated the words are, the more mutilated will be the ideas that they represent.\" In an article on the future development of language, de Wahl wrote in 1927 that due to European dominance in the sciences and other areas Occidental required a form and derivation recognizable to Europeans, but that it should also be fitted with a grammatical structure capable of taking on more analytical, non-derived forms in the future (such as the equivalents of \"bake man\" for baker or \"wise way\" for wisdom) if worldwide linguistic trends began to show a preference for them.\n\nOn the subject of schematic regularity versus naturalism in an international language, De Wahl believed that there was a fine balance to be maintained between the two, where too much of the former may be convenient for the early learner but abhorrent for a speaker, and vice versa in the latter case: \"Exceptions are not made to make study more difficult for foreigners, but to make speaking shorter and more fluid....It is clear that in this language as the most impersonal, abstract and businesslike one of all, regularity will be greater and more expanded than in all other national and tribal languages and idioms. But it will never be able to attain a total schematism...Also here the real solution will be a harmonization of the two contrary principles. It requires the sensitive penetration of the real necessity in the instinct of the international superpopulation.\"\n\nWhile primarily Romanic in vocabulary, de Wahl opted for a large Germanic substrate which he felt more expressive for technical and material vocabulary (self, ost for east, svimmar for to swim, moss, etc.) , with Romanic and Greek vocabulary more appropriate in the derivation of international words (femina for woman to form feminin, can for dog to form canin, etc.) as well as mental, corporal and natural conceptions.\n\nUsing internationally-recognized prefixes and suffixes did not imply wholesale importing of international words. Just before the beginning of the Second World War de Wahl called criticisms of Occidental as a chaotic unfounded, stating that English and French users in particular had a tendency to see Occidental as a mix of the two: \"(Occidental's chaotic appearance) is not the fault of Occidental itself, but rather that of its users and especially the French and English, or those that think that the international language should be a mixture of those two languages...that is a fundamental error, especially if these forms present exceptions and irregularities in Occidental's system.\"Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 38 Alphonse Matejka wrote in Cosmoglotta that de Wahl \"always claimed a minimum of autonomy for his language and bitterly fought against all propositions that intended to augment the naturality of the language only by blindly imitating the Romance languages, or as de Wahl said crudely in one of his letters to me, \"by aping French or English\"\".\n\nOccidental's erring on the side of regularity led to vocabulary that was still recognizable but different from the international norm, such as ínpossibil in place of impossibil (ín + poss + ibil), scientic (scientific, from scient-ie + -ic), and descrition (description, from descri-r + -tion). This is one of the greatest differences between it and Interlingua, which has a vocabulary taken from so-called 'prototypes' (the most recent common ancestor to its source languages) while Interlingue/Occidental focused on active, on the fly derivation. After the standardization of Occidental in 1947 and the name change to Interlingue in 1949 there was a push towards greater and greater naturalistic formsCosmoglotta April 1950, p. 5 inspired by the IALA's soon-to-be-published Interlingua, particularly by Ric Berger who advocated replacing the optional -i adjectival ending with -e. After advocating for the change in April 1949 he began implementing it the following month in his own writing and most of the content in Cosmoglotta, in addition to other changes such as nostre (our) and vostre (your) instead of nor and vor. The following April he defended the changes, denying that they were a \"concession to the IALA\" but instead a simple \"concession to the general tendency towards greater naturality found today in the interlinguistic movement\", calling critics of the changes victims of \"long-lasting habits\" and an \"optical illusion\". Whether these experimental changes would have taken root is not known, as Berger left his position as editor of Cosmoglotta soon afterCosmoglotta October 1950, p. 1 and eventually joined Interlingua, while Cosmoglotta returned to publishing in the 1947 standard that continues to this day.\n\n Symbol \nThe symbol of Occidental was chosen in 1936 after some deliberation and many other proposed symbols, including stylized letters, a star as in Esperanto and Ido, a setting sun to represent the sun in the west (the Occident), a globe, and more. The tilde, already used by the Occidental-Union, was eventually selected based on five criteria: symbolic character, simplicity, originality, inconfusability, and for being bichromatic (having two colours) as opposed to polychromatic. Beyond the five criteria, the Occidentalists at the time referenced the lack of a fixed meaning for the tilde in the public sphere, and its similarity to a waveform, implying speech.\n\nAlphabet and pronunciation\nOccidental is written with 26 Latin letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. The letters of the alphabet are pronounced as a, be, ce, de, e, ef, ge, ha, i, jot, ka, el, em, en, o, pe, qu, er, es, te, u, ve, duplic ve, ix, ypsilon, and zet.Grammatica de Interlingue in English, F. Haas 1956. Read 31 October 2013.\n\nPronunciation\nThe vowels a, e, i, o, and u have a continental pronunciation and are all sounded. The y (initial and medial) are pronounced as in \"yes\", ey (final) as in \"they\", and eu as éh-oo.The Basis of International language. Read 1 November 2013.\n\nThe consonants are pronounced as in English, with the following exceptions:\nc when before e and i = [ts]: cive, helice\ng when before e and i = [ʒ], French j, or English s in pleasure: plage, giraffe; but elsewhere c and g are hard as in can, go\nss = [s] as in pass\ns between vowels = [z]: rose, positiv\nz = [dz]\nzz = [ts]\nch = [ʃ], English sh: chambre\nj = [ʒ], French j, or English s in pleasure\nt as [t], except when followed by ia, io, iu, or ie and not preceded by an s. Thus the t in nation is pronounced [ts] but in bastion as [t].\n\nOther doubled consonants are pronounced as a single consonant, unless when separated they would be pronounced differently. Ex. grammatica is pronounced as if written gramatica, but occidental and suggestion are pronounced as if written as oc followed by cidental, and sug followed by gestion.\n\nStress\n\nWords are generally stressed on the vowel before the final consonant: intercalar, parol, forme. Pluralizing a noun does not change the stress: paroles, formes. The endings -bil, -ic, -im, -ul and -um do not change the stress (even when more than one is present in a single word), nor does the adverbial ending -men: rapidmen, duplic, bonissim, singul, possibil, maximum, statisticas. Two vowels together are diphthongized and do not count as two syllables for the purpose of stress: familie, potentie, unless the word is a single consonant or consonant cluster followed by two vowels: die, deo. Compound words are stressed based on the last word in the compound: hodie, substrae. In cases where the accent is irregular, it is indicated by an accent: café, ínpossibil, numeró, númere, felicitá.\n\nThe accent mark is also sometimes used to stress a word (In un casu li naves proveni de ún state = In the case that the ships originate from one country), or over the particles ú when used as a conjunction, ó when used to mean 'either' (ó A, ó B), and é when used to mean 'both' (é A, é B). e.g. Yo ne save u il es (I don't know where he is), Yo vole trincar e lacte e bir (I want to drink both milk and beer) and O il ne save li loc, o il ne vole venir (Either he doesn't know the location or he doesn't want to come) will sometimes be seen written as Yo ne save ú il es, Yo vole trincar é lacte é bir, and Ó il ne save li loc, ó il ne vole venir.\n\nGrammar\nLike English, Interlingue has a definite article and an indefinite article. The definite article (the) is li, and the indefinite (a, an) is un. Plural of a noun is made by adding -s after a vowel, or -es after most consonants. To avoid pronunciation and stress changes, words ending in -c, -g, and -m only add an -s: un libre, du libres, un angul, tri angules, li tric, li trics, li plug, li plugs, li album, pluri albums, li tram, du trams.\n\nPersonal pronouns\nInterlingue has two forms for the personal pronouns: one for the subject form (nominative), and one for the object form (accusative or dative). In short, the personal pronouns in the subject form are:\n\n Singular Plural first second third first second third English I you he she it we you they Occidental yo tu il ella it noi vu ili (illos, ellas)\n\nThe variants illa and ella both exist for third person singular feminine.H. Jacob on Occidental (1947). Read 3 November 2013. The pronoun expressing politeness is vu, which behaves like second person plural. The indefinite personal pronoun \"one\" is on in Occidental. If necessary, one can specify the gender of third person plural by using illos (masculine) or ellas (feminine).\n\nIn the object form the pronouns are: me, te, le, la, it, nos, vos, and les (with los and las as specific masculine and feminine forms, respectively). In the oblique case, the pronouns are me, te, il (or le), noi (or nos), voi (or vos), and ili (or les), varying by user and situation outside of the forms me and te.Cosmoglotta B, 1947, p. 45 The possessive pronouns are mi, tui, su (his/her/its), nor, vor and lor. They may be pluralized: li mi (mine, singular), li mis (mine, plural), li nor (ours, singular), li nores (ours, plural).\n\nGrammatical endings are used to a certain extent, though to a lesser degree than languages such as Esperanto and Ido where parts of speech are marked with obligatory endings. Only a few parts of speech (such as verb infinitives) in Interlingue have entirely obligatory endings, while many others either have endings the usage of which is optional and sometimes recommended. Some grammatical endings are:\n\nar, er, ir: verb infinitive. far (to do), posser (be able), scrir (to write)\ne: the general substantival (noun) ending used obligatorily to differentiate nouns from other parts or speech, for reasons of pronunciation, or optionally for euphony. Examples of obligatory -e endings: capitale (capital, noun) vs. capital (capital, adjective), contenete (content) vs, contenet (contained), sud (south, adjective) vs. sude (south as an independent noun, as in the north and the south). A final -e is recommended in words ending with -s to avoid confusion with the plural (farse, curse, sense), -ir, -er- and -ar endings to avoid confusion with the verb infinitive (dangere, desire, papere), and other such areas where its addition aids in differentiation or pronunciation.Occidental B, 1947, p. 24 Optional -e endings: can or cane (dog), Pentecost or Pentecoste (Pentecost). The -e and other endings are often omitted for poetic or euphonic reasons.Poem in Cosmoglotta 289 (summer 2000) with unwritten endings in parenthesis: Quo es li vive? On mori lent, li fin silent...Un promenad(a) in verdi parc(o). Nu flores resta sur li sarc(o)...Quo es li vive? Un rubi ros(e), mysterios(i), quel lentmen perdi su color(e). Quo resta? Solmen li dolor(e)...Quo es li vive? Tristess(e)? Chagrin(e)?  Li mort(e) - - e fin(e)? Partú triumfa li amor(e), quam ombre fugi li dolor(e)! Quo es li vive? Tam bell, tam brev(i)... Un dulci rev(e) - Un gay canzon quam sol(e) aurin. Yo va amar it til li fin(e)!!\ni: the general adjectival ending, similar to -e in usage. Examples of obligatory -i endings: pigri (lazy), acri (sharp) for ease of pronunciation, verdi (green, adjective) to distinguish from verde (green, noun). Examples of optional -i endings: etern vs. eterni (eternal), imens vs. imensi (immense).\na: nouns that end in e formed from an -ar verb are often written with the -a ending if one wishes to emphasize the verbal (active) aspect. A me veni un pensa (a thought occurred to me) vs. Penses e paroles (thoughts and words). The a ending also makes nouns feminine: anglese (English person), angleso (Englishman), anglesa (English woman). This does not apply to nouns that on their own indicate the gender (patre, matre).\no: indicates the masculine gender in the same way a indicates the feminine.\n\n Correlatives \nWhile correlatives were not designed to match a pre-determined scheme, the majority of them do match the prefixes and suffixes shown in the chart below.\n\nQU- (interrogative/relative)T- (demonstrative)ALQU- (undefined)NEQU- (negative)-CUNC (indeterminate)Ø(collective)  -I (persons, standard demonstrative)qui (who)ti (this)alqui (someone)nequi (nobody)quicunc (whoever)omni (every, all) -O (things)quo (what)to (that)alquo (something)nequo (nothing)quocunc (whatever)omno (all)  -EL (both persons and things)quel (which)tel (such)alquel (any)nequelquelcunc (whichever)chascun (each, all) -AL (quality)qual (which, what a)tal (that)alqual (any kind)nequalqualcunc -AM (way, mode)quam (as)tam (so)alquam (anyhow)nequamquamcunc (however) -ANT (quantity)quant (how many)tant (so much)alquant (somewhat)nequantquantcunc -ANDE (time)quande (when)tande (then)alquandenequande (never)quandecuncsempre (always, ever) -U (place)u (where)ci / ta (here / there)alcu (somewhere)necu (nowhere)ucunc (anywhere)partú (everywhere)\nAlcun (some) and necun (no, none) are respectively the adjectives of alquel and nequel\n\nThe -qui series has optional accusative forms ending in -em: quem, alquem, nequem\n\nThe -al series is adverbialized with the -men ending: qualmen (how) talmen (that way)\n\nThe -el and -al series can take the plural ending: queles, quales\n\n Verbs \nVerbs in Interlingue have three endings: -ar, -er, and -ir, and are invariable. Conjugation is carried out with a combination of endings and auxiliary verbs. The verb esser (to be) is written es in the present due to its high frequency.\n+FormInterlingueEnglishNotesInfinitivear / er / iramar / decider / scrirto love / to decide / to writeSimple presenta / e / iyo ama / decide / scriI love / decide / writePast -tyo amat / decidet / scritI loved / decided / wrotestress thus falls on the last syllable: yo amatPerfectha + tyo ha amat / decidet / scritI have loved / decided / writtenha on its own is not a verb (to have = haver)Pluperfecthat + tyo hat amat / decidet / scritI had loved / decided / writtenFutureva + inf.yo va amar / decider / scrirI will love / decide / writeva on its own is not a verb (to go = ear or vader)Future in the pastvat + inf.yo vat amar / decider / scrirI was going to love / to decide / to writePerfect futureva har + tyo va har amat / decidet / scritI will have loved / decided / writtenImperativea! / e! / i!ama! / decide! / scri!love! / decide! / write!Imperative of esser is esse.Conditionalvell + inf.yo vell amar / decider / scrirI would love / decide / writeAlso used for hearsay: Un acusation secun quel il vell har esset... - An accusation alleging him to have been...  \n(lit. an accusation according to which he would have been...)Precativeples + inf.ples amar! / decider! / scrir!please love! / please / write!Hortativelass + inf.lass nos amar! / decider! / scrir!let's love! / decide! / write!Optativemey + inf.yo mey amar / decider / scrirI may love / decide / writeOnly the same as English may in the optative mood (as in \"may his days be long\", not \"I may or may not go\")Present participle -ntamant / decident / scrientloving / deciding / writing -ir verbs become -ientGerund (adverbial participle) -nteamante / decidente / scriente(while) loving / deciding / writing -ir verbs become -iente\nThe present participle is used to qualify nouns: un cat ama, un amant cat (a cat loves, a loving cat) and is often seen in adjectives such as fatigant (tiring, from fatigar, to tire). The gerund is used to indicate another action or state of being going on at the same time: scriente un missage, yo videt que... (writing a message, I saw that...).\n\nMany further combinations of endings and auxiliary verbs are possible. Some examples:\n\nYo vell har amat = I would have loved\n\nYo vell har esset amat = I would have been loved\n\nHante retornat al dom... = Having returned to the house... (ha + gerund)\n\nOther notes on verbs:\n\nThe subjunctive does not exist in Interlingue: yo vole que tu ama (I want you to love). Mey is often used to express it when necessary, however: Yo vole que tu mey amar (I want you to love, lit. I want that you may love).\n\nHay is a standalone verb that means there is or there are. Hay du homes in li dom (there are two people in the house). As a standalone verb there is no official infinitive but users of the language often conjugate it as if there were (hayat, etc.) Other ways of expressing there is or there are: esser (esset nequó altri a far = there was nothing else to do), exister (it existe du metodes = there are two ways), trovar se (in li cité trova se tri cavalles = there are three horses in the city), etc.\n\nThe passive is formed using the verb esser: yo es amat (I am loved). Se makes the verb refer to itself (reflexive form) which often functions as a shorter way to form the passive: li frontieras esset cludet = li frontieras cludet se (the borders were closed).\n\nThe progressive tense (-nt) is not used with the same frequency as in English (what are you doing? = quo tu fa?, not quo tu es fant?). It emphasizes the continuity of the verb and is often used in storytelling (noi esset marchant vers li rivere quande... = we were walking towards the river when...)\n\nThe verb star (to stand) may be used to emphasize the completion of a verb: li dom sta constructet (the house stands constructed, i.e. it is completely built)\n\nThe verb ear (to go) may be used to emphasize the continuity of a verb: li dom ea constructet (the house is being built).\n\nAdverbs are formed with the ending -men (rapid = quick, rapidmen = quickly). The ending may be omitted when the meaning is clear: tu deve far it rapid(men) = you must do it quick(ly).\n\nThe double negative is permitted, and was even recommended by de Wahl for its internationality and precision. De Wahl gave the following phrase as an example: \"Yo ha trovat li libre, quem vu ha dat me, in null loc, quem vu ha indicat me\" (lit. I found the book you gave me nowhere you indicated me, thus \"I didn't find the book anywhere you told me to look\"). In this phrase, not permitting a double negative would result in ambiguity up to the word null, the only indication of a negative in the phrase, recommending Yo ne ha trovat li libre...in null loc. An obligatory double negative was never imposed and later Occidentalists found that they rarely used it, but it remained permitted and is seen from time to time.\n\nThe infinitive may also used as a mild or impersonal imperative: ne fumar - no smoking; bon comprender: un crímine es totvez un crímine - let's be clear (lit. understand well): a crime is still a crime.\n\n Derivation \nthumb|An example of derivation from the magazine Cosmoglotta.\nThe application of de Wahl's rule to verbs and the usage of numerous suffixes and prefixes was created to resolve irregularities that had plagued creators of language projects before Occidental, who were forced to make the choice between regularity and innatural forms, or irregularity and natural forms. The prevailing view was that natural forms needed to be sacrificed for the sake of regularity, while those that opted for naturality were forced to admit numerous irregularities when doing so (Idiom Neutral for example was forced to create a list of 81 verbs with special radicals used when forming derivatives). The rules created by Edgar de Wahl to resolve this are:\n\nIf, after the removal of -r or -er of the infinitive, the root ends in a vowel, the final -t is added. Crear (to create), crea/t-, crea/t/or, crea/t/ion, crea/t/iv, crea/t/ura.\nIf the root ends in consonants d or r, they are changed into s: decid/er (to decide), deci/s-, deci/s/ion deci/s/iv. Adherer (to adhere), adhe/s-, adhe/s/ion\nIn all other cases, with six exceptions, the removal of the ending gives the exact root: duct/er, duct-, duct/ion.\n\nOnce these rules were applied, Occidental was left with six exceptions. They are:\n\nced/er, cess- (concession)\nsed/er, sess- (session)\nmov/er, mot- (motion)\nten/er, tent- (temptation)\nvert/er, vers- (version)\nveni/r, vent- (advent)\n\nSuffixes are added either to the verbal root or the present theme of the verb (the infinitive minus -r). An example of the latter is the suffix -ment: move/r, move/ment (not movetment), experi/r, experi/ment (not experitment), and -ntie (English -nce): tolera/r (tolerate), tolera/ntie, existe/r (exist), existe/ntie.\n\n Affixes \nThe major prefixes and suffixes used in word derivation in Interlingue are added to either the present theme (infinitive minus -r), verbal root (infinitive minus two preceding vowels), or perfect theme (present theme + t or +s for verbs finishing with -d or -r) of verbs, as well as other types of speech. The below is a sample of some of the affixes used.\n\n+affixmeaningaffixed tobefore affixafter affixnotes -abil/-ibilableverbal rootposser (to be able)possibil (possible) -abil for -ar verbs, -ibil for -er and -ir verbs -ada/-ida -adeverbal rootpromenar (to stroll)promenada (a walk, a promenade) -ada for -ar verbs, -ida for -er and -ir verbs -ach-pejorativeverbal rootcriticar (criticize)criticachar (complain, whine) -argeneral verbnoun, adjectivesicc (dry)siccar (to dry)General verb final in most cases for all modern verbs -ardpejorative noun suffixverbal rootfurter (steal)furtard (thief)bel-kinship by marriagenounfratre (brother)belfratre (brother-in-law)des-cessationvariousinfectar (infect)\navantage (advantage)desinfectar (disinfect)\ndesavantage (disadvantage)dis-separation, dispertionvariousmembre (member)\nsemar (sow, seminate)dismembrar (dismember)\ndissemar (disseminate) -er-doer of verbverbal rootlavar (wash)lavere / lavera / lavero (washer) -a or -o to specify female or male gender -ettediminutivenoundom (house)domette (cottage)ex-ex-nounpresidente (president)ex-presidente (ex-president)ho-thisnounsemane (week)ho-semane (this week) -illiocaressivenounfratre (brother)fratrillio (bro)affixed to male nounsín-in-, un-, etc.adjectivecredibil (believable)íncredibil (unbelievable) -inniacaressivenounmatre (mother)matrinnia (mom/mommy)affixed to female nouns -ion -ionperfect themecrear (create)creation (creation) -iv -iveperfect themeexploder (explode)explosiv (explosive)perfect theme: explod-er --> explod --> explos -ment -mentpresent themeexperir (to experience)experiment (experiment)mi-halfnounfratre (brother)mifratre (half-brother)mis-false (mis-)variouscomprender (understand)miscomprender (misunderstand)non-non-nounfumator (smoker)nonfumator (non-smoker) -ntie -ncepresent themetolerar (tolerate)\nexperir (to experience)tolerantie (tolerance)\nexperientie (experience) -ir verbs add an e: ir --> ientie -or -er, -orperfect themedistribuer (distribute)distributor (distributor) -ori -oryperfect themecurrer (run)cursori (cursory)perfect theme: curr-er --> curr --> cursper-through, all the wayverbforar (pierce)perforar (perforate)pre-beforevarioushistorie (history)prehistorie (prehistory)pro-to the frontverbducter (lead)producter (produce)re-re-verbvenir (come)revenir (return)step-step-nounmatre (mother)stepmatre (stepmother) -ura -ureperfect themescrir (write)scritura (scripture)\n\n Ease of learning \nAs an international auxiliary language, ease of learning through regular derivation and recognizable vocabulary was a key principle in Occidental's creation. The magazine Cosmoglotta often featured letters from new users and former users of other international languages (primarily Esperanto and Ido) attesting to the language's simplicity: letters from new users to demonstrate their quick command of the language, and attestations from experienced auxiliary language users to share their experiences. Because many users of Occidental had encountered the language after gaining experience in others, objective data on learnability of the language is difficult to find. One experiment to ascertain learning time was carried out however in the years 1956 to 1957 in a Swiss Catholic high school (gymnasium) in Disentis on the time required to learn the language. The experiment showed that the students participating in the study, who had previous experience with French, Latin, and Greek, mastered both written and spoken Interlingue after 30 hours of study. \n\nExample texts\n\nTranslation: \"Material civilization, science, and even art unify themselves more and more. The educated European feels himself almost at home in all lands that have European civilization, that is, more and more, in the entire world. Today almost all states war with the same armaments. Without pause the modes of intercommunication improve, and in consequence from that the world seems to decrease. A Parisian is now closer to an Englishman or a German than he was a hundred years before to a French peasant.\"\n\n+Lord's PrayerInterlingue/OccidentalInterlinguaLatin (traditional)English (traditional)Patre nor, qui es in li cieles,\nmey tui nómine esser sanctificat,\nmey tui regnia venir,\nmey tui vole esser fat,\nqualmen in li cieles talmen anc sur li terre.\nDa nos hodie nor pan omnidial,\ne pardona nor débites,\nqualmen anc noi pardona nor debitores.\nE ne inducte nos in tentation,\nma libera nos de lu mal.\nAmen.Patre nostre, qui es in le celos,\nque tu nomine sia sanctificate;\nque tu regno veni;\nque tu voluntate sia facite\ncomo in le celo, etiam super le terra.\nDa nos hodie nostre pan quotidian,\ne pardona a nos nostre debitas\ncomo etiam nos los pardona a nostre debitores.\nE non induce nos in tentation,\nsed libera nos del mal.\nAmen.Pater noster, qui es in cælis,\nsanctificetur nomen tuum.\nAdveniat regnum tuum.\nFiat voluntas tua,\nsicut in cælo, et in terra.\nPanem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie,\net dimitte nobis debita nostra,\nsicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.\nEt ne nos inducas in tentationem,\nsed libera nos a malo.\nAmen.Our father, who art in heaven,\nhallowed be thy name;\nthy kingdom come,\nthy will be done.\non earth, as it is in heaven.\nGive us this day our daily bread;\nand forgive us our debts\nas we have forgiven our debtors.\nAnd lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from evil.\nAmen.\n\n+New Year's greeting from Cosmoglotta B published in Switzerland, 1942 Occidental  English Si noi vell viver ancor in li felici témpor quel precedet li guerre universal, tande anc li present articul vell reflecter li serenitá per quel noi acustomat salutar li comensa de un nov annu.

We can no longer pronounce these words without feeling their terrible banality and absolute lack of meaning. The future is beyond dark and it promises us more suffering than rays of hope.

    "text": "John Penn Mayberry (18 November 1939 – 19 August 2016) was an American mathematical philosopher and creator of a distinctive Aristotelian philosophy of mathematics to which he gave expression in his book The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets. Following completion of a Ph.D. at Illinois under the supervision of Gaisi Takeuti, he took up, in 1966, a position in the mathematics department of the University of Bristol where he remained until his retirement in 2004 as a Reader in Mathematics.\n\nPhilosophical work\n\nOn the one hand, Mayberry's philosophy rejects the Platonic tradition, which holds mathematics to be a transcendental science concerned with discovering truths about immaterial, but intelligible, objective entities, as metaphysically conceited. This stance sets him apart from what probably is the “silent majority” view among practising mathematicians. Roger Penrose eloquently expresses a typical Platonic position.\n\n“The natural numbers were there before there were human beings or indeed any other creatures here in earth, and they will remain after all life has perished. It has always been the case that each natural number is the sum of four squares and it did not have to wait for Lagrange to conjure this fact into existence.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Mayberry also vehemently rejects any understanding of mathematics tainted, as he would think of it, by operationalism. He writes:\n\n“I take operationalism in mathematics to be the doctrine that the foundations of mathematics are to be discovered in the activities (actual or idealised) of mathematicians when they count, calculate, write down proofs, invent symbols, draw diagrams and so on. …… Considerations of human activities and capacities, actual or idealised, have no place in the foundations of mathematics, and we must make every effort to exclude them from the elements, principles and methods on which we intend to base our mathematics.”\n \nThe most archetypal and most universally promulgated of such operationalist doctrines is that the natural numbers can be constructed  beginning with 1, adding 1 to get 2, adding 1 again to get 3 and continuing indefinitely. This is expressed by the notation N = 1, 2, 3 …….  where the dots denote the indefinite replication of “adding 1”.  In accepting these dots of ellipsis, one accepts the intelligibility of indefinite iteration.  Mayberry does not believe that a definition of this type is sufficiently clear and sufficiently disentangled from naïve and possibly misguided intuitions about the nature of time as to warrant its inclusion in mathematics without further justification. He writes:\n\n“When the natural number system is taken as the primary datum, something simply “given”, it is natural to see the principles of proof by mathematical induction and definition by recursion along that system as “given” as well.  ….. The natural numbers are thus seen as what we arrive at in the process of counting out: 1,2 ….. where the dots of ellipsis “…..” are seen as somehow self-explanatory – after all, we know how to continue the count, no matter how far we have taken it. But these dots of ellipsis contain the whole mystery of the notion of natural number! .... Nor are the operations of counting out or calculating to be taken as primary data: they must be analysed in terms of more fundamental notions. We are thus led to reject the operationalism that all the anti-Cantorian schools share.\nFor us moderns, numbers take their being from what we can do with them, namely count and calculate: but Greek “numbers” (arithmoi) were objects in their own right with simple intelligible natures. Our natural numbers are things we can (in principle) construct (by counting out to them): Greek numbers were simply “there”, so to speak. .......\nI am convinced that this operationalist conception of natural number is the central fallacy that underlies all our thinking about the foundations of mathematics. It is not confined to heretics but is shared by the orthodox Cantorian majority.”\n  \nHis stance puts him at odds not just with pedagogic practice over the last few centuries but also with a tradition going back to antiquity.  In Definition 4 of Book V of his Elements, Euclid defines two magnitudes of the same type, A and B, to  “have a ratio to one another” as follows:\n\n\"Magnitudes are said to have a ratio to one another which are capable when multiplied of exceeding one another”\n\nIn other words, if the repeated addition of one of them, say A, to itself results in a magnitude that exceeds the other, say B,  i.e. for some natural number n, nA > B. Conversely A and B are do not have a ratio to one another if the indefinitely repeated addition of one of them to itself never produces a magnitude exceeding the other.  In Book V Euclid develops a general theory of ratios and in Book VI demonstrates the power of the ratio concept both greatly to simplify derivations given in Books I - IV and to extend the scope of some of the theorems of Books I –IV. Particularly notable examples are Book III Prop. 35, where a much simpler proof using similar triangles is immediately available, and Book VI Prop. 31 where he extends Pythagoras’ theorem from squares to general similar figures.\n\nIn Book VII Euclid introduces, as another type of magnitude alongside his geometric ones of  line, angle and figure, the concept of “arithmos”. This is to be understood as “a multitude of units” where a unit is “that by which we call something a one”.  With some reservations about the status of singletons and the empty set, the Greek notion of “arithmos” is thus essentially the modern notion of “set”. Mayberry notes that it struck him with the force of a revelation that the significance of Euclid's Common Notion 5, - “the whole is greater than the part” - when applied to arithmoi is that an arithmos cannot be congruent, where this word is understood following Heath  as “can be placed upon with an exact fit”, to any proper part of itself, or, in other words, that a set is finite in the modern sense of there being no 1-1 correspondence between the set and a proper subset of itself. The fact that Greek arithmetic, and in particular Euclid  Books VII-IX,  is really the study of finite sets has been obscured by the ubiquitous translation of “arithmos” as “number” and the transformation in the notion of number from its original “arithmos” meaning to \"ratio\" that occurred in the 17th century. The transformation in meaning was given clear expression by Newton in his Lectures.\n\n“By number I mean not so much a multitude of unities as the abstracted Ratio  of any Quantity to another Quantity of the same kind which we take for Unity”\n\nMayberry's convictions as to the true historical sequence of events in the development of key mathematical concepts are central to his philosophical orientation. He was led to these by his reading of Jacob Klein's \"Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra\". and Richard Dedekind's memoir \"Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen\".\n\nFrom the middle of the 17th to the 19th century the natural numbers and the notion of unlimited iteration on which they rely acquired foundational status in mathematics, both pragmatically and philosophically.  On the philosophical side, Kant classified arithmetic propositions as synthetic a priori knowledge and, in parallel with a similar analysis of geometric theorems which he traced to our intuition of space, traced their compelling nature to our intuition of time. Kant's general position with regard to Arithmetic received the endorsement of the greatest practising mathematicians of the 19th century. Even Gauss, though in dissent from Kant's position on the status of geometry, endorsed his position on Arithmetic.\n \n“I am coming ever more to the conviction that the necessity of our geometry cannot be proved, at least not by human comprehension for human comprehension. Perhaps in another life we will come to other views on the nature of space which are currently obtainable for us. Until then one must not put Geometry in the same rank as Arithmetic, which stands a priori, but rather in the same rank as, say, Mechanics.”\n\nAlmost a century later Poincare writes:\n\n“In this domain of Arithmetic we may think ourselves very far from the infinitesimal analysis, but the idea of mathematical infinity is already playing a preponderating role, and without it there would be no science at all, because there would be nothing general. …… We cannot therefore escape the conclusion that the rule of reasoning by recurrence is irreducible to the principle of r contradiction . … This rule, inaccessible to analytical proof and to experiment, is the exact type of the à priori synthetic intuition.”.\n\nOf the significant figures in the 19th century, only Dedekind appears to have stood against the Kantian consensus. In Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen, he coolly writes:\n\n“In speaking of arithmetic, (algebra, analysis) as a part of logic, I mean to imply that I consider the number concept entirely independent of the notions or intuitions of space and time.”.\n\nDedekind, whom Mayberry greatly admired, showed that the natural numbers could be established without any dependence on a Kantian intuition of time or reliance on indefinitely repeated operations. He did so however on the basis of  an explicit acceptance of Cantor's Axiom of Infinity, which, as Mayberry points out, is best understood as simply a contradiction of Euclid's Common Notion 5 as applied to arithmoi. Dedekind's work did not however cause the view that the natural numbers and iterative processes have a special foundational status to lose credit among most mathematicians. The Intuitionist movement, while sharing with Mayberry a rejection of a Platonist understanding of the meaning of mathematics, resorted to an operationalist understanding of the subject, driving an acceptance of indefinitely protracted iterative processes to the very heart of their thinking. The Formalist movement, following Hilbert's program of saving the mathematical fruits of Cantor's Axiom of Infinity via finitary consistency proofs, likewise, in the very definitions of formal systems and the establishment of their properties, accorded a special status to indefinite iteration and associated definitions by recursion and proofs by induction.\n\nMayberry's position is that all of this, right from Book V of Euclid, constitutes an aberration from the true spirit of mathematics as exemplified in Euclid Books I-IV. The central purpose of his book is to explain his position and to show that it is not corrosive of the essential content or the modern practice of mathematics, but, in his recommendation of a clearer Aristotelian understanding of what mathematics is about and the standard of rigour appropriate to his more exigent understanding of meaning, he is following in a tradition initiated by Cantor of restoring meaning to mathematics after three centuries of formalism. However, in Mayberry's eyes a modern platonically inspired doctrine that holds that say, proper classes, objectively exist is as much a departure from good sense and probable truthfulness as, say, the  early 19th century formalistically inspired doctrine, Peacock's “Principle of the equivalence of Permanent Forms”.\n\nMayberry's positive philosophical views flow from his determined adherence to a small number of philosophical doctrines inspired partly by Aristotle and partly by reflection on the almost two and a half millennia of mathematical experience, particularly that of the 19th century.\n\nHe is an Aristotelian realist in basic agreement with Aristotle's opinion that mathematics, and in particular the study of arithmoi, is a natural science taking its place alongside other special interest scientific subjects such as entomology or ornithology and dealing with objectively existing this-worldly things. Aristotle writes:\n\n“Universal assertions in mathematics are not about separable entities which are beyond and apart from magnitudes and arithmoi. They are about these very things, only not qua such things as have magnitude or are divisible.\"\n\n(What Aristotle means is that in geometry one treats the specific sizes of concrete objects as accidental and irrelevant to the geometer, and in arithmetic, one similarly ignores the fact that concrete units - men, pebbles etc. - may, in fact, be divisible.)\n\nand elsewhere:\n\n`Each science deals with its own domain, so that the science of the healthy is what studies something qua healthy and the science of man is what studies something qua man. And the same goes for geometry. The sciences of mathematics are not going to take perceptible entities as their domain just because the things they are about have the accidental feature of being perceptible (though, of course they are not studied qua perceptible). But, on the other hand, neither will they take as their domain some other entities separable from the perceptible ones.\".\n \nThe science that Mayberry concerns himself with is Arithmetic, understood both in a purified version of the sense Euclid gives the word in Books VII – IX, and also, as he claims, in the sense that Cantor has given the word.  The first of Mayberry's core positions is agreement with Aristotle that the Arithmetician studies things and certain pluralities of things qua units and arithmoi in an essentially analogous way to the entomologist's study of things and certain pluralities of things qua insects and insect colonies. He accepts Euclid's lapidary definition of “unit”, demurring only from Heath's translation of “εκαστον των οντων“ as “each of the things that exist” as philosophically overloaded  In regard to the definition of “arithmos” Mayberry would crucially prefix  the word “multitude” in  Euclid's definition - “ An arithmos is a multitude composed of units” - with the word “definite”. By this he means that arithmoi have definite objectively existing, bounds or limits – not in the sense that arithmoi are constrained in size or are amenable to any operational procedure such as counting out, or comprise exactly those things for which some linguistically formulated condition holds, but only in the sense that it is true of any individual thing that it is either in the arithmos or not in it. In particular conformity to Common Notion 5 (whole greater than the part) is not implied in the very concept “arithmos” but merely a judgement that all arithmoi possess, as it happens, this property.  For pluralities defined by conformity to some condition or correspondence with some common noun – e.g. “arithmoi with more than three units” or “horses” – Mayberry uses the Aristotelian word \"species\". A species exists merely because we can conceive it: it is not an objective thing in the world but a thought in our heads, while the things that fall into a species may or may not coincide with an arithmos. Similar remarks apply to other conceptions such as \"property\" - e.g. that of being and ordinal or \"global function\" e.g. the Power Set and Union operators. Mayberry writes :\n\n“The essential difference between sets and species is that sets exist whereas species do not. By this I mean that species are not objects: they are fictions or virtual objects .”\n \n\"But it is essential to remember that in the final analysis - and all talk about global functions of the various sorts to the contrary notwithstanding - there are no such things as global functions: and when we speak of such functions we are ultimately talking about our own notational conventions for referring to sets.\"\n\nThe second of Mayberry's core philosophical doctrines is that things and arithmoi of things objectively exist and are part of the fabric of external reality. The ontological credentials of an arithmos are exactly those of its constituent units.  It is not however the task of the mathematician to investigate or speculate whether things falling into a species – such as clouds in the sky, shades of red, human emotional states, men of the 22nd century – are sufficiently clearly individuated to constitute units of possible arithmoi or whether the boundaries of pluralities of things – e.g. should we count centaurs and mermaids as falling into the species “human kind”? is it exactly determined when shades of red end and shades of purple begin ? -  are sufficiently clearly delineated as to constitute an arithmos. The work of the arithmetician can begin with the simple assumption that there are objective clearly individuated things which he can take as units and definite pluralities of such things that he can take as arithmoi. Mayberry writes:\n\n“In Aristotle’s conception of mathematical number we have the best vehicle yet devised  to account for the facts of theoretical arithmetic. In arithmetical reasoning the mathematician regards things in the most abstract and general way conceivable, namely, only in so far as they are subject to the laws of identity and difference. That there are things subject to such laws he simply takes for granted.”\n \nand, a little later on:\n\n“Number in the original sense, however – arithmoi – pluralities composed of units- these things are not like “natural numbers”, mere fabrications of the mind, but on the contrary, are authentic inhabitants of the world, independent of human beings and their mental activity; they are things that we are obliged to acknowledge if we are to make any sense at all of our mathematical experience.”\n\nThe third of Mayberry's core philosophical doctrines is that definitions made, properties defined,  and arguments constructed using the quantifies “For all” and “There exist”  are only intelligible, as statements of objective fact, if the scope of each quantifier is restricted to a definite arithmos. So, for instance, if we are dealing with girls, qua units, and know how to compare two girls in respect of the property “clever”   we can sensibly say “Joan is the cleverest girl in her class” but not “Joan is the cleverest girl” tout court, as the latter statement purports to quantify over all the things falling into the species “girl”.  This stance gives him an additional reason to reject the foundational pretensions of the two classical first order axiomatic systems of Peano Arithmetic and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Not only does he object to the operationalism inherent in the very construction of such formal systems, but he now also rejects the intelligibility of the free use of unrestricted quantifiers in the formation of predicates in the axiom schemata of Induction and Replacement.\n\nMayberry's fourth core doctrine is connected with his third. He affirms that in dealing with units and arithmoi -  i.e. with things - we can unproblematically use classical logic, whereas in dealing with thoughts – such as species, global functions, general constructions properties etc. – the appropriate logic is intuitionistic. In particular if we know that the assumption \"All members of the arithmos  a possess the property P\" implies an absurdity, then we can legitimately infer \"there exists some member of a, x, for which P(x) does not hold\". However, if we make a statement using a quantifier over a species e.g. \"there exists some thing possessing P\" or \"P holds of all things\" we are no longer reporting an objective fact that must be either the case or not the case. The affirmer of such a statement has to be understood as making a claim that he has in mind a justification of it – i.e. in the case of a universal quantifier, grounds for believing that given any conceivable thing P holds of it, or in the case of an existential quantifier, he knows of an instance of the species for which P holds. Since statements incorporating unrestricted quantifiers must be understood subjectively, it is clear that Excluded Middle principle is then simply not valid.  For instance if the meaning of “For all things P holds\" is “I have in mind a general construction to produce for each thing an argument that P holds of that thing\" and the meaning of \"there exist a thing for which P does not hold\" is  \"I have in mind a construction to produce a thing for which P fails to hold.” then I cannot necessarily assert that the disjunction is true as  I may, for instance, have no constructions at all in mind.   On this topic Mayberry writes:\n  \n“What are the logical principles that should govern global quantification? This is a difficult question and I am not confident that I can answer it in full. But I propose to adopt a partial answer, namely Brouwer’s Principle:\n(i)\tConventional (i.e. what Brouwer calls ‘classical’ ) logic is the logic of finite domains. In particular the mathematical laws of quantification apply only when the domains of quantification are finite. [“finite” here is being used in Mayberry’s sense of “definite” or “delimited” – the defining characteristic of arithmoi.] \n(ii)\tPropositions that require global quantification for their expression cannot be assigned conventional truth values, true or false. They can only be classified as justified or unjustified.\n.....\nThen in accordance with Brouwer’s Principle the assertion “For all objects x in S (x)” is not a conventional (“classical”) proposition with a determinate truth value. It is not true or false but justified or unjustified. \nTo say that such a proposition is justified is to say that we have grounds for asserting that any proposition of the form (t) is true where t is any expression that denotes, or could denote an object. To say that an assertion is unjustified, on the other hand, is merely to say that we do not have such grounds; and that is not the same thing as saying that we have grounds for denying it.”\n\nMayberry's fifth core doctrine is that, broadly in analogy with Euclid's postulates for Geometry, postulates for Arithmetic can be laid down, making a good a defect in the Elements which, contrary to the expectations created by the structure Common Notions and Postulates for Geometry, do not contain any such postulates. Mayberry carries out this program in Chapter 4 of his book. His postulates follow, to some degree Euclid in form, but the axiomatic ideas about sets issuing from the 19th and early 20th centuries, in content. Broadly analogous to Euclid's postulates on the construction of a circle given a point and a line or the construction of a unique straight line given two points are the postulates to do with Union, Power Set and Cartesian product which posit global constructions producing new arithmoi from one or more given ones. Somewhat different however are his postulates on Replacement and Comprehension. These do not set out individual constructions which simply have to be grasped but rather make affirmations about all possible constructions and all conceivable properties. In a sense one can understand them as affirming the existence of general bridges from thoughts to things. Both however can, like the postulates concerning specific constructions, be understood as \"finiteness principles\" affirming the existence of new arithmoi. Mayberry's “corrected” Euclid would thus underpin the sister disciplines of Geometry and Arithmetic with Common Notions, applicable to both, supplemented by two sets of Postulates, one for each discipline. Indeed, in so far as Geometry does rely on the notion of arithmos – it does so even in defining triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons etc., but more exigently in some Propositions, e.g.. Book VI Prop. 31, which make affirmations about general polygons - the “corrected” Euclid would place the study of Arithmoi before that of Geometry.\n\nThe final item of Mayberry's core philosophy is his belief  that in Euclid's failure to recognise the force  of  Common Notion 5 – when applied to arithmoi a great historical opportunity was missed and, in his allowing himself definition by iteration, a huge misstep was taken  whose consequences have ramified through the history of mathematics. Equipped with a proper appreciation of Common Notion 5 and eschewing iteration, a “corrected” Euclid would have pursued those parts of mathematics that are  concerned with the finite –  in addition to the actual modest content  of  Books 7-9, natural number theory, finite  combinatorics, finite group and field theory and more generally the study of finite structures. Mayberry's calls this subject Euclidean Arithmetic and devotes a considerable part of his book to developing the basics of it. He is concerned in particular with establishing to what degree proof by induction and definition by recursion are at all warranted. He shows that, far from the Euclidean theory of arithmoi being a minor rework of modern natural number theory, in fact no viable notion of the natural numbers can be established in Euclidean Arithmetic.  Complementing his view on Euclidean Arithmetic Mayberry takes the view that, just as an alternative Geometries were created by denying Euclid's axiom of parallels, an alternative Arithmetic is created by denying Common Notion 5 and affirming the existence of at least one arithmos for which the whole can be put in 1-1 correspondence with a part. This theory, which Mayberry would prefer to name Cantorian Arithmetic, is of course, modern set theory, which has shown itself capable (arguably) of subsuming all of mathematics and in particular the Geometry which, in the Euclidean dispensation of adherence to Common Notion 5, is a separate sister discipline of Arithmetic.\n\nMayberry's philosophy seeks to impose a new standard, flowing from his ontological and semantic convictions, of clarity and rigour on mathematics to be achieved in the first instance through a program of systematic separation of Euclidean from Cantorian mathematics. In the Euclidean case this standard would require practitioners both of Geometry and Arithmetic to eschew all appeal to iterative processes. The consequent most immediate challenge in Geometry is to “correct” Euclid by establishing the theorems of Book VI on the basis of the methods and techniques of Books I-IV, avoiding the use of the ratio concept introduced in Book V. For Arithmetic the corresponding challenge is to establish the results of Book VII-IX without resort to the sort of iterative procedure that Euclid allows himself in the definition of multiplication. (Book VII, Definition 15.) For Cantorian Arithmetic the main challenge would be to show that the  great body of infinitary mathematics - the disciplines flowing in one way or another from the calculus - does not require unbounded quantifiers and consequently that the instances of the Replacement Schema of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms for set theory involving such quantifiers, are, as well as being disallowed by Mayberry's general philosophy, in any case technically redundant.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1939 births\nCategory:2016 deaths"

    "text": "This page lists notable examples of incomplete published mathematical proofs. Most of these  were accepted as correct for several years but later discovered to contain gaps. There are both examples where a complete proof was later found and where the alleged result turned out to be false.\n\nExamples\n\nThis section lists examples of proofs that were published and accepted as complete before a gap or error was found in them. It does not include any of the many incomplete attempted solutions by amateurs of famous problems such as Fermat's last theorem or the squaring of the circle. It also does not include unpublished preprints that were withdrawn because an error was found before publication.\n\nThe examples are arranged roughly in order of the publication date of the incomplete proof. Several of the examples on the list were taken from answers to questions on the MathOverflow site, listed in the external links below. The examples use the following symbols:\n Result is correct and was later rigorously proved.\n Result is wrong as stated, but a modified version was later rigorously proven.\n Status of the result is unclear\n Result is wrong as stated, but a modified version was suggested whose status is unclear.\n Result is wrong\n\n Euclid's Elements. Euclid's proofs are essentially correct, but strictly speaking sometimes contain gaps because he tacitly uses some unstated assumptions, such as the existence of intersection points. In 1899 David Hilbert gave a complete set of (second order) axioms for Euclidean geometry, called Hilbert's axioms, and between 1926 and 1959 Tarski gave some complete sets of first order axioms, called Tarski's axioms.\n Isoperimetric inequality. For three dimensions it states that the shape enclosing the minimum single volume for its surface area is the sphere. It was formulated by Archimedes but not proved rigorously until the 19th century, by Hermann Schwarz.\n Infinitesimals. In the 18th century there was widespread use of infinitesimals in calculus, though these were not really well defined. Calculus was put on firm foundations in the 19th century, and Robinson put infinitesimals in a rigorous basis with the introduction of nonstandard analysis in the 20th century.\n In 1759 Euler claimed that there were no closed knight tours on a chess board with 3 rows, but in 1917 Ernest Bergholt found  tours on 3 by 10 and 3 by 12 boards.\n Euler's conjecture on Graeco-Latin squares. In the 1780s Euler conjectured that no such squares exist for any oddly even number n ≡ 2 (mod 4). In 1959, R. C. Bose and S. S. Shrikhande constructed counterexamples of order 22. Then E. T. Parker found a counterexample of order 10 using a one-hour computer search. Finally Parker, Bose, and Shrikhande showed this conjecture to be false for all n ≥ 10.\n In 1798 A. M. Legendre claimed that 6 is not the sum of 2 rational cubes,Legendre, Adrien-Marie. Essai sur la théorie des nombres. 1798. which as Lamé pointed out in 1865 is false as 6 = (37/21)3 + (17/21)3.\n In 1803, Gian Francesco Malfatti claimed to prove that a certain arrangement of three circles would cover the maximum possible area inside a right triangle.  However, to do so he made certain unwarranted assumptions about the configuration of the circles.  It was shown in 1930 that circles in a different configuration could cover a greater area, and in 1967 that Malfatti's configuration was never optimal.  See Malfatti circles.\n In 1806 André-Marie Ampère claimed to prove that a continuous function is differentiable at most points (though it is not entirely clear what he was claiming as he did not give a precise definition of a function).  However, in 1872 Weierstrass gave an example of a continuous function that was not differentiable anywhere: The Weierstrass function.\n Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. In 1808 Legendre published an attempt at a proof of Dirichlet's theorem, but as Dupre pointed out in 1859 one of the lemmas used by Legendre is false. Dirichlet gave a complete proof in 1837.\n Uniform convergence. In his Cours d'analyse of 1821, Cauchy \"proved\" that if a sum of continuous functions converges pointwise, then its limit is also continuous.  However, Abel observed three years later that this is not the case.  For the conclusion to hold, \"pointwise convergence\" must be replaced with \"uniform convergence\". It is not entirely clear that Cauchy's original result was wrong, because his definition of pointwise convergence was a little vague and may have been stronger than the one currently in use, and there are ways to interpret his result so that it is correct.  There are many counterexamples using the standard definition of pointwise convergence.   For example, a Fourier series of sine and cosine functions, all continuous, may converge pointwise to a discontinuous function such as a step function.\n Intersection theory. In 1848 Steiner claimed that the number of conics tangent to 5 given conics is 7776 = 65, but later realized this was wrong. The correct number 3264 was found by Berner in 1865 and by Ernest de Jonquieres around 1859 and by Chasles in 1864 using his theory of characteristics. However these results, like many others in classical intersection theory, do not seem to have been given complete proofs until the work of Fulton and Macpherson in about 1978.\n Dirichlet's principle. This was used by Riemann in 1851, but Weierstrass found a counterexample to one version of this principle in 1870, and Hilbert stated and proved a correct version in 1900.\n The proofs of the Kronecker–Weber theorem by Kronecker (1853) and Weber (1886) both had gaps. The first complete proof was given by Hilbert in 1896.\n  incorrectly claimed that there are three different groups of order 6. This mistake is strange because in an earlier 1854 paper he correctly stated that there are just two such groups.\n In 1879, Alfred Kempe published a purported proof of the four color theorem, whose validity as a proof was accepted for eleven years before it was refuted by Percy Heawood. Peter Guthrie Tait gave another incorrect proof in 1880 which was shown to be incorrect by Julius Petersen in 1891. Kempe's proof did, however, suffice to show the weaker five color theorem. The four-color theorem was eventually proved by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken in 1976.\n Frege's foundations of mathematics in his 1879 book Begriffsschrift turned out to be inconsistent because of Russell's paradox, found in 1901.\n In 1885, Evgraf Fedorov classified the convex polyhedra with congruent rhombic faces, but missed a case. Stanko Bilinski in 1960 rediscovered the Bilinski dodecahedron (forgotten after its previous 1752 publication) and proved that, with the addition of this shape, the classification was complete..\n  Schröder–Bernstein theorem. In 1896 Schröder published a proof sketch which, however, was shown to be faulty by Alwin Reinhold Korselt in 1911 (confirmed by Schröder). – Original edition (1914)Korselt (1911), p.295\n Jordan curve theorem. There has been some controversy about whether Jordan's original proof of this in 1887 contains gaps. Oswald Veblen in 1905 claimed that Jordan's proof is incomplete, but in 2007 Hales  said that the gaps are minor and that Jordan's proof is essentially complete.\n Wronskians. In 1887 Mansion claimed in his textbook that if a Wronskian of some functions vanishes everywhere then the functions are linearly dependent. In 1889 Peano pointed out the counterexample x2 and x|x|. The result is correct if the functions are analytic.\n  published a purported example of an algebraic curve in 3-dimensional projective space that could not be defined as the zeros of 3 polynomials, but in 1941 Perron found 3 equations defining Vahlen's curve. In 1961 Kneser showed that any algebraic curve in projective 3-space can be given as the zeros of 3 polynomials.http://mathoverflow.net/questions/35476\n In 1898 Miller published a paper incorrectly claiming to prove that the Mathieu group M24 does not exist, though in 1900 he pointed out that his proof was wrong.\n Little claimed in 1900 that the writhe of a reduced knot diagram is an invariant. However, in 1974 Perko discovered a counterexample called the Perko pair, a pair of knots listed as distinct in tables for many years that are in fact the same.\n In 1905 Lebesgue tried to prove the (correct) result that a function implicitly defined by a Baire function is Baire, but his proof incorrectly assumed that the projection of a Borel set is Borel. Suslin pointed out the error and was inspired by it to define analytic sets as continuous images of Borel sets.\n Carmichael's totient function conjecture was stated as a theorem by Robert Daniel Carmichael in 1907, but in 1922 he pointed out that his proof was incomplete. As of 2016 the problem is still open.\n Hilbert's twenty-first problem. In 1908 Plemelj claimed to have shown the existence a Fuchsian differential equations with any given monodromy group, but in 1989 Bolibruch discovered a counterexample.\n Dehn's lemma. Dehn published an attempted proof in 1910, but Kneser found a gap in 1929. It was finally proved in 1956 by Christos Papakyriakopoulos.\n Italian school of algebraic geometry. Most gaps in proofs are caused either by a subtle technical oversight, or before the 20th century by a lack of precise definitions. A major exception to this is the Italian school of algebraic geometry in the first half of the 20th century, where lower standards of rigor gradually became acceptable. The result was that there are many papers in this area where the proofs are incomplete, or the theorems are not stated precisely. This list  contains a few representative examples, where the result was not just incompletely proved but also hopelessly wrong.\n Hilbert's sixteenth problem about the finiteness of the number of limit cycles of a plane polynomial vector field. Henri Dulac published a partial solution to this problem in 1923, but in about 1980 Écalle and Ilyashenko independently found a serious gap, and fixed it in about 1991.\n In 1925 Ackermann published a proof that a weak system can prove the consistency of a version of analysis, but von Neumann found an explicit mistake in it a few years later. Godel's incompleteness theorem showed that it is not possible to prove the consistency of analysis using weaker systems.\n In 1929 Lazar Lyusternik and Lev Schnirelmann published a proof of the theorem of the three geodesics, which was later found to be flawed. The proof was completed by Werner Ballmann about 50 years later.\n Groups of order 64. In 1930 Miller published a paper claiming that there are 294 groups of order 64. Hall and Senior showed in 1964 that the correct number is 267.\n Church's original published attempt in 1932 to define a formal system was inconsistent, as was his correction in 1933. The consistent part of his system later became the lambda calculus.\n Kurt Gödel proved in 1933 that the truth of a certain class of sentences of first-order arithmetic, known in the literature as [∃*∀2∃*, all, (0)], was decidable.  That is, there was a method for deciding correctly whether any statement of that form was true.  In the final sentence of that paper, he asserted that the same proof would work for the decidability of the larger class  [∃*∀2∃*, all, (0)]=, which also includes formulas that contain an equality predicate.  However, in the mid-1960s, Stål Aanderaa showed that Gödel's proof would not go through for the larger class, and in 1982 Warren Goldfarb showed that validity of formulas from the larger class was in fact undecidable.\n Grunwald–Wang theorem. Wilhelm Grunwald published an incorrect proof in 1933 of an incorrect theorem, and Whaples later published another incorrect proof. Shianghao Wang found a counterexample in 1948 and published a corrected version of the theorem in 1950.\n In 1934 Severi claimed that the space of rational equivalence classes of cycles on an algebraic surface is finite-dimensional, but  showed that this is false for surfaces of positive geometric genus.\n Littlewood–Richardson rule. Robinson published an incomplete proof in 1938, though the gaps were not noticed for many years. The first complete proofs were given by Marcel-Paul Schützenberger in 1977  and Thomas in 1974.\n Jacobian conjecture. Keller asked this as a question in 1939, and in the next few years there were several published incomplete proofs, including 3 by B. Segre,   but  Vitushkin found gaps in many of them. The Jacobian conjecture is (as of 2016) an open problem, and more incomplete proofs are regularly announced.  discuss the errors in some of these incomplete proofs.\n Quine published his original description of the system Mathematical Logic in 1940, but in 1942 Rosser showed it was inconsistent. Wang found a correction in 1950; the consistency of this revised system is still unclear.\n One of many examples from algebraic geometry in the first half of the 20th century:  claimed that  a degree-n surface in 3-dimensional projective space has at most ()−4 nodes, B. Segre pointed out that this was wrong; for example, for degree 6 the maximum number of nodes is 65, achieved by the Barth sextic, which is more than the maximum of 52 claimed by Severi.\n Rokhlin invariant.  incorrectly claimed that the third stable stem of the homotopy groups of spheres is of order 12. In 1952 he discovered his error: it is in fact cyclic of order 24. The difference is crucial as it results in the existence of the Rokhlin invariant, a fundamental tool in the theory of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds.\n Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields. In 1952 Heegner published a solution to this problem. His paper was not accepted as a complete proof as it contained a gap, and the first complete proofs were given in about 1967 by Baker and Stark. In 1969 Stark showed how to fill the gap in Heegner's paper.\n A strengthening of Hilbert's sixteenth problem asking whether there exists a uniform finite upper bound for the number of limit cycles of planar polynomial vector fields of given degree n. In the 1950s, Evgenii Landis and Ivan Petrovsky published a purported solution, but it was shown wrong in the early 1960s.\n In 1954  K. Zarankiewicz claimed to have solved Turán's brick factory problem about the crossing number of complete bipartite graphs, but Kainen and Ringel later noticed a gap in his proof.\n In 1954 Igor Shafarevich published a proof that every finite solvable group is a Galois group over the rationals. However Schmidt pointed out a gap in the argument at the prime 2, which Shafarevich fixed in 1989.\n Nielsen realization problem. Kravetz claimed to solve this in 1959 by first showing that Teichmuller space is negatively curved, but in 1974 Masur showed that it is not negatively curved. The Nielsen realization problem was finally solved in 1980 by Kerskhoff.\n Yamabe problem. Yamabe claimed  a solution in 1960, but Trudinger discovered a gap in 1968, and a complete proof was not given until 1984.\n In 1961, Jan-Erik Roos published an incorrect theorem about the vanishing of the first derived functor of the inverse limit functor under certain general conditions. However, in 2002, Amnon Neeman constructed a counterexample. Roos  showed in 2006 that the theorem holds if one adds the assumption that the category has a set of generators.\n Mordell conjecture over function fields. Manin published a proof in 1963, but  found and corrected a gap in the proof.\n The Schur multiplier of the Mathieu group M22 is particularly notorious as it was miscalculated more than once:  first claimed it had order 3, then in a 1968 correction claimed it had order 6; its order is in fact (currently believed to be) 12. This caused an error in the title of Janko's paper A new finite simple group of order 86,775,570,046,077,562,880 which possesses M24 and the full covering group of M22 as subgroup on J4: it does not have the full covering group as a subgroup, as the full covering group is larger than was realized at the time.\n The original statement of the classification of N-groups by Thompson in 1968 accidentally omitted the Tits group, though he soon fixed this.\n In 1967 Reinhardt proposed Reinhardt cardinals, which Kunen showed to be inconsistent with ZFC in 1971, though they are not known to be inconsistent with ZF.\n Complex structures on the 6-sphere. In 1969 Alfred Adler published a paper in the American Journal of Mathematics claiming that the 6-sphere has no complex structure. His argument was incomplete, and this is (as of 2016) still a major open problem.\n Per Martin-Löf's original version of intuitionistic type theory proposed in 1971 was shown to be inconsistent by Jean-Yves Girard in 1972, and was replaced by a corrected version.\n In 1973 Britton published a 282-page attempted solution of Burnside's problem. In his proof he assumed the existence of a set of parameters satisfying some inequalities, but Adian pointed out that these inequalities were inconsistent. Novikov and Adian had previously found a correct solution around 1968.\n In 1975, Leitzel, Madan, and Queen incorrectly claimed that there are only 7 function fields over finite fields with genus >0 and class number 1, but in 2013 Stirpe found another; there are in fact exactly 8.\n Closed geodesics. In 1978 Wilhelm Klingenberg published a proof that smooth compact manifolds without boundary have infinitely many closed geodesics. His proof was controversial, and there is currently (as of 2016) no consensus on whether his proof is complete.\n Classification of finite simple groups. In 1983, Gorenstein announced that the proof of the classification had been completed, but he had been misinformed about the status of the proof of classification of quasithin groups, which had a serious gap in it. A complete proof for this case was published by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004.\n Telescope conjecture. Ravenel announced a refutation of this in 1992, but later withdrew it, and the conjecture is still open.\n Kepler conjecture. Hsiang published an incomplete proof of this in 1993. In 1998 Hales published a proof depending on long computer calculations.\n Busemann–Petty problem. Zhang published two papers in the Annals of Mathematics in 1994 and 1999, in the first of which he proved that the Busemann–Petty problem in R4 has a negative solution, and in the second of which he proved that it has a positive solution.\n Algebraic stacks. The book  on algebraic stacks mistakenly claimed that morphisms of algebraic stacks induce morphisms of lisse-étale topoi. The results depending on this were repaired by .\n Matroid bundles. In 2003 Biss published a paper in the Annals of Mathematics claiming to show that matroid bundles are equivalent to real vector bundles, but in 2009 published a correction pointing out a serious gap in the proof.http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1955665/has-anyone-ever-actually-seen-this-daniel-biss-paper His correction was based on 2007 paper by Mnëv.Mnev, N. \"On DK Biss' papers\" The homotopy type of the matroid Grassmannian\" and\" Oriented matroids, complex manifolds, and a combinatorial model for BU\".\" arXiv preprint arXiv:0709.1291 (2007).\n\n is a list over a hundred pages long of (mostly rather trivial) published errors made by mathematicians.\n\nSee also\n\nList of long mathematical proofs\nList of disproved mathematical ideas\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\nDavid Mumford email about the errors of the Italian algebraic geometry school under Severi\nThe first 9 pages of  mention some examples of incorrect results in homotopy theory.\n\nMathOverflow questions\nIlya Nikokoshev, Most interesting mathematics mistake?\nKevin Buzzard what mistakes did the Italian algebraic geometers actually make?\nWill Jagy, Widely accepted mathematical results that were later shown wrong?\nJohn Stillwell, What are some correct results discovered with incorrect (or no) proofs?\nMoritz.

    "title": "Morse–Kelley set theory",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse%E2%80%93Kelley_set_theory",
    "text": "In the foundations of mathematics, Morse–Kelley set theory (MK), Kelley–Morse set theory (KM), Morse–Tarski set theory (MT), Quine–Morse set theory (QM) or the system of Quine and Morse is a first order axiomatic set theory that is closely related to von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG). While von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory restricts the bound variables in the schematic formula appearing in the axiom schema of Class Comprehension to range over sets alone, Morse–Kelley set theory allows these bound variables to range over proper classes as well as sets, as first suggested by Quine in 1940 for his system ML.\n\nMorse–Kelley set theory is named after mathematicians John L. Kelley and Anthony Morse and was first set out by  and later in an appendix to Kelley's textbook General Topology (1955), a graduate level introduction to topology. Kelley said the system in his book was a variant of the systems due to Thoralf Skolem and Morse. Morse's own version appeared later in his book A Theory of Sets (1965).\n\nWhile von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory is a conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC, the canonical set theory) in the sense that a statement in the language of ZFC is provable in NBG if and only if it is provable in ZFC, Morse–Kelley set theory is a proper extension of ZFC. Unlike von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, where the axiom schema of Class Comprehension can be replaced with finitely many of its instances, Morse–Kelley set theory cannot be finitely axiomatized.\n\n MK axioms and ontology \nNBG and MK share a common ontology. The universe of discourse consists of classes. Classes which are members of other classes are called sets. A class which is not a set is a proper class. The primitive atomic sentences involve membership or equality.\n\nWith the exception of Class Comprehension, the following axioms are the same as those for NBG, inessential details aside. The symbolic versions of the axioms employ the following notational devices:\n The upper case letters other than M, appearing in Extensionality, Class Comprehension, and Foundation, denote variables ranging over classes. A lower case letter denotes a variable that cannot be a proper class, because it appears to the left of an ∈. As MK is a one-sorted theory, this notational convention is only mnemonic.\n The monadic predicate  whose intended reading is \"the class x is a set\", abbreviates \n The empty set  is defined by \n The class V, the universal class having all possible sets as members, is defined by  V is also the Von Neumann universe.\n\nExtensionality: Classes having the same members are the same class.\n\nA set and a class having the same extension are identical. Hence MK is not a two-sorted theory, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nFoundation: Each nonempty class A is disjoint from at least one of its members.\n\nClass Comprehension: Let φ(x) be any formula in the language of MK in which x is a free variable and Y is not free. φ(x) may contain parameters which are either sets or proper classes. More consequentially, the quantified variables in φ(x) may range over all classes and not just over all sets; this is the only way MK differs from NBG. Then there exists a class  whose members are exactly those sets x such that  comes out true. Formally, if Y is not free in φ:\n\nPairing: For any sets x and y, there exists a set  whose members are exactly x and y.\n\nPairing licenses the unordered pair in terms of which the ordered pair, , may be defined in the usual way, as . With ordered pairs in hand, Class Comprehension enables defining relations and functions on sets as sets of ordered pairs, making possible the next axiom:\n\nLimitation of Size: C is a proper class if and only if V can be mapped one-to-one into C.\n\nThe formal version of this axiom resembles the axiom schema of replacement, and embodies the class function F. The next section explains how Limitation of Size is stronger than the usual forms of the axiom of choice.\n\nPower set: Let p be a class whose members are all possible subsets of the set a. Then p is a set.\n\nUnion: Let  be the sum class of the set a, namely the union of all members of a. Then s is a set.\n\nInfinity: There exists an inductive set y, meaning that (i) the empty set is a member of y; (ii) if x is a member of y, then so is .\n\nNote that p and s in Power Set and Union are universally, not existentially, quantified, as Class Comprehension suffices to establish the existence of p and s. Power Set and Union only serve to establish that p and s cannot be proper classes.\n\nThe above axioms are shared with other set theories as follows:\n ZFC and NBG: Pairing, Power Set, Union, Infinity;\n NBG (and ZFC, if quantified variables were restricted to sets): Extensionality, Foundation;\n NBG: Limitation of Size.\n\n Discussion \nMonk (1980) and Rubin (1967) are set theory texts built around MK; Rubin's ontology includes urelements. These authors and Mendelson (1997: 287) submit that MK does what is expected of a set theory while being less cumbersome than ZFC and NBG.\n\nMK is strictly stronger than ZFC and its conservative extension NBG, the other well-known set theory with proper classes. In fact, NBG—and hence ZFC—can be proved consistent in MK. MK's strength stems from its axiom schema of Class Comprehension being impredicative, meaning that φ(x) may contain quantified variables ranging over classes. The quantified variables in NBG's axiom schema of Class Comprehension are restricted to sets; hence Class Comprehension in NBG must be predicative. (Separation with respect to sets is still impredicative in NBG, because the quantifiers in φ(x) may range over all sets.) The NBG axiom schema of Class Comprehension can be replaced with finitely many of its instances; this is not possible in MK. MK is consistent relative to ZFC augmented by an axiom asserting the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals.\n\nThe only advantage of the axiom of limitation of size is that it implies the axiom of global choice. Limitation of Size does not appear in Rubin (1967), Monk (1980), or Mendelson (1997). Instead, these authors invoke a usual form of the local axiom of choice, and an \"axiom of replacement,\"See, e.g., Mendelson (1997), p. 239, axiom R. asserting that if the domain of a class function is a set, its range is also a set. Replacement can prove everything that Limitation of Size proves, except prove some form of the axiom of choice.\n\nLimitation of Size plus I being a set (hence the universe is nonempty) renders provable the sethood of the empty set; hence no need for an axiom of empty set. Such an axiom could be added, of course, and minor perturbations of the above axioms would necessitate this addition. The set I is not identified with the limit ordinal  as I could be a set larger than  In this case, the existence of  would follow from either form of Limitation of Size.\n\nThe class of von Neumann ordinals can be well-ordered. It cannot be a set (under pain of paradox); hence that class is a proper class, and all proper classes have the same size as V. Hence V too can be well-ordered.\n\nMK can be confused with second-order ZFC, ZFC with second-order logic (representing second-order objects in set rather than predicate language) as its background logic. The language of second-order ZFC is similar to that of MK (although a set and a class having the same extension can no longer be identified), and their syntactical resources for practical proof are almost identical (and are identical if MK includes the strong form of Limitation of Size). But the semantics of second-order ZFC are quite different from those of MK. For example, if MK is consistent then it has a countable first-order model, while second-order ZFC has no countable models.\n\n Model theory \nZFC, NBG, and MK each have models describable in terms of V, the standard model of ZFC and the von Neumann universe. Let the inaccessible cardinal κ be a member of V. Also let Def(X) denote the Δ0 definable subsets of X (see constructible universe). Then:\n Vκ is an intended model of ZFC;\n Def(Vκ) is an intended model of Mendelson's version of NBG which excludes global choice, replacing limitation of size by replacement and ordinary choice;\n Vκ+1, the power set of Vκ, is an intended model of MK.\n\n History \nMK was first set out in  and popularized in an appendix to J. L. Kelley's (1955) General Topology, using the axioms given in the next section. The system of Anthony Morse's (1965) A Theory of Sets is equivalent to Kelley's, but formulated in an idiosyncratic formal language rather than, as is done here, in standard first order logic.  The first set theory to include impredicative class comprehension was Quine's ML, that built on New Foundations rather than on ZFC.The locus citandum for ML is the 1951 ed. of Quine's Mathematical Logic. However, the summary of ML given in Mendelson (1997), p. 296, is easier to follow. Mendelson's axiom schema ML2 is identical to the above axiom schema of Class Comprehension. Impredicative class comprehension was also proposed in Mostowski (1951) and Lewis (1991).\n\n The axioms in Kelley's General topology \nThe axioms and definitions in this section are, but for a few inessential details, taken from the Appendix to Kelley (1955). The explanatory remarks below are not his. The Appendix states 181 theorems and definitions, and warrants careful reading as an abbreviated exposition of axiomatic set theory by a working mathematician of the first rank. Kelley introduced his axioms gradually, as needed to develop the topics listed after each instance of Develop below.\n\nNotations appearing below and now well-known are not defined. Peculiarities of Kelley's notation include:\n He did not distinguish variables ranging over classes from those ranging over sets;\n domain f and range f denote the domain and range of the function f; this peculiarity has been carefully respected below;\n His primitive logical language includes class abstracts of the form  \"the class of all sets x satisfying A(x).\"\n\nDefinition: x is a set (and hence not a proper class) if, for some y, .\n\nI. Extent: For each x and each y, x=y if and only if for each z,  when and only when \n\nIdentical to Extensionality above. I would be identical to the axiom of extensionality in ZFC, except that the scope of I includes proper classes as well as sets.\n\nII. Classification (schema): An axiom results if in\n For each ,  if and only if  is a set and \n'α' and 'β' are replaced by variables, ' A ' by a formula Æ, and ' B ' by the formula obtained from Æ by replacing each occurrence of the variable which replaced α by the variable which replaced β provided that the variable which replaced β does not appear bound in A.\n\nDevelop: Boolean algebra of sets. Existence of the null class and of the universal class V.\n\nIII. Subsets:  If x is a set, there exists a set y such that for each z, if , then \n\nThe import of III is that of Power Set above. Sketch of the proof of Power Set from III: for any class z which is a subclass of the set x, the class z is a member of the set y whose existence III asserts. Hence z is a set.\n\nDevelop: V is not a set. Existence of singletons. Separation provable.\n\nIV. Union: If x and y are both sets, then  is a set.\n\nThe import of IV is that of Pairing above. Sketch of the proof of Pairing from IV: the singleton  of a set x is a set because it is a subclass of the power set of x (by two applications of III). Then IV implies that  is a set if x and y are sets.\n\nDevelop: Unordered and ordered pairs, relations, functions, domain, range, function composition.\n\nV. Substitution: If f is a [class] function and domain f is a set, then range f is a set.\n\nThe import of V is that of the axiom schema of replacement in NBG and ZFC.\n\nVI. Amalgamation: If x is a set, then  is a set.\n\nThe import of VI is that of Union above. IV and VI may be combined into one axiom.Kelley (1955), p. 261, fn †.\n\nDevelop: Cartesian product, injection, surjection, bijection, order theory.\n\nVII. Regularity: If  there is a member y of x such that \n\nThe import of VII is that of Foundation above.\n\nDevelop: Ordinal numbers, transfinite induction.\n\nVIII. Infinity: There exists a set y, such that  and  whenever \n\nThis axiom, or equivalents thereto, are included in ZFC and NBG. VIII asserts the unconditional existence of two sets, the infinite inductive set y, and the null set   is a set simply because it is a member of y. Up to this point, everything that has been proved to exist is a class, and Kelley's discussion of sets was entirely hypothetical.\n\nDevelop:  Natural numbers, N is a set, Peano axioms, integers, rational numbers, real numbers.\n\nDefinition: c is a choice function if c is a function and  for each member x of domain c.\n\nIX. Choice: There exists a choice function c whose domain is .\n\nIX is very similar to the axiom of global choice derivable from Limitation of Size above.\n\nDevelop: Equivalents of the axiom of choice. As is the case with ZFC, the development of the cardinal numbers requires some form of Choice.\n\nIf the scope of all quantified variables in the above axioms is restricted to sets, all axioms except III and the schema IV are ZFC axioms. IV is provable in ZFC. Hence the Kelley treatment of MK makes very clear that all that distinguishes MK from ZFC are variables ranging over proper classes as well as sets, and the Classification schema.\n\nNotes\n\n References \n John L.

    "text": "The Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus () is a Roman Catholic dynastic order of knighthood bestowed by the House of Savoy, founded in 1572 by Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, through amalgamation approved by Pope Gregory XIII of the Order of Saint Maurice, founded in 1434, with the medieval Order of Saint Lazarus, founded circa 1119, considered its sole legitimate successor. The Grand Master is Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, since 1983.\n\nThe order was formerly awarded by the Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946) with the heads of the House of Savoy as the Kings of Italy. Originally a chivalric order of noble nature, it was restricted to subjects of noble families with proofs of at least eight noble great-grandparents. The order's military and noble nature was and is still combined with a Roman Catholic character.\n\nAfter the abolition of the monarchy and the foundation of the Italian Republic in 1946, the legacy of the order is maintained by the pretenders of the House of Savoy and the Italian throne in exile.\n\nThe order is estimated to include about 2,000 members around the world.\n\n History \nthumb|150px|Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy (1528–1580), founder and first Grand Master of the amalgated Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus in recognition by Pope Gregory XIII.\n\nBoth crosses from its two forerunners still exist in the insignia of their subsequent successor, today's Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, founded by amalgation in 1572.\n\n Order of Saint Lazarus (1119) \n\nThe Order of Saint Lazarus, founded c. 1119, can be traced to the establishment around 1100, of a hospital for leprosy in Jerusalem, Kingdom of Jerusalem, by a group of crusaders who called themselves \"Brothers of Saint Lazarus\". From its inception, the order was concerned with the relief of leprosy, and many of its members were lepers who had been knights in other orders. It became rich, its practices dubious, and its funds eventually abused. With the fall of Acre in 1291, the Knights of Saint Lazarus emigrated from the Holy Land and Egypt and settled in France and, in 1311, in Naples. In the 16th century, the order declined in credibility and wealth. With papal support, the Duke of Savoy became Grand Master in 1572. Before its transfer to the House of Savoy, the Order of Saint Lazarus maintained a number of leper hospitals, including an institution in the Italian city of Capua.\n\n Order of Saint Maurice (1434) \n\nThe Order of Saint Maurice was established in 1434 by Amedeo VIII of Savoy, during his stay in the Ripaglia hermitage near Thonon, named after Saint Maurice of the Theban Legion. From its beginning, it was a military order. The order declined, but in 1572 was reestablished by Pope Pius V at the instigation of the then-Duke of Savoy.\n\n Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (1572) \nthumb|left|150px|King and Grand Master Charles Felix of Sardinia in ceremonial robe of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.\nthumb|150px|King Charles Albert of Sardinia in ceremonial robe.\n\nIn 1572, Pope Gregory XIII united the Order of Saint Lazarus in perpetuity with the Crown of Savoy. Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, merged it with the Savoyan Order of Saint Maurice, and thenceforth the title of Grand Master of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus was hereditary in that house. The pope gave him authority over the vacant commanderies everywhere, except in the states of the King of Spain, which included the greater part of Italy. In England and Germany, these commanderies were suppressed by the Protestant reformation.\n\nThe new organisation was charged to defend the Holy See as well as continue to assist lepers. The war galleys of the order fought against the Ottoman Empire and the Barbary pirates. When leprosy again broke out, the order founded a hospital in Aosta in 1773.\n\n Kingdom Italy (1861–1946) \nthumb|150px|King and Grand Master Umberto II of Italy visiting Cairo, Egypt.\n\nWith the Italian unification (1860-1871), the order became a de facto Italian state order for military and civilian merits, consisting of five classes: Knight Grand Cross, Knight Grand Officer, Knight Commander, Knight Officer and Knight.\n\nThe formerly related Maurician medal for Military Merit of fifty years, established in 1839, was one of the few medals not suppressed by the Italian republic, becoming the Maurician medal of Merit for 50 years military career in 1954.Established by Royal Magistral Patent dated 19 July 1839, approved by Royal Decree of 21 December 1924 and renewed by Law No. 203(1) of 7 March 1954 Medaglia Mauriziana al Merito di dieci lustri di carriera militare, published in Gazzetta Ufficiale, No. 116, 21 May 1954, as amended by Law No. 1327 of 8 November 1956\n\nBrought back in favour by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, the order was sparingly conferred for distinguished service in military and civilian affairs as an exclusive award compared with the more common Order of the Crown of Italy.\n\n Dynastic chivalric order bestowed in exile (1946-) \nAfter Italy became a republic in 1946, the order was effectively replaced by the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. Since 1951 it has not been officially recognised by the Italian state.\n\n Organisation \nthumb|left|100px|Great coat of arms of the royal family of Italy, including the insignia of the order.\nthumb|150px|Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples (right), and his third cousin Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta (b. 1943) (left).\nthumb|left|100px|Insignia of the grades.\nthumb|left|100px|Insignia of the order.\nthumb|left|100px|Insignia of a Commander of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.\nthumb|Basilica Mauriziana in Turin, Italy, associated with the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.\nThe House of Savoy in exile continues to bestow the order on recipients eminent in the public service, science, art, letters, trade, and charitable works. While the continued use of those decorations conferred prior to 1951 is permitted in Italy, the crowns on the ribbons issued before 1946 must be substituted for as many five pointed stars on military uniforms.Ordini Cavallereschi del Regno d'Italia  Corpo della Nobiltà Italiana (retrieved 10 September 2009) Eventually, it became a requirement for a person to have already received the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus before receiving the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation.\n\nThe generally accepted Grand Master of the order is Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, the current head of the House of Savoy. However, some of Vittorio Emanule's policies as Grand Master have generated controversy.\n\nIn 2006, Vittorio Emanuele's third cousin, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta (b. 1943), declared himself head of the Savoy dynasty and thus Sovereign de jure. For this reason, the grand magistry is now contested.\n\n Grades \nKnight Grand Cordon, Special Class, For the Grand Master of the Order; who wear a sash on the right shoulder to the left hip, the badge as well as star which is worn on the left side of the stomach are in Brilliants\nKnight/Dame Grand Cordon, Wear a sash on the right shoulder to the left hip and the badge as well as star are worn on the left side\nKnight/Dame Grand Officer, who wear a necklet plus the star on the left chest; (ladies in: uniform = necklet with the star on the left side of the stomach, daydress = bow formed necklet worn on the left side of the chest with out the star, evening wear = bow formed necklet worn on the left side of the chest with the star on the left chest)\nKnight/Dame Commander, who wear a necklet; (ladies in: uniform = necklet, daydress = bow formed necklet worn on the left side of the chest, evening wear = bow formed necklet worn on the left side of the chest)\nKnight/Dame Officer, who wear a medal in Gold on the left side of the chest; (ladies in: uniform = necklet, daydress and evening wear = bow formed medal worn on the left side of the chest)\nKnight/Dame, who wear a smaller Medal in Silver on the left side of the chest; (ladies in: uniform = necklet; daydress and evening wear = bow formed medal worn on the left side of the chest)\n\n Insignia \n\nThe badge of the order is in gilt, consists of a white-enameled cross bottony of the Order of Saint Maurice, with a green-enameled Maltese Cross, the Cross of the Order of Saint Lazarus, placed in saltire between the arms of the cross botonny.

    "text": "+ Minor planets discovered: 685  see \n\nPaul G. Comba (1926 - April 5, 2017) was an Italian-American computer scientist, an amateur astronomer and a prolific discoverer of minor planets.\n\nHe was born in Tunisia to Italian parents in 1926, and moved to Italy at a young age.  Admitted to university studies at the age of 17, He attended the University of Turin (1943–46). In 1946 he moved to the United States to attend Bluffton College, from which he graduated in 1947.  He then attended Caltech, and completed his Ph.D. work in mathematics in 1951 (the degree was conferred at commencement in 1952). In 1951 he moved to Honolulu where he taught at the University of Hawaii until 1960.\n\nHe then joined IBM as a software developer, and later as a member of the IBM Cambridge Scientific Center. There he worked in Cryptography, and also developed a multiplication algorithm for large numbers, which reduces the multiplication time to as little as 3% of the conventional algorithm.  \n\nIn 2003 he won the Leslie C. Peltier Award for his contribution to astronomy.\n\nHe is the author of the Astronomical League's Asteroid Club Observing Guide, and was an active member of the Prescott Astronomy Club.\n\nPrescott Observatory\n\nAfter retirement in 1991, Comba moved to Prescott, Arizona, where he built the Prescott Observatory (obs. code: 684)  There he specialized in discovering asteroids and has been recognized for the discovery of 644 numbered objects as of September 2013.\n\nRefurbished in 2011, the observatory houses a PlaneWave CDK 24 inch telescope with two Takahashi wide field refractors in the dome. There is a dedicated solar observatory that is equipped with a Lunt 152 solar telescope. The observatory also has a nano lab for cosmology research that is currently equipped with a JEOL 5800LV SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). Prescott Observatory is an active contributor for the webcast organization SLOOH which is the premiere webcast organization for live celestial events. The observatory is now owned and operated by Matt Francis.\n\n List of discovered minor planets \n\n 7684 Marioferrero  3 March 1997  8223 Bradshaw  6 August 1996  8224 Fultonwright  6 August 1996

    "text": "Peter John Olivi, also Pierre de Jean Olivi or Petrus Joannis Olivi (1248 – March 14, 1298), was a Franciscan theologian who, although he died professing the faith of the Roman Catholic Church, became a controversial figure in the arguments surrounding poverty at the beginning of the 14th century.  In large part, this was due to his view that the Franciscan vow of poverty also entailed usus pauper (i.e., 'poor' or 'restricted' use of goods); while contemporary Franciscans generally agreed that usus pauper was important to the Franciscan way of life, they disagreed that it was part of their vow of poverty.  His support of the extreme view of ecclesiastical poverty played a part in the ideology of the groups coming to be known as the Spiritual Franciscans or Fraticelli.\n\nBiography\nA Franciscan and theological author, born at Sérignan, Diocese of Béziers, 1247–48. At twelve he entered the Friars Minor at Béziers, and later studied at Paris. He was already present there in 1268, when Bonaventure gave his Collationes de septem donis Spiritus sancti, and was probably still there in 1273, at the Collationes in Hexaemeron. Returning to his native province, he taught in different places, and was probably in Narbonne around 1277–79.\n \nDuring the preparation of Nicholas III's Bull Exiit qui seminat, in the summer of 1279, Olivi accompanied his provincial minister to Italy, but was not himself part of the commission that work on the Bull. He was asked to express briefly his opinion with regard to Franciscan poverty, but composed much longer questions on the evangelical perfection. Upon his return to Languedoc, he was promoted as biblical lecturer at Montpellier and produce a number of major biblical commentaries (on Matthew, Isaiah, Genesis, Job and John). One opponent (described as \"brother Ar.\", to be identified with Arnaud Gaillard, then a formed bachelor back from Paris) voiced his opposition to Olivi's views on the vow, which prompted him to write a Treatise on poor use (De usu paupere). The controversy between the two young theologians raged on many different issues, which attracted the attention of the General Chapter of Strasburg in 1282. Although we know only of Olivi's fate, both were probably suspended from teaching. His doctrine was examined by seven franciscans theologians at Paris, who first drew a list of errors (Littera septem sigillorum) and then substantiated it by a roll of extracts (rotulus).\n \nOlivi defended himself in several responses (1283–85), and finally the General Chapter of Montpellier (1287) decided in his favour. The new general superior, Matthew of Aquasparta, sent him as lector in theology to the convent of Santa Croce in Florence, whence Matthew's successor, Raymond Gaufredi, sent him as lector to Montpellier. At the General Chapter of Paris in 1292 Olivi again gave explanations, which were apparently satisfactory. He spent his last years in the convent of Narbonne and died, surrounded by his friends, after an earnest profession of his Catholic Faith (published by Wadding ad a. 1297, n. 33) on 14 March 1298.\n\nOlivi's work On Sale, Purchase, Usury and Restitution, or more simply On Contracts (as in the latest edition by S. Piron, 2012), contains a subtle discussion of the pricing of risks and probabilities in connection with valuing compensation due for compulsory requisitioning of property.J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal, (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 265-267.\n\nLegacy and controversy\nPeace was not obtained by his death. His friends, friars and seculars, showed an exaggerated veneration for their leader, and honoured his tomb as that of a saint; on the other hand the General Chapter of Lyon in 1299 ordered his writings to be collected and burnt as heretical.\n \nThe General Council of Vienne in 1312 established, in the Decretal \"Fidei catholicæ fundamento\" (Bull. Franc., V, 86), the Catholic doctrine against three points of Olivi's teaching, without mentioning the author; these points referred to the moment Christ's body was transfixed by the lance, the manner in which the soul is united to the body and the baptism of infants.\nIn 1318 the friars of his order went so far as to destroy Olivi's tomb, a desecration, and in the next year two further steps were taken against him: his writings were absolutely forbidden by the General Chapter of Marseilles, and a special commission of theologians examined Olivi's \"Postilla in Apocalypsim\" and marked out sixty sentences, chiefly joachimistical extravagances (see Joachim of Flora. For text see Baluzius-Mansi, \"Miscellanea\", II, Lucca, 1761, 258–70; cf. also Denifle, \"Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis\", II, i, Paris, 1891, 238–9) . It was only in 1326 that those sentences were really condemned by John XXII, when the fact that Emperor Louis IV the Bavarian used Olivi's writings in his famous Appeal of Sachsenhausen in 1324 had again drawn attention to the author.\nThough Olivi was never official condemned as a heretic his name included as a banned author in several editions of the Index of Prohibited Books.   \nFather Ehrle considers (Archiv, III, 440) that Olivi was not the impious heretic he is painted in some writings of the Middle Ages, and states (ibid., 448) that the denunciation of his theological doctrine was rather a tactical measure of the adversaries of the severe principles of poverty and reform professed by Olivi. For the rest, Olivi follows in many points the doctrine of St. Bonaventure.\n\nWritings\nThe numerous works of Olivi, now edited for the most, can be divided into five classes:\n\n1.

    "text": "A scientific society, the Quaternion Society was an \"International Association for Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics\". At its peak it consisted of about 60 mathematicians spread throughout the academic world that were experimenting with quaternions and other hypercomplex number systems. The guiding light was Alexander Macfarlane who served as its Secretary initially, and became President in 1909. The Association published a Bibliography in 1904 and a Bulletin (annual report) from 1900 to 1913.\n\nThe Bulletin became a review journal for topics in vector analysis and abstract algebra such as the theory of equipollence. The mathematical work reviewed pertained largely to matrices and linear algebra as the methods were in rapid development at the time.\nGenesis\nIn 1895, Professor P. Molenbroek of The Hague, Holland, and Shinkichi Kimura studying at Yale put out a call for scholars to form the society in widely circulated journals: Nature,S. Kimura & P. Molenbroek (1895) Friends and Fellow Workers in Quaternions Nature 52:545–6 (#1353) Science,S. Kimura & P. Molenbroek (1895) To those Interested in Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics Science 2nd Ser, 2:524–25 and the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.\"Notes\" Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 2:53, 182; 5:317 Giuseppe Peano also announced the society formation in his Rivista di Matematica. \n\nThe call to form an Association was encouraged by Macfarlane in 1896:\nThe logical harmony and unification of the whole of mathematical analysis ought to be kept in view. The algebra of space ought to include the algebra of the plane as a special case, just as the algebra of the plane includes the algebra of the line…When vector analysis is developed and presented...we may expect to see many zealous cultivators, many fruitful applications, and, finally, universal diffusion...May the movement initiated by Messrs. Molenbroek and Kimura hasten the realization of this happy result.A. Macfarlane (1896) Quaternions Science (2) 3:99–100, link from Jstor early content\n\nIn 1897 the British Association met in Toronto where vector products were discussed:\nProfessor Henrici proposed a new notation to denote the different products of vectors, which consists in using square brackets for vector products and round brackets for scalar products. He likewise advocated adoption of Heaviside’s term \"ort\" for vector, the tensor of which is the number 1. Prof. A. Macfarlane read a communication on the solution of the cubic equation in which he explained how the two binomials in Cardano’s formula may be treated as complex quantities, either circular or hyperbolic, all the roots of the cubic can then be deduced by a general method.\"Physics at the British Association\"  Nature 56:461,2 (# 1454)\n\nA system of national secretaries was announced in the AMS Bulletin in 1899: Alexander McAulay for Australasia, Victor Schlegel for Germany, Joly for Great Britain and Ireland, Giuseppe Peano for Italy, Kimura for Japan, Aleksandr Kotelnikov for Russia, F. Kraft for Switzerland, and Arthur Stafford Hathaway for the USA. For France the national secretary was Paul Genty, an engineer with the division of Ponts et Chaussees, and a quaternion collaborator with Charles-Ange Laisant, author of Methode des Quaterniones (1881).\n\nVictor Schlegel reportedVictor Schlegel (1899) \"Internationaler Verein zur Beförderung des Studiums der Quaternionen und verwandter Systeme der Mathematik\", Monatshefte für Mathematik 10(1):376 on the new institution in the Monatshefte für Mathematik.\n\nOfficers\nWhen the Society was organized in 1899, Peter Guthrie Tait was chosen as president, but he declined for reasons of poor health.\n\nThe first President was Robert Stawell Ball and Alexander Macfarlane served as Secretary and Treasurer. In 1905 Charles Jasper Joly took over as President and L. van Elfrinkhof as Treasurer while Macfarlane continued as Secretary. In 1909 Macfarlane became President, James Byrnie Shaw became Secretary, and van Elfrinkhof continued as Treasurer. The next year Macfarlane and Shaw continued in their posts while Macfarlane also absorbed the office of Treasurer. When Macfarlane died in 1913 after nearly completing the issue of the Bulletin, Shaw completed it and wound up the Association.\n\nThe rules state that the President had the power of veto.\n\nBulletin\nThe Bulletin of the Association Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics was issued nine times under the editorship of Alexander Macfarlane. Every issue listed the officers of the Association, governing council, rules, members, and a financial statement from the treasurer. Today HathiTrust provides access to these publications that are mainly of historical interest:\nP.R. Girard (1984) \"The Quaternion Group and Modern Physics\", European Journal of Physics 5:25–32M.

The publication set a professional standard; for instance the Manual of Quaternions (1905) of Joly has no bibliography beyond citation of Macfarlane.\nFurthermore, in 1967 when M.J. Crowe published A History of Vector Analysis, he wrote in the preface (page ix) :\nConcerning bibliography. No formal bibliographical section has been included with this book. ... the need for a bibliography is greatly diminished by the existence of a book that lists nearly all relevant primary documents published to about 1912, this is Alexander Macfarlane’s Bibliography ...\n\nEvery year more papers and books appeared that were of interest to Association members so it was necessary to update the Bibliography with supplements in the Bulletin. The categories used to group the items in the supplements give a sense of the changing focus of the Association:\n 1905 Supplement\n 1908 Supplement: Matrices, Linear substitutions, Quadratic forms, Bilinear forms, Complex numbers, Equipollences, Vector analysis, Commutative algebras, Quaternions, Biquaternions, Linear associative algebras, General algebra and operations, Additional.\n 1909 Supplement\n 1910 Supplement: Matrices, Linear groups, Complex numbers & equipollences, Vector analysis, Ausdehnungslehre, Quaternions, Linear associative algebras.\n 1912 Supplement: Equipollences, Commutative systems, Space-analysis, Dyadic systems, Vector analysis, Quaternions.\n 1913 Supplement: Commutative systems, Space analysis, Dyadic systems, Vector analysis, Other, Quaternions, Hypercomplex numbers, General algebra.\n\nAftermath\n\nIn 1913 Macfarlane died, and as related by Dirk Struik, the Society \"became a victim of the first World War\".Dirk Struik (1967) A Concise History of Mathematics, 3rd edition, page 172, Dover Books\n\nJames Byrnie Shaw, the surviving officer, wrote 50 book notices for American mathematical publications.See author=Shaw, James Byrnie at Mathematical Reviews\nThe final article review in the Bulletin was The Wilson and Lewis Algebra of Four-Dimensional Space written by J. B. Shaw. He summarizes,\nThis algebra is applied to the representation of the Minkowski time-space world.  It enables all analytical work to be with reals, although the geometry becomes non-Euclidean.\nThe article reviewed was \"The space-time manifold of relativity, the non-euclidean geometry of mechanics, and electromagnetics\".E. B. Wilson & G. N. Lewis (1912) Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 48: 389–507\nHowever, when the textbook The Theory of Relativity by Ludwik Silberstein in 1914 was made available as an English understanding of Minkowski space, the algebra of biquaternions was applied, but without references to the British background or Macfarlane or other quaternionists of the Society. The language of quaternions had become international, providing content to set theory and expanded mathematical notation, and expressing mathematical physics.\n\nSee also\n Formulario mathematico\n Hypercomplex number\n Hyperbolic quaternion\n Non-Euclidean geometry\n\nNotes and references\n\nCategory:Mathematical societies\nCategory:Historical treatment of quaternions\nCategory:History of mathematics"

    "title": "ST type theory",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST_type_theory",
    "text": "The following system is Mendelson's (1997, 289–293) ST type theory. \nST is equivalent with Russell's ramified theory plus the Axiom of reducibility. \nThe domain of quantification is partitioned into an ascending hierarchy of types, with all individuals assigned a type. Quantified variables range over only one type; hence the underlying logic is first-order logic. ST is \"simple\" (relative to the type theory of Principia Mathematica) primarily because all members of the domain and codomain of any relation must be of the same type.\nThere is a lowest type, whose individuals have no members and are members of the second lowest type. Individuals of the lowest type correspond to the urelements of certain set theories. Each type has a next higher type, analogous to the notion of successor in Peano arithmetic. While ST is silent as to whether there is a maximal type, a transfinite number of types poses no difficulty. These facts, reminiscent of the Peano axioms, make it convenient and conventional to assign a natural number to each type, starting with 0 for the lowest type. But type theory does not require a prior definition of the naturals.\n\nThe symbols peculiar to ST are primed variables and infix . In any given formula, unprimed variables all have the same type, while primed variables () range over the next higher type. The atomic formulas of ST are of two forms,  (identity) and . The infix symbol  suggests the intended interpretation, set membership.\n\nAll variables appearing in the definition of identity and in the axioms Extensionality and Comprehension, range over individuals of one of two consecutive types. Only unprimed variables (ranging over the \"lower\" type) can appear to the left of '', whereas to its right, only primed variables (ranging over the \"higher\" type) can appear. The first-order formulation of ST rules out quantifying over types. Hence each pair of consecutive types requires its own axiom of Extensionality and of Comprehension, which is possible if Extensionality and Comprehension below are taken as axiom schemata \"ranging over\" types.\n\n Identity, defined by .\n Extensionality.  An axiom schema. .\n\nLet  denote any first-order formula containing the free variable .\n\n Comprehension.  An axiom schema. .\n\n Remark. Any collection of elements of the same type may form an object of the next higher type. Comprehension is schematic with respect to  as well as to types.\n\n Infinity.  There exists a nonempty binary relation  over the individuals of the lowest type, that is irreflexive, transitive, and strongly connected:  and with codomain contained in domain.\n\n Remark. Infinity is the only true axiom of ST and is entirely mathematical in nature. It asserts that  is a strict total order, with a codomain contained in its domain. If 0 is assigned to the lowest type, the type of  is 3. Infinity can be satisfied only if the (co)domain of  is infinite, thus forcing the existence of an infinite set. If relations are defined in terms of ordered pairs, this axiom requires a prior definition of ordered pair; the Kuratowski definition, adapted to ST, will do. The literature does not explain why the usual axiom of infinity (there exists an inductive set) of ZFC of other set theories could not be married to ST.\n\nST reveals how type theory can be made very similar to axiomatic set theory. Moreover, the more elaborate ontology of ST, grounded in what is now called the \"iterative conception of set,\" makes for axiom (schemata) that are far simpler than those of conventional set theories, such as ZFC, with simpler ontologies. Set theories whose point of departure is type theory, but whose axioms, ontology, and terminology differ from the above, include New Foundations and Scott–Potter set theory.\n\n Formulations based on equality \n\nChurch's type theory has been extensively studied by two of Church's students, Leon Henkin and Peter B. Andrews. Since ST is a higher order logic, and in higher order logics one can define propositional connectives in terms of logical equivalence and quantifiers, in 1963 Henkin developed a formulation of ST based on equality, but in which he restricted attention to propositional types. This was simplified later that year by Andrews in his\ntheory Q0.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Church's Type Theory\" – by Peter Andrews (adapted from his book). In this respect ST can be seen as a particular kind of a higher-order logic, classified by P.T. Johnstone in Sketches of an Elephant, as having a lambda-signature, that is a higher-order signature that contains no relations, and uses only products and arrows (function types) as type constructors. Furthermore, as Johnstone put it, ST is \"logic-free\" in the sense that it contains no logical connectives or quantifiers in its formulae.P.T. Johnstone, Sketches of an elephant, p. 952\n\nSee also\n type theory\n\nReferences\n\nMendelson, Elliot, 1997. Introduction to Mathematical Logic, 4th ed. Chapman & Hall.\nW.

    "text": "Shea Zellweger (born September 7, 1925 in Chicago, Illinois, USA) served as Chair of the Psychology Department at the University of Mount Union from 1969 to 1992. Zellweger’s lifetime achievements and academic contributions to education continue to be significant.  He received his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology at Temple University in 1966.  His doctoral dissertation focused on early visual stimulation experience and its later effects on discrimination learning.  Zellweger is probably best known for his creation of a simpler and more mentally intuitive system of logic notation called the Logic Alphabet.X-stem Logic Alphabet  The Logic Alphabet, also known as the X-stem Logic Alphabet (XLA), is a notation system that contains a unique and visually iconographic approach to learning and performing logic operations.  Patents have been issued on its design in the United States, Canada and Japan.\n\nBackground\n\nthumb|275px|Zellweger's X-stem Logic Alphabet (XLA) shape value notation for the 16 binary logical connectives. The count of the iconographic letter shapes, 8 odd-stem (– 4 – 4 –) and 8 even-stem (1 – 6 – 1), corresponds to the fifth row of Pascal's Triangle (1 4 6 4 1).

(Click Image to Enlarge) Zellweger’s background is a combination of formal education and extensive research in the fields of Psychology, Pedagogy, Semiotics and Logic.  In 1949, Zellweger attended a summer seminar at the Institute of General Semantics with Alfred Korzybski.  In 1949–52, still in the era of Robert M. Hutchins and the Great Books Program, he earned his undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago.  In 1975–76, he spent a year at the Biological Computer Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, under the direction of Heinz von Foerster.  In 1982, while on sabbatical leave at the  Peirce Edition Project, in Indianapolis (IUPUI), he examined and carefully reordered a 900 page section of manuscripts written by Charles Sanders Peirce entitled “The Simplest Mathematics” (1902).  In 1989, he served the Peirce Edition Project again when he added to the proper sequencing of specific sections of Peirce’s extensive manuscripts.  These multidisciplinary experiences contributed to the development, over a forty year period, of his X-stem Logic Alphabet. Zellweger has been a respected academic speaker and author, especially in the fields of Semiotics and Education.thumb|275px|Zellweger's evolution of a logic truth table into a four quadrant truth matrix. (Click Image to Enlarge)\n\nPublications\nthumb|275px|Geometric structures and symmetry relations revealed by XLA in one to four spatial dimensions. (Click Image to Enlarge)\nZellweger’s publications, as well as his unpublished materials, are extensive.Publications list  A general principle expressed throughout his writings is the need for conscious and deliberate efforts that focus on the sign design and sign engineering of any and all kinds of notation (e.g. natural language and its specialized systems of logical, mathematical, chemical and musical notation).  Moreover, his publications primarily center on the formal language of logic and improving the structure of its symbols.  Specifically, he focuses on the deliberate engineering of a constructed language for logic called the X-stem Logic Alphabet (XLA).  He emphasizes, with the mounting global prevalence of computers or “logic machines”, the importance of adopting a higher standard for the way we write and communicate logic.  He brings to light the importance of a carefully constructed user-friendly notation that would allow students, at earlier stages of cognitive development, to learn and incorporate the fundamental skills of logic.  He further highlights the importance of purposely designing our symbols of notation to be as cognitively ergonomic as possible, while simultaneously possessing multiple layers of rich content.  The fundamental and applied principles of semiotic engineering are exemplified throughout his publications.\n\nContribution\n\nZellweger’s contribution to the field of logic is best demonstrated through his development of the X-stem Logic Alphabet (XLA). The XLA notation is a highly advanced extension of both Charles Sanders Peirce’s box-X notation (1902) and Warren Sturgis McCulloch’s dot-X notation (1942).  It could be said that XLA (1961–62) is the evolutionary product of the comprehensive work of Peirce, McCulloch, and Zellweger, or PMZ as an acronym.  The standard notation used today (dot Logical conjunction, vee Logical disjunction, horseshoe Material conditional  representing and, or, if) is a lingering, overly abstract, unsystematically selected set of symbols that was primarily developed and used by Peano, Whitehead, and Russell, or by common acronym PWR.  This already exposes the primary weakness.  Dot, vee, horseshoe do not carry any information that identifies, specifies, and encodes the truth tables they represent, namely, TFFF, TTTF, and TFTT.  In marked contrast, XLA is an intentionally engineered set of sixteen iconographic letter shape symbols specifically designed to improve the efficiency of learning and performing logical operations.  Serving as a system of highly abbreviated mini truth tables, Zellweger’s claim is that XLA is not only much easier to learn.  It is also much easier to use.  In fact, when ten-base numerals are used without the abacus and when XLA is used without written laid out rows and columns of truth tables, ordinary operations in both notations are easier to perform during the act of computational writing.\n\nIt can be said that the current PWR symbols are to logic what Roman Numerals are to arithmetic. Roman Numerals (I, II, III) were cumbersome to use and only maintained a dominant role in arithmetic until 1202, when Leonardo Fibonacci in his work Liber Abaci, demonstrated that calculations with Hindu-Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) were far more efficient.  The lack of mental and written efficiency in the use of traditional PWR symbols may be because they are not icons.  Therefore, these extremely abstract symbols cannot in writing visually depict the truth tables themselves, the simple geometric forms, the notational symmetry relations, and the isomorphic sets of interrelations inherent in logic.  Conversely, the XLA symbols are iconographic and they possess a shape value.  This enables complex logical operations to be performed through easy flips and rotations of the letter shape symbols themselves.\n\nBy design, the letter shape of each X-stem Logic Alphabet symbol visually embodies and displays its individual underlying logic truth table.  In other words, after the simple and exact truth table code in the deep structure of XLA has been learned, operations performed on the letter shape symbols are equivalent to logical operations acting on highly abbreviated sets of mini truth tables.  Consequently, those using XLA never have the need to interrupt their calculations to check rows and columns of laid out truth tables.  This basic and central advantage of XLA over PWR is often not fully recognized, even by practiced logicians.  Nonetheless, systems of notation evolve and improve over time (e.g. Roman Numerals to the Decimal System and Imperial Units to the Metric System).\n\nIn brief, XLA is described in two steps: (1) give the 16 binary connectives the right geometry, the right shape value anatomy; and (2) add the transformational physiology, namely, apply the algebra of simple symmetry groups to the 16 iconic letter shape symbols.  Change comes with a whisper.  This whisper presents a triple isomorphism.  The mental operations are the same as the symmetry operations are the same as the logical operations.  Said the other way around, the logical operations are the same as the symmetry operations are the same as the mental operations.  Said again in a different order, the logical operations are the same as the mental operations are the same as the symmetry operations.  Here we have a prime example of cognitive ergonomics at its best.  The single act of performing any one automatically performs the other two.\n\nWhether or not the (PMZ) (XLA) system, or something similar to it, replaces the traditional PWR symbols remains to be seen.  Nonetheless, for researchers and semioticians, Zellweger's contributions to logic notation will most likely play a valuable role in future developments.\n\nTeaching\n\nZellweger’s teaching system, for logic, integrates the developmental and interactive approaches of Fröbel, Montessori, and Piaget.  This is accomplished through the use of educational tools and models that predominantly focus on visual and kinesthetic learning modalities.  At every level in the educational ladder, students of Zellweger’s system learn in a natural and intuitive way through the use of sensory-motor exercises and a variety of interactive geometric models. (See video of Zellweger’s teaching models at the Museum of Jurassic Technology:)  These models, at the most advanced level, become extremely complex and beautiful.\n\nEach X-stem Logic Alphabet symbol can be easily flipped or rotated, by eye-hand coordination, through a series of simple symmetry transformations.  When a student can visually and manually observe the geometry and the network of symmetry relationships among all 16 binary connectives of two-valued logic, it then becomes far easier for them to perform what are normally considered to be highly abstract logical operations.  Zellweger’s publications and models permit students to literally “see”, “touch”, “play with”, “work with”, and “think about” the natural beauty of logic.  His work is now on display at the Museum of Jurassic Technology, Culver City, California.

His thesis La vita delle forme letterarie (The life of literary forms) was published in 1892 in Turin. Pastore then turned to philosophy, influenced by the works of Pasquale d'Ercole, Friedrich Kiesow, Antonio Garbasso, and Giuseppe Peano, publishing his own thesis Sopra le teorie della scienza: logica, matematica, fisica (On the theories of science: logic, mathematics, physics) in 1903.\n\nHe was professor in Turin from 1913 until 1939, leading a laboratory of \"experimental logic\". He eventually focused on logical aspects and procedures in science.\n\nPastore died in Turin.\n\n Works \n , 1903\n , 1906\n Del nuovo spirito della scienza e della filosofia, 1907\n Sillogismo e proporzione, 1910\n Dell'essere e del conoscere, 1911\n Il pensiero puro, 1913\n Il problema della causalitá, con particolare riguardo alla teoria del metodo sperimentale, 1921\n Il solipsismo, 1923\n La logica del potenziamento, 1936\n Logica sperimentale, 1939\n L'acrisia di Kant, 1940\n La filosofia di Lenin, 1946\n La volontá dell'assurdo.
