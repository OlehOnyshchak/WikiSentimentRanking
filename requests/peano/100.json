They used hieroglyphs for the digits and were not positional. By 1770\u00a0BC, the Egyptians had a symbol for zero in accounting texts. The symbol nfr, meaning beautiful, was also used to indicate the base level in drawings of tombs and pyramids and distances were measured relative to the base line as being above or below this line.\n\nBy the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, the Babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated sexagesimal positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a space between sexagesimal numerals. By 300\u00a0BC, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted as a placeholder in the same Babylonian system. In a tablet unearthed at Kish (dating from about 700\u00a0BC), the scribe B\u00eal-b\u00e2n-aplu wrote his zeros with three hooks, rather than two slanted wedges.Kaplan, Robert. (2000). The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero. Oxford: Oxford University Press.\n\nThe Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone. Nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2\u00d760), 3 and 180 (3\u00d760), 4 and 240 (4\u00d760), looked the same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. Only context could differentiate them.\n\nPre-Columbian Americas\nthumb|upright|alt=illustration of a fractured inscribed stone with pre-Columbian glyphs and icons|The back of Epi-Olmec stela C from Tres Zapotes, the second oldest Long Count date discovered. The numerals 7.16.6.16.18 translate to September, 32\u00a0BC (Julian). The glyphs surrounding the date are thought to be one of the few surviving examples of Epi-Olmec script.\nThe Mesoamerican Long Count calendar developed in south-central Mexico and Central America required the use of zero as a place-holder within its vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. Many different glyphs, including this partial quatrefoil\u2014alt=small illustration of a partial quatrefoil in right half, whitespace in left half\u2014were used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the earliest of which (on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas) has a date of 36\u00a0BC.\n\nSince the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the Maya homeland,Diehl, p. 186 it is generally believed that the use of zero in the Americas predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs. Many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland, although the Olmec civilization ended by the , several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates.\n\nAlthough zero became an integral part of Maya numerals, with a different, empty tortoise-like \"shell shape\" used for many depictions of the \"zero\" numeral, it is assumed to have not influenced Old World numeral systems.\n\nQuipu, a knotted cord device, used in the Inca Empire and its predecessor societies in the Andean region to record accounting and other digital data, is encoded in a base ten positional system. Zero is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.\n\nClassical antiquity\nThe ancient Greeks had no symbol for zero (\u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd), and did not use a digit placeholder for it. They seemed unsure about the status of zero as a number. They asked themselves, \"How can nothing be something?\", leading to philosophical and, by the medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of zero and the vacuum. The paradoxes of Zeno of Elea depend in large part on the uncertain interpretation of zero.\n\nthumb|right|300px|alt=Fragment of papyrus with clear Greek script, lower-right corner suggests a tiny zero with a double-headed arrow shape above it|Example of the early Greek symbol for zero (lower right corner) from a 2nd-century papyrus\nBy 130\u00a0AD, Ptolemy, influenced by Hipparchus and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for zero (a small circle with a long overbar) in his work on mathematical astronomy called the Syntaxis Mathematica, also known as the Almagest. The way in which it is used can be seen in his table of chords in that book. Ptolemy's zero was used within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic Greek numerals. Because it was used alone, not just as a placeholder, this Hellenistic zero was perhaps the earliest documented use of a numeral representing zero in the Old World. However, the positions were usually limited to the fractional part of a number (called minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths, etc.)\u2014they were not used for the integral part of a number, indicating a concept perhaps better expressed as \"none\", rather than \"zero\" in the modern sense. In later Byzantine manuscripts of Ptolemy's Almagest, the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the Greek letter omicron (otherwise meaning 70).\n\nAnother zero was used in tables alongside Roman numerals by 525 (first known use by Dionysius Exiguus), but as a word, nulla meaning \"nothing\", not as a symbol. When division produced zero as a remainder, nihil, also meaning \"nothing\", was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval calculators of Easter. The initial \"N\" was used as a zero symbol in a table of Roman numerals by Bede or his colleagues around\u00a0725.\n\nChina\nthumb|right|alt=Five illustrated boxes from left to right contain a T-shape, an empty box, three vertical bars, three lower horizontal bars with an inverted wide T-shape above, and another empty box.

According to A History of Mathematics, the rods \"gave the decimal representation of a number, with an empty space denoting zero.\" The counting rod system is considered a positional notation system.Crossley, Lun. 1999, p. 12 \"the ancient Chinese system is a place notation system\"\n\nIn AD 690, Empress W\u01d4 promulgated Zetian characters, one of which was \"\u3007\". The symbol 0 for denoting zero is a variation of this character.\n\nZero was not treated as a number at that time, but as a \"vacant position\". Q\u00edn Ji\u01d4sh\u00e1o's 1247 Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections is the oldest surviving Chinese mathematical text using a round symbol for zero. Chinese authors had been familiar with the idea of negative numbers by the Han Dynasty , as seen in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art.Struik, Dirk J. (1987). A Concise History of Mathematics. New York: Dover Publications. pp. 32\u201333. \"In these matrices we find negative numbers, which appear here for the first time in history.\"\n\nIndia\nPingala (c. 3rd/2nd century BC), a Sanskrit prosody scholar, used binary numbers in the form of short and long syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables), a notation similar to Morse code. Pingala used the Sanskrit word \u015b\u016bnya explicitly to refer to zero.Kim Plofker (2009), Mathematics in India, Princeton University Press, , pp. 54\u201356. Quote \u2013 \"In the Chandah-sutra of Pingala, dating perhaps the third or second century BC, [ ...] Pingala's use of a zero symbol [\u015b\u016bnya] as a marker seems to be the first known explicit reference to zero.\" Kim Plofker (2009), Mathematics in India, Princeton University Press, , 55\u201356. \"In the Chandah-sutra of Pingala, dating perhaps the third or second century BC, there are five questions concerning the possible meters for any value \"n\".

Pingala's use of a zero symbol as a marker seems to be the first known explicit reference to zero.\n\nIt was considered that the earliest text to use a decimal place-value system, including a zero, is the Lokavibh\u0101ga, a Jain text on cosmology surviving in a medieval Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit original, which is internally dated to AD\u00a0458 (Saka era 380). In this text, \u015b\u016bnya (\"void, empty\") is also used to refer to zero.Ifrah, Georges (2000), p.\u00a0416.\n\nA symbol for zero, a large dot likely to be the precursor of the still-current hollow symbol, is used throughout the Bakhshali manuscript, a practical manual on arithmetic for merchants. In 2017 three samples from the manuscript were shown by radiocarbon dating to come from three different centuries: from 224-383 AD, 680-779 AD, and 885-993 AD, making it the world's oldest recorded use of the zero symbol. It is not known how the birch bark fragments from different centuries that form the manuscript came to be packaged together.\n\nThe origin of the modern decimal-based place value notation can be traced to the Aryabhatiya (c.\u00a0500), which states sth\u0101n\u0101t sth\u0101na\u1e41 da\u015bagu\u1e47a\u1e41 sy\u0101t \"from place to place each is ten times the preceding.\"Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata, translated by Walter Eugene Clark. The concept of zero as a digit in the decimal place value notation was developed in India, presumably as early as during the Gupta period , with the oldest unambiguous evidence dating to the 7th\u00a0century.Bourbaki, Nicolas Elements of the History of Mathematics (1998), p. 46. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia (2007), entry \"Algebra\"\n\nThe rules governing the use of zero appeared for the first time in Brahmagupta's Brahmasputha Siddhanta (7th\u00a0century).

Zero is also used as a placeholder in the Bakhshali manuscript, portions of which date from AD 224\u2013383.\n\nMiddle Ages\nTransmission to Islamic culture\n\nThe Arabic-language inheritance of science was largely Greek, followed by Hindu influences.Will Durant (1950), The Story of Civilization, Volume 4, The Age of Faith: Constantine to Dante \u2013 A.D. 325\u20131300, Simon & Schuster, , p. 241, Quote = \"The Arabic inheritance of science was overwhelmingly Greek, but Hindu influences ranked next. In 773, at Mansur's behest, translations were made of the Siddhantas \u2013 Indian astronomical treatises dating as far back as 425 BC; these versions may have the vehicle through which the \"Arabic\" numerals and the zero were brought from India into Islam. In 813, al-Khwarizmi used the Hindu numerals in his astronomical tables.\" In 773, at Al-Mansur's behest, translations were made of many ancient treatises including Greek, Roman, Indian, and others.\n\nIn AD 813, astronomical tables were prepared by a Persian mathematician, Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b, using Hindu numerals; and about 825, he published a book synthesizing Greek and Hindu knowledge and also contained his own contribution to mathematics including an explanation of the use of zero. This book was later translated into Latin in the 12th\u00a0century under the title Algoritmi de numero Indorum. This title means \"al-Khwarizmi on the Numerals of the Indians\". The word \"Algoritmi\" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name, and the word \"Algorithm\" or \"Algorism\" started meaning any arithmetic based on decimals.\n\nMuhammad ibn Ahmad al-Khwarizmi, in 976, stated that if no number appears in the place of tens in a calculation, a little circle should be used \"to keep the rows\". This circle was called \u1e63ifr.Will Durant (1950), The Story of Civilization, Volume 4, The Age of Faith, Simon & Schuster, , p. 241, Quote = \"In 976, Muhammad ibn Ahmad, in his Keys of the Sciences, remarked that if, in a calculation, no number appears in the place of tens, a little circle should be used \"to keep the rows\". This circle the Mosloems called \u1e63ifr, \"empty\" whence our cipher.\"\n\nTransmission to Europe\nThe Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system (base 10) reached Europe in the 11th century, via Al-Andalus through Spanish Muslims, the Moors, together with knowledge of astronomy and instruments like the astrolabe, first imported by Gerbert of Aurillac. For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as \"Arabic numerals\". The Italian mathematician Fibonacci or Leonardo of Pisa was instrumental in bringing the system into European mathematics in 1202, stating:\n\nAfter my father's appointment by his homeland as state official in the customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed in the study of calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0\u00a0 ... any number may be written.Sigler, L.,  Fibonacci's Liber Abaci. English translation, Springer, 2003.Grimm, R.E., \"The Autobiography of Leonardo Pisano\", Fibonacci Quarterly 11/1 (February 1973), pp. 99\u2013104.\n\nHere Leonardo of Pisa uses the phrase \"sign 0\", indicating it is like a sign to do operations like addition or multiplication. From the 13th\u00a0century, manuals on calculation (adding, multiplying, extracting roots, etc.) became common in Europe where they were called algorismus after the Persian mathematician al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b. The most popular was written by Johannes de Sacrobosco, about 1235 and was one of the earliest scientific books to be printed in 1488. Until the late 15th\u00a0century, Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals seem to have predominated among mathematicians, while merchants preferred to use the Roman numerals. In the 16th\u00a0century, they became commonly used in Europe.\n\nMathematics\n0 is the integer immediately preceding 1. Zero is an even numberLemma B.2.2, The integer 0 is even and is not odd, in  because it is divisible by 2 with no remainder. 0 is neither positive nor negative. Many definitions, Extract of pp. 254\u2013255 include 0 as a natural number, and then the only natural number not to be positive. Zero is a number which quantifies a count or an amount of null size. In most cultures, 0 was identified before the idea of negative things, or quantities less than zero, was accepted.\n\nThe value, or number, zero is not the same as the digit zero, used in numeral systems using positional notation. Successive positions of digits have higher weights, so inside a numeral the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system, for example, in the number 02. In some instances, a leading zero may be used to distinguish a number.\n\nElementary algebra\nThe number 0 is the smallest non-negative integer. The natural number following 0 is 1 and no natural number precedes 0. The number 0 may or may not be considered a natural number, but it is an integer, and hence a rational number and a real number (as well as an algebraic number and a complex number).\n\nThe number 0 is neither positive nor negative and is usually displayed as the central number in a number line. It is neither a prime number nor a composite number. It cannot be prime because it has an infinite number of factors, and cannot be composite because it cannot be expressed as a product of prime numbers (0 must always be one of the factors). Zero is, however, even (as well as being a multiple of any other integer, rational, or real number).\n\nThe following are some basic (elementary) rules for dealing with the number 0. These rules apply for any real or complex number x, unless otherwise stated.\n Addition: x + 0 = 0 + x = x. That is, 0 is an identity element (or neutral element) with respect to addition.\n Subtraction: x \u2212 0 = x and 0 \u2212 x = \u2212x.\n Multiplication: x \u00b7 0 = 0 \u00b7 x = 0.\n Division:  = 0, for nonzero x. But  is undefined, because 0 has no multiplicative inverse (no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1), a consequence of the previous rule.\n Exponentiation: x0 =  = 1, except that the case x = 0 may be left undefined in some contexts. For all positive real x, .\n\nThe expression , which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form  as a result of applying the lim operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is a so-called \"indeterminate form\". That does not simply mean that the limit sought is necessarily undefined; rather, it means that the limit of , if it exists, must be found by another method, such as l'H\u00f4pital's rule.\n\nThe sum of 0 numbers (the empty sum) is 0, and the product of 0 numbers (the empty product) is 1. The factorial 0! evaluates to 1, as a special case of the empty product.\n\nOther branches of mathematics\n In set theory, 0 is the cardinality of the empty set: if one does not have any apples, then one has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is defined to be the empty set. When this is done, the empty set is the von Neumann cardinal assignment for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. The cardinality function, applied to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.\n Also in set theory, 0 is the lowest ordinal number, corresponding to the empty set viewed as a well-ordered set.\n In propositional logic, 0 may be used to denote the truth value false.\n In abstract algebra, 0 is commonly used to denote a zero element, which is a neutral element for addition (if defined on the structure under consideration) and an absorbing element for multiplication (if defined).\n In lattice theory, 0 may denote the bottom element of a bounded lattice.\n In category theory, 0 is sometimes used to denote an initial object of a category.\n In recursion theory, 0 can be used to denote the Turing degree of the partial computable functions.\n\nRelated mathematical terms\n A zero of a function f is a point x in the domain of the function such that . When there are finitely many zeros these are called the roots of the function. This is related to zeros of a holomorphic function.\n The zero function (or zero map) on a domain D is the constant function with 0 as its only possible output value, i.e., the function f defined by  for all x in D. The zero function is the only function that is both even and odd. A particular zero function is a zero morphism in category theory; e.g., a zero map is the identity in the additive group of functions. The determinant on non-invertible square matrices is a zero map.\n Several branches of mathematics have zero elements, which generalize either the property , or the property  or both.\n\nPhysics\nThe value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an absolute temperature (as measured in kelvins) zero is the lowest possible value (negative temperatures are defined, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder). This is in contrast to for example temperatures on the Celsius scale, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. Measuring sound intensity in decibels or phons, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value\u2014for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In physics, the zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy of the ground state of the system.\n\nChemistry\nZero has been proposed as the atomic number of the theoretical element tetraneutron. It has been shown that a cluster of four neutrons may be stable enough to be considered an atom in its own right. This would create an element with no protons and no charge on its nucleus.\n\nAs early as 1926, Andreas von Antropoff coined the term neutronium for a conjectured form of matter made up of neutrons with no protons, which he placed as the chemical element of atomic number zero at the head of his new version of the periodic table. It was subsequently placed as a noble gas in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements.\n\nComputer science\nThe most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one, and this is the practice in early classic computer science programming languages such as Fortran and COBOL. However, in the late 1950s LISP introduced zero-based numbering for arrays while Algol 58 introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. For example, the elements of an array are numbered starting from 0 in C, so that for an array of n items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to . This permits an array element's location to be calculated by adding the index directly to address of the array, whereas 1-based languages precalculate the array's base address to be the position one element before the first.\n\nThere can be confusion between 0- and 1-based indexing, for example Java's JDBC indexes parameters from 1 although Java itself uses 0-based indexing.\n\nIn databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value. It is then said to have a null value. For numeric fields it is not the value zero. For text fields this is not blank nor the empty string. The presence of null values leads to three-valued logic. No longer is a condition either true or false, but it can be undetermined. Any computation including a null value delivers a null result.\n\nA null pointer is a pointer in a computer program that does not point to any object or function. In C, the integer constant 0 is converted into the null pointer at compile time when it appears in a pointer context, and so 0 is a standard way to refer to the null pointer in code. However, the internal representation of the null pointer may be any bit pattern (possibly different values for different data types).\n\nIn mathematics  both \u22120 and +0 represent exactly the same number, i.e., there is no \"positive zero\" or \"negative zero\" distinct from zero. However, in some computer hardware signed number representations, zero has two distinct representations, a positive one grouped with the positive numbers and a negative one grouped with the negatives; this kind of dual representation is known as signed zero, with the latter form sometimes called negative zero. These representations include the signed magnitude and one's complement binary integer representations (but not the two's complement binary form used in most modern computers), and most floating point number representations (such as IEEE 754 and IBM S/390 floating point formats).\n\nIn binary, 0 represents the value for \"off\", which means no electricity flow.\n\nZero is the value of false in many programming languages.\n\nThe Unix epoch (the date and time associated with a zero timestamp) begins the midnight before the first of January 1970.Paul DuBois.\n\"MySQL Cookbook: Solutions for Database Developers and Administrators\"\n2014.\np. 204.Arnold Robbins; Nelson Beebe.\n\"Classic Shell Scripting\".\n2005.\np. 274Iztok Fajfar.\n\"Start Programming Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\".\n2015.\np. 160.\n\nThe MacOS epoch and Palm OS epoch (the date and time associated with a zero timestamp) begins the midnight before the first of January 1904.Darren R.

In some countries, dialling 0 places a call for operator assistance.\n DVDs that can be played in any region are sometimes referred to as being \"region 0\"\n Roulette wheels usually feature a \"0\" space (and sometimes also a \"00\" space), whose presence is ignored when calculating payoffs (thereby allowing the house to win in the long run).\n In Formula One, if the reigning World Champion no longer competes in Formula One in the year following their victory in the title race, 0 is given to one of the drivers of the team that the reigning champion won the title with. This happened in 1993 and 1994, with Damon Hill driving car 0, due to the reigning World Champion (Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost respectively) not competing in the championship.\n On the U.S. Interstate Highway System, in most states exits are numbered based on the nearest milepost from the highway's western or southern terminus within that state. Several that are less than half a mile (800 m) from state boundaries in that direction are numbered as Exit 0.\n\nSymbols and representations\n\n71px|alt=horizontal guidelines with a zero touching top and bottom, a three dipping below, and a six cresting above the guidelines, from left to right|left\nThe modern numerical digit 0 is usually written as a circle or ellipse. Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter O more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0. Typewriters originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0. The distinction came into prominence on modern character displays.\n\nA slashed zero can be used to distinguish the number from the letter. The digit 0 with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 displays and has continued with some modern computer typefaces such as Andal\u00e9 Mono, and in some airline reservation systems. One variation uses a short vertical bar instead of the dot. Some fonts designed for use with computers made one of the capital-O\u2013digit-0 pair more rounded and the other more angular (closer to a rectangle). A further distinction is made in falsification-hindering typeface as used on German car number plates by slitting open the digit 0 on the upper right side. Sometimes the digit 0 is used either exclusively, or not at all, to avoid confusion altogether.\n\nYear label\n\nIn the BC calendar era, the year 1\u00a0BC is the first year before AD\u00a01; there is not a year zero.

{"title": "1", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1", "text": "1 (one, also called unit, unity, and (multiplicative) identity) is a number, numeral, and glyph. It represents a single entity, the unit of counting or measurement. For example, a line segment of unit length is a line segment of length\u00a01. It is also the first of the infinite sequence of natural numbers, followed by\u00a02.\n\n Etymology \n\nThe word one can be used as a noun, an adjective and a pronoun.\n\nIt comes from the English word an, which comes from the Proto-Germanic root *ainaz. The Proto-Germanic root *ainaz comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *oi-no-.\n\nCompare the Proto-Germanic root *ainaz to Old Frisian an, Gothic ains, Danish en, Dutch een, German eins and Old Norse einn.\n\nCompare the Proto-Indo-European root *oi-no- (which means \"one, single\") to Greek oinos (which means \"ace\" on dice), Latin unus (one), Old Persian aivam, Old Church Slavonic -inu and ino-, Lithuanian vienas, Old Irish oin and Breton un (one).\n\n As a number \nOne, sometimes referred to as unity,Skoog, Douglas. Principles of Instrumental Analysis. Brooks/Cole, 2007, p. 758. is the first non-zero natural number. It is thus the integer before two and after zero, and the first positive odd number.\n\nAny number multiplied by one remains that number, as one is the identity for multiplication. As a result, 1 is its own factorial, its own square and square root, its own cube and cube root, and so on. One is also the result of the empty product, as any number multiplied by one is itself. It is also the only natural number that is neither composite nor prime with respect to division, but instead considered a unit (meaning of ring theory).\n\n As a digit \nthumb|alt=Script progression from left to right: simple horizontal stroke, an upward-curved horizontal arc, another arc with a thick dot on left vertex, a sinewave-shaped upward then downward arc with dot on left, then a nearly-vertical version like a musical eighth-note with dot on top vertex, and finally a simple vertical stroke|left\nThe glyph used today in the Western world to represent the number 1, a vertical line, often with a serif at the top and sometimes a short horizontal line at the bottom, traces its roots back to the Indians, who wrote 1 as a horizontal line, much like the Chinese character . The Gupta wrote it as a curved line, and the Nagari sometimes added a small circle on the left (rotated a quarter turn to the right, this 9-look-alike became the present day numeral 1 in the Gujarati and Punjabi scripts). The Nepali also rotated it to the right but kept the circle small. This eventually became the top serif in the modern numeral, but the occasional short horizontal line at the bottom probably originates from similarity with the Roman numeral . In some countries, the serif at the top is sometimes extended into a long upstroke, sometimes as long as the vertical line, which can lead to confusion with the glyph for seven in other countries. Where the 1 is written with a long upstroke, the number 7 has a horizontal stroke through the vertical line.\n\nWhile the shape of the 1 character has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures, the character usually is of x-height, as, for example, in alt=Horizontal guidelines with a one fitting within lines, a four extending below guideline, and an eight poking above guideline.\n\nthumb|alt=Decorative clay/stone circular off-white sundial with bright gold stylized sunburst in center of 24 hour clock face, one through twelve clockwise on right, and one through twelve again clockwise on left, with J shapes where ones' digits would be expected when numbering the clock hours. Shadow suggests 3 PM toward lower left.|The 24-hour tower clock in Venice, using J as a symbol for 1.\nMany older typewriters do not have a separate symbol for 1 and use the lowercase letter l instead. It is possible to find cases when the uppercase J is used, while it may be for decorative purposes.\n\n Mathematics \nMathematically, 1 is:\nin arithmetic (algebra) and calculus, the natural number that follows 0 and precedes 2 and the multiplicative identity element of the integers, real numbers and complex numbers;\nmore generally, in algebra, the multiplicative identity (also called unity), usually of a group or a ring.\n\nTallying is often referred to as \"base 1\", since only one mark\u00a0\u2013 the tally itself\u00a0\u2013 is needed. This is more formally referred to as a unary numeral system. Unlike base\u00a02 or base\u00a010, this is not a positional notation.\n\nSince the base 1 exponential function (1x) always equals 1, its inverse does not exist (which would be called the logarithm base\u00a01 if it did exist).\n\nThere are two ways to write the real number 1 as a recurring decimal: as 1.000..., and as 0.999....\n\nFormalizations of the natural numbers have their own representations of 1:\nin the Peano axioms, 1 is the successor of 0;\nin Principia Mathematica, 1 is defined as the set of all singletons (sets with one element);\nin the Von Neumann cardinal assignment of natural numbers, 1 is defined as the set {0}.\n\nIn a multiplicative group or monoid, the identity element is sometimes denoted 1, but e (from the German Einheit, \"unity\") is also traditional. However, 1 is especially common for the multiplicative identity of a ring, i.e., when an addition and 0 are also present. When such a ring has characteristic n not equal to 0, the element called 1 has the property that  (where this 0 is the additive identity of the ring). Important examples are finite fields.\n\n1 is the first figurate number of every kind, such as triangular number, pentagonal number and centered hexagonal number, to name just a few.\n\nIn many mathematical and engineering problems, numeric values are typically normalized to fall within the unit interval from 0 to 1, where 1 usually represents the maximum possible value in the range of parameters.  Likewise, vectors are often normalized to give unit vectors, that is vectors of magnitude one, because these often have more desirable properties. Functions, too, are often normalized by the condition that they have integral one, maximum value one, or square integral one, depending on the application.\n\nBecause of the multiplicative identity, if f(x) is a multiplicative function, then f(1) must equal 1.\n\nIt is also the first and second number in the Fibonacci sequence (0 is the zeroth) and is the first number in many other mathematical sequences.\n\n1 is neither a prime number nor a composite number, but a unit (meaning of ring theory), like \u22121 and, in the Gaussian integers, i and \u2212i. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees unique factorization over the integers only up to units. (For example, , but if units are included, is also equal to, say,  among infinitely many similar \"factorizations\".)\n\nThe definition of a field requires that 1 must not be equal to 0. Thus, there are no fields of characteristic 1. Nevertheless, abstract algebra can consider the field with one element, which is not a singleton and is not a set at all.\n\n1 is the only positive integer divisible by exactly one positive integer (whereas prime numbers are divisible by exactly two positive integers, composite numbers are divisible by more than two positive integers, and zero is divisible by all positive integers). 1 was formerly considered prime by some mathematicians, using the definition that a prime is divisible only by 1 and itself. However, this complicates the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, so modern definitions exclude units.\n\nBy definition, 1 is the magnitude, absolute value, or norm of a unit complex number, unit vector, and a unit matrix (more usually called an identity matrix). Note that the term unit matrix is sometimes used to mean something quite different.\n\nBy definition, 1 is the probability of an event that is almost certain to occur.\n\n1 is the most common leading digit in many sets of data, a consequence of Benford's law.\n\n1 is the only known Tamagawa number for a simply connected algebraic group over a number field.\n\nThe generating function that has all coefficients 1 is given by\n\nThis power series converges and has finite value if and only if, .\n\nIn category theory, 1 is sometimes used to denote the terminal object of a category.\n\nIn number theory, 1 is the value of Legendre's constant, which was introduced in 1808 by Adrien-Marie Legendre in expressing the asymptotic behavior of the prime-counting function. Legendre's constant was originally conjectured to be approximately 1.08366, but was proven to equal exactly 1 in 1899.\n\n Table of basic calculations \nMultiplication123456789101112131415161718192021222324255010010001 \u00d7 x12345678910111213141516171819202122232425501001000\n\nDivision1234567891011121314151 \u00f7 x10.50.0.250.20.10.0.1250.0.10.0.080.0.00.0x \u00f7 1123456789101112131415\n\nExponentiation1234567891011121314151617181920111111111111111111111x1234567891011121314151617181920\n\n In technology \n50px|right|alt=Chasing-arrow triangle with numeral one within|1 as a resin identification code, used in recycling\n The resin identification code used in recycling to identify polyethylene terephthalate.\nThe ITU country code for the North American Numbering Plan area, which includes the United States, Canada, and parts of the Caribbean\nA binary code is a sequence of 1 and 0 that is used in computers for representing any kind of data.\nIn many physical devices, 1 represents the value for \"on\", which means that electricity is flowing.\nThe numerical value of true in many programming languages.\n1 is the ASCII code of \"Start of Header\".\n\n In science \nDimensionless quantities are also known as quantities of dimension one.\n1 is the atomic number of hydrogen.\n+1 is the electric charge of positrons and protons.\nGroup 1 of the periodic table consists of the alkali metals.\nPeriod 1 of the periodic table consists of just two elements, hydrogen and helium.\nThe dwarf planet Ceres has the minor-planet designation 1 Ceres because it was the first asteroid to be discovered.\nThe Roman numeral I often stands for the first-discovered satellite of a planet or minor planet (such as Neptune I, a.k.a.

{"title": "Algorithm", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "text": "thumb|right| Flowchart of an algorithm (Euclid's algorithm) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers a and b in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B \u2265 A yields \"yes\" (or true) (more accurately the number b in location B is greater than or equal to the number a in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B \u2190 B \u2212 A (meaning the number b \u2212 a replaces the old b). Similarly, IF A > B, THEN A \u2190 A \u2212 B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).\nthumb|Ada Lovelace's diagram from \"note G\", the first published computer algorithm.\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, an algorithm () is a set of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation. Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.\n\nAs an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time\"Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words\" (Rogers 1987:2). and in a well-defined formal languageWell defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: \"There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations\" (Rogers 1987:2). for calculating a function.\"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a function (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality\", (Rogers 1987:1). Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),\"An algorithm has zero or more inputs, i.e., quantities which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins\" (Knuth 1973:5). the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite\"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'\" (Knuth 1973:5). number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\"\"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs\" (Knuth 1973:5). and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: \"a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without the use of continuous methods or analogue devices ... carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice\" (Rogers 1987:2).\n\nThe concept of algorithm has existed for centuries. Greek mathematicians used algorithms in the sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers, and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n\nThe word algorithm itself is derived from the 9th century mathematician Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b, Latinized Algoritmi. A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define \"effective calculability\"Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274 or \"effective method\".Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225 Those formalizations included the G\u00f6del\u2013Herbrand\u2013Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's Formulation 1 of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936\u201337 and 1939.\n\n Etymology \nThe word 'algorithm' has its roots in Latinizing the name of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in a first step to algorismus. Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (,  , c. 780\u2013850) was a Persian  mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, whose name means 'the native of Khwarazm', a region that was part of Greater Iran and is now in Uzbekistan.\n\nAbout 825, al-Khwarizmi wrote an Arabic language treatise on the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, which was translated into Latin during the 12th century under the title Algoritmi de numero Indorum. This title means \"Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians\", where \"Algoritmi\" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name. Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through another of his books, the Algebra.Foremost mathematical texts in history, according to Carl B. Boyer. In late medieval Latin, algorismus, English 'algorism', the corruption of his name, simply meant the \"decimal number system\". In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 'number' (cf. 'arithmetic'), the Latin word was altered to algorithmus, and the corresponding English term 'algorithm' is first attested in the 17th century; the modern sense was introduced in the 19th century.Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition, 2012 s.v.\n\nIn English, it was first used in about 1230 and then by Chaucer in 1391. English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that \"algorithm\" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.\n\nAnother early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled Carmen de Algorismo composed by Alexandre de Villedieu. It begins thus:\n\nwhich translates as:\n\nThe poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals.\n\nInformal definition\n\nAn informal definition could be \"a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations\",Stone 1973:4 which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations, and (for example) any prescribed bureaucratic procedure.\nGenerally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.Stone simply requires that \"it must terminate in a finite number of steps\" (Stone 1973:7\u20138).\n\nA prototypical example of an algorithm is the Euclidean algorithm to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the flowchart above and as an example in a later section.\n\n offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:\n\nNo human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough\u2020 ( \u2020\"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons\") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give explicit instructions for determining the nth member of the set, for arbitrary finite n. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which they could be followed by a computing machine, or by a human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.Boolos and Jeffrey 1974,1999:19\n\nAn \"enumerably infinite set\" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that \"creates\" output integers from an arbitrary \"input\" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as y = m + n \u2013 two arbitrary \"input variables\" m and n that produce an output y. But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):\nPrecise instructions (in language understood by \"the computer\")cf Stone 1972:5 for a fast, efficient, \"good\"Knuth 1973:7 states: \"In practice we not only want algorithms, we want good algorithms ... one criterion of goodness is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm ... other criteria are the adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity, and elegance, etc.\" process that specifies the \"moves\" of \"the computer\" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities)cf Stone 1973:6 to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols m and n, symbols + and = ... and \"effectively\"Stone 1973:7\u20138 states that there must be, \"...a procedure that a robot [i.e., computer] can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction\". Stone adds finiteness of the process, and definiteness (having no ambiguity in the instructions) to this definition. produce, in a \"reasonable\" time,Knuth, loc. cit output-integer y at a specified place and in a specified format.\n\nThe concept of algorithm is also used to define the notion of  decidability. That notion is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules. In logic, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.\n\nFormalization\n\nAlgorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a Turing-complete system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):\n Minsky: \"But we will also maintain, with Turing ... that any procedure which could \"naturally\" be called effective, can, in fact, be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments ... in its favor are hard to refute\".\n\n Gurevich: \"...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine\".Gurevich 2000:1, 3\n\nTypically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an output device and stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more data structures.\n\nFor some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).\n\nBecause an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting \"from the top\" and going \"down to the bottom\", an idea that is described more formally by flow of control.\n\nSo far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, \"mechanical\" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation, setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of \"memory\" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.\n\nFor some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see functional programming and logic programming.\n\nExpressing algorithms\nAlgorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, programming languages or control tables (processed by interpreters). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.\n\nThere is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given Turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at finite-state machine, state transition table and control table), as flowcharts and drakon-charts (see more at state diagram), or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called \"sets of quadruples\" (see more at Turing machine).\n\nRepresentations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:Sipser 2006:157\n 1 High-level description\n \"...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level, we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head.\"\n 2 Implementation description\n \"...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level, we do not give details of states or transition function.\"\n 3 Formal description\n Most detailed, \"lowest level\", gives the Turing machine's \"state table\".\n\nFor an example of the simple algorithm \"Add m+n\" described in all three levels, see Algorithm#Examples.\n\nDesign\n\nAlgorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of operation research, such as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns, such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its Big O.\n\nTypical steps in the development of algorithms:\n Problem definition\n Development of a model\n Specification of the algorithm\n Designing an algorithm\n Checking the correctness of the algorithm\n Analysis of algorithm\n Implementation of algorithm\n Program testing\n Documentation preparation\n\nImplementation\nright|thumb|Logical NAND algorithm implemented electronically in 7400 chip\nMost algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or in a mechanical device.\n\nComputer algorithms\nthumb|right|176px|Flowchart examples of the canonical B\u00f6hm-Jacopini structures: the SEQUENCE (rectangles descending the page), the WHILE-DO and the IF-THEN-ELSE. The three structures are made of the primitive conditional GOTO (IF test=true THEN GOTO step xxx) (a diamond), the unconditional GOTO (rectangle), various assignment operators (rectangle), and HALT (rectangle). Nesting of these structures inside assignment-blocks result in complex diagrams (cf Tausworthe 1977:100, 114).\n\nIn computer systems, an algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended \"target\" computer(s) to produce output from given (perhaps null) input. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher time complexity) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.\n\n\"Elegant\" (compact) programs, \"good\" (fast) programs : The notion of \"simplicity and elegance\" appears informally in Knuth and precisely in Chaitin:\nKnuth: \" ... we want good algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion ... is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm .... Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc\"Knuth 1973:7\n\nChaitin: \" ... a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does\"Chaitin 2005:32\n\nChaitin prefaces his definition with: \"I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant\u2014such a proof would solve the Halting problem (ibid).\n\nAlgorithm versus function computable by an algorithm: For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that \"It is ... important to distinguish between the notion of algorithm, i.e. procedure and the notion of function computable by algorithm, i.e. mapping yielded by procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms\".Rogers 1987:1\u20132\n\nUnfortunately, there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)\u2014an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.\n\nComputers (and computors), models of computation: A computer (or human \"computor\"In his essay \"Calculations by Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis\" Seig 2002:390 credits this distinction to Robin Gandy, cf Wilfred Seig, et al., 2002 Reflections on the foundations of mathematics: Essays in honor of Solomon Feferman, Association for Symbolic Logic, A.K. Peters Ltd, Natick, MA.) is a restricted type of machine, a \"discrete deterministic mechanical device\"cf Gandy 1980:126, Robin Gandy Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms appearing on pp. 123\u2013148 in J. Barwise et al. 1980 The Kleene Symposium, North-Holland Publishing Company. that blindly follows its instructions.A \"robot\": \"A computer is a robot that performs any task that can be described as a sequence of instructions.\" cf Stone 1972:3 Melzak's and Lambek's primitive modelsLambek's \"abacus\" is a \"countably infinite number of locations (holes, wires etc.) together with an unlimited supply of counters (pebbles, beads, etc). The locations are distinguishable, the counters are not\". The holes have unlimited capacity, and standing by is an agent who understands and is able to carry out the list of instructions\" (Lambek 1961:295). Lambek references Melzak who defines his Q-machine as \"an indefinitely large number of locations ... an indefinitely large supply of counters distributed among these locations, a program, and an operator whose sole purpose is to carry out the program\" (Melzak 1961:283). B-B-J (loc. cit.) add the stipulation that the holes are \"capable of holding any number of stones\" (p. 46). Both Melzak and Lambek appear in The Canadian Mathematical Bulletin, vol. 4, no. 3, September 1961. reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable locations, (ii) discrete, indistinguishable countersIf no confusion results, the word \"counters\" can be dropped, and a location can be said to contain a single \"number\". (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are effective relative to the capability of the agent.\"We say that an instruction is effective if there is a procedure that the robot can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction.\" (Stone 1972:6)\n\nMinsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's \"abacus\" model in his \"Very Simple Bases for Computability\".cf Minsky 1967: Chapter 11 \"Computer models\" and Chapter 14 \"Very Simple Bases for Computability\" pp. 255\u2013281 in particular Minsky's machine proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF\u2013THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three assignment (replacement, substitution)cf Knuth 1973:3. operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L \u2190 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L \u2190 L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L \u2190 L \u2212 1).But always preceded by IF\u2013THEN to avoid improper subtraction. Rarely must a programmer write \"code\" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is Turing complete with only four general types of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.  However, a few different assignment instructions (e.g. DECREMENT, INCREMENT, and ZERO/CLEAR/EMPTY for a Minsky machine) are also required for Turing-completeness; their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer. The unconditional GOTO is a convenience; it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero e.g. the instruction \" Z \u2190 0 \"; thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx is unconditional.\n\nSimulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language: Knuth advises the reader that \"the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example\".Knuth 1973:4 But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can effectively execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.Stone 1972:5. Methods for extracting roots are not trivial: see Methods of computing square roots.\n\nThis means that the programmer must know a \"language\" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).\n\nBut what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes \"even if we base complexity theory on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of simulation enters\". When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a \"modulus\" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's \"decrement\").\n\nStructured programming, canonical structures: Per the Church\u2013Turing thesis, any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be Turing complete, and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types\u2014conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while \"undisciplined\" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in \"spaghetti code\", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand \"it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language\".John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz 1985 Back to Basic: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. Reading, MA, . Tausworthe augments the three B\u00f6hm-Jacopini canonical structures:Tausworthe 1977:101 SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.Tausworthe 1977:142 An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to proofs of correctness using mathematical induction.Knuth 1973 section 1.2.1, expanded by Tausworthe 1977 at pages 100ff and Chapter 9.1\n\nCanonical flowchart symbolscf Tausworthe 1977: The graphical aide called a flowchart, offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like the program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The B\u00f6hm\u2013Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can \"nest\" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols, and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.\n\nExamples\n\nAlgorithm example\nthumb|right|An animation of the quicksort algorithm sorting an array of randomized values. The red bars mark the pivot element; at the start of the animation, the element farthest to the right-hand side is chosen as the pivot.\n\nOne of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description in English prose, as:\n\nHigh-level description:\n If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.\n Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.\n For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number, consider this number to be the largest number in the set.\n When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.\n\n(Quasi-)formal description:\nWritten in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode or pidgin code:\n\n   Input: A list of numbers L.\n   Output: The largest number in the list L.\n\n   if L.size = 0 return null\n   largest \u2190 L[0]\n   for each item in L, do\n     if item > largest, then\n       largest \u2190 item\n   return largest\n\nEuclid's algorithm\n\n250px|thumb|left|The example-diagram of Euclid's algorithm from T.L. Heath (1908), with more detail added. Euclid does not go beyond a third measuring and gives no numerical examples. Nicomachus gives the example of 49 and 21: \"I subtract the less from the greater; 28 is left; then again I subtract from this the same 21 (for this is possible); 7 is left; I subtract this from 21, 14 is left; from which I again subtract 7 (for this is possible); 7 is left, but 7 cannot be subtracted from 7.\" Heath comments that \"The last phrase is curious, but the meaning of it is obvious enough, as also the meaning of the phrase about ending 'at one and the same number'.\"(Heath 1908:300).\n\nEuclid's algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) to two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII (\"Elementary Number Theory\") of his Elements.Heath 1908:300; Hawking's Dover 2005 edition derives from Heath. Euclid poses the problem thus: \"Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure\". He defines \"A number [to be] a multitude composed of units\": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero. To \"measure\" is to place a shorter measuring length s successively (q times) along longer length l until the remaining portion r is less than the shorter length s.\" 'Let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than itself.' This is a neat abbreviation for saying, measure along BA successive lengths equal to CD until a point F is reached such that the length FA remaining is less than CD; in other words, let BF be the largest exact multiple of CD contained in BA\" (Heath 1908:297) In modern words, remainder r = l \u2212 q\u00d7s, q being the quotient, or remainder r is the \"modulus\", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.For modern treatments using division in the algorithm, see Hardy and Wright 1979:180, Knuth 1973:2 (Volume 1), plus more discussion of Euclid's algorithm in Knuth 1969:293\u2013297 (Volume 2).\n\nFor Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be \u201cproper\u201d; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).\n\nEuclid's original proof adds a third requirement: the two lengths must not be prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a reductio ad absurdum proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the greatest.Euclid covers this question in his Proposition 1. While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number \"1\" for their common measure. So, to be precise, the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.\n\n350px|thumb|right|A graphical expression of Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor for 1599 and 650.\n 1599 = 650\u00d72 + 299\n 650 = 299\u00d72 + 52\n 299 = 52\u00d75 + 39\n 52 = 39\u00d71 + 13\n 39 = 13\u00d73 + 0\n\nComputer language for Euclid's algorithm\nOnly a few instruction types are required to execute Euclid's algorithm\u2014some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.\n A location is symbolized by upper case letter(s), e.g. S, A, etc.\n The varying quantity (number) in a location is written in lower case letter(s) and (usually) associated with the location's name. For example, location L at the start might contain the number l = 3009.\n\nAn inelegant program for Euclid's algorithm\nthumb|163px|right|\"Inelegant\" is a translation of Knuth's version of the algorithm with a subtraction-based remainder-loop replacing his use of division (or a \"modulus\" instruction). Derived from Knuth 1973:2\u20134. Depending on the two numbers \"Inelegant\" may compute the g.c.d. in fewer steps than \"Elegant\".\n\nThe following algorithm is framed as Knuth's four-step version of Euclid's and Nicomachus', but, rather than using division to find the remainder, it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length s from the remaining length r until r is less than s. The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2\u20134:\n\nINPUT:\n  [Into two locations L and S put the numbers l and s that represent the two lengths]:\n   INPUT L, S\n  [Initialize R: make the remaining length r equal to the starting/initial/input length l]:\n   R \u2190 L\n\nE0: [Ensure r \u2265 s.]\n  [Ensure the smaller of the two numbers is in S and the larger in R]:\n   IF R > S THEN\n     the contents of L is the larger number so skip over the exchange-steps 4, 5 and 6:\n     GOTO step 6\n   ELSE\n     swap the contents of R and S.\n    L \u2190 R (this first step is redundant, but is useful for later discussion).\n    R \u2190 S\n    S \u2190 L\n\nE1: [Find remainder]: Until the remaining length r in R is less than the shorter length s in S, repeatedly subtract the measuring number s in S from the remaining length r in R.\n  IF S > R THEN\n     done measuring so\n     GOTO 10\n   ELSE\n     measure again,\n    R \u2190 R \u2212 S\n    [Remainder-loop]:\n     GOTO 7.\n\nE2: [Is the remainder zero?]: EITHER (i) the last measure was exact, the remainder in R is zero, and the program can halt, OR (ii) the algorithm must continue: the last measure left a remainder in R less than measuring number in S.\n  IF R = 0 THEN\n      done so\n      GOTO step 15\n    ELSE\n      CONTINUE TO step 11,\n\nE3: [Interchange s and r]: The nut of Euclid's algorithm. Use remainder r to measure what was previously smaller number s; L serves as a temporary location.\n   L \u2190 R\n   R \u2190 S\n   S \u2190 L\n   [Repeat the measuring process]:\n     GOTO 7\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n  [Done. S contains the greatest common divisor]:\n    PRINT S\n\nDONE:\n  HALT, END, STOP.\n\nAn elegant program for Euclid's algorithm\n The flowchart of \"Elegant\" can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language, the steps are numbered, and the instruction LET [] = [] is the assignment instruction symbolized by \u2190.\n  5 REM Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor\n  6 PRINT \"Type two integers greater than 0\"\n  10 INPUT A,B\n  20 IF B=0 THEN GOTO 80\n  30 IF A > B THEN GOTO 60\n  40 LET B=B-A\n  50 GOTO 20\n  60 LET A=A-B\n  70 GOTO 20\n  80 PRINT A\n  90 END\nHow \"Elegant\" works: In place of an outer \"Euclid loop\", \"Elegant\" shifts back and forth between two \"co-loops\", an A > B loop that computes A \u2190 A \u2212 B, and a B \u2264 A loop that computes B \u2190 B \u2212 A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend \u2212 Subtrahend), the minuend can become s (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new r (the length to be measured); in other words the \"sense\" of the subtraction reverses.\n\nThe following version can be used with Object Oriented languages:\n// Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor\nint euclidAlgorithm (int A, int B){\n     A=Math.abs(A);\n     B=Math.abs(B);\n     while (B!=0){\n          if (A>B) A=A-B;\n          else B=B-A;\n     }\n     return A;\n}\n\nTesting the Euclid algorithms\nDoes an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually give some confidence in the core functionality. But tests are not enough. For test cases, one source uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two relatively prime numbers 14157 and 5950.\n\nBut \"exceptional cases\"While this notion is in widespread use, it cannot be defined precisely. must be identified and tested. Will \"Inelegant\" perform properly when R > S, S > R, R = S? Ditto for \"Elegant\": B > A, A > B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? (\"Inelegant\" computes forever in all cases; \"Elegant\" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if negative numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the domain of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that instantiates it) is a partial function rather than a total function. A notable failure due to exceptions is the Ariane 5 Flight 501 rocket failure (June 4, 1996).\n\nProof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction: Knuth demonstrates the application of mathematical induction to an \"extended\" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes \"a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm\".Knuth 1973:13\u201318. He credits \"the formulation of algorithm-proving in terms of assertions and induction\" to R W. Floyd, Peter Naur, C.A.R. Hoare, H.H. Goldstine and J. von Neumann. Tausworth 1977 borrows Knuth's Euclid example and extends Knuth's method in section 9.1 Formal Proofs (pp. 288\u2013298). Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.Tausworthe 1997:294\n\nMeasuring and improving the Euclid algorithms\nElegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed): With only six core instructions, \"Elegant\" is the clear winner, compared to \"Inelegant\" at thirteen instructions. However, \"Inelegant\" is faster (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). Algorithm analysiscf Knuth 1973:7 (Vol. I), and his more-detailed analyses on pp. 1969:294\u2013313 (Vol II). indicates why this is the case: \"Elegant\" does two conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas \"Inelegant\" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, on average much time is wasted doing a \"B = 0?\" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.\n\nCan the algorithms be improved?: Once the programmer judges a program \"fit\" and \"effective\"\u2014that is, it computes the function intended by its author\u2014then the question becomes, can it be improved?\n\nThe compactness of \"Inelegant\" can be improved by the elimination of five steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm;Breakdown occurs when an algorithm tries to compact itself. Success would solve the Halting problem. rather, it can only be done heuristically; i.e., by exhaustive search (examples to be found at Busy beaver), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of inductive reasoning, etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with \"Elegant\" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it \"more elegant\" than \"Elegant\", at nine steps.\n\nThe speed of \"Elegant\" can be improved by moving the \"B=0?\" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now \"Elegant\" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B, and R, S would require a detailed analysis.\n\nAlgorithmic analysis\n\nIt is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(n), using the big O notation with n as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of O(1), if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(n) if it is counted.\n\nDifferent algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or 'effort' than others. For example, a binary search algorithm (with cost O(log n) ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O(n) ) when used for table lookups on sorted lists or arrays.\n\nFormal versus empirical\n\nThe analysis, and study of algorithms is a discipline of computer science, and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually pseudocode is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their algorithmic efficiency is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a \"one off\" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.\n\nEmpirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. Benchmarks may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.\nEmpirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner.\n\n Execution efficiency \n\nTo illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to FFT algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging. In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.Haitham Hassanieh, Piotr Indyk, Dina Katabi, and Eric Price, \"ACM-SIAM Symposium On Discrete Algorithms (SODA) , Kyoto, January 2012. See also the sFFT Web Page. Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.\n\n Classification \nThere are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.\n\n By implementation \nOne way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.\n\n \nint gcd(int A, int B) {\n    if (B == 0)\n        return A;\n    else if (A > B)\n        return gcd(A-B,B);\n    else\n        return gcd(A,B-A);\n} Recursive C implementation of Euclid's algorithm from the above flowchart\n\n Recursion\n A recursive algorithm is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition (also known as termination condition) matches, which is a method common to functional programming. Iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like loops and sometimes additional data structures like stacks to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example, towers of Hanoi is well understood using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.\n Logical\n An algorithm may be viewed as controlled logical deduction. This notion may be expressed as: Algorithm = logic + control.Kowalski 1979 The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the logic programming paradigm. In pure logic programming languages, the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant semantics: a change in the axioms produces a well-defined change in the algorithm.\n Serial, parallel or distributed\n Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to parallel algorithms or distributed algorithms. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a computer network. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.\n Deterministic or non-deterministic\n Deterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas non-deterministic algorithms solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of heuristics.\n Exact or approximate\n While many algorithms reach an exact solution, approximation algorithms seek an approximation that is closer to the true solution. The approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the Knapsack problem, where there is a set of given items. Its goal is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that can be carried is no more than some fixed number X. So, the solution must consider weights of items as well as their value.\n Quantum algorithm\n They run on a realistic model of quantum computation. The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of Quantum computing such as quantum superposition or quantum entanglement.\n\n By design paradigm \nAnother way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:\n\n Brute-force or exhaustive search\n This is the naive method of trying every possible solution to see which is best.\n Divide and conquer\n A divide and conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually recursively) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is merge sorting. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a decrease and conquer algorithm, that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of a decrease and conquer algorithm is the binary search algorithm.\n Search and enumeration\n Many problems (such as playing chess) can be modeled as problems on graphs. A graph exploration algorithm specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes search algorithms, branch and bound enumeration and backtracking.\nRandomized algorithm\n Such algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some of these problems, it is known that the fastest approximations must involve some randomness.For instance, the volume of a convex polytope (described using a membership oracle) can be approximated to high accuracy by a randomized polynomial time algorithm, but not by a deterministic one: see . Whether randomized algorithms with polynomial time complexity can be the fastest algorithms for some problems is an open question known as the P versus NP problem. There are two large classes of such algorithms:\n Monte Carlo algorithms return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. RP is the subclass of these that run in polynomial time.\n Las Vegas algorithms always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. ZPP.\n Reduction of complexity\n This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better-known problem for which we have (hopefully) asymptotically optimal algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose complexity is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one selection algorithm for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as transform and conquer.\n Back tracking\n In this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.\n\n Optimization problems \n\nFor optimization problems there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:\n\n Linear programming\n When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints of the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular simplex algorithm.George B. Dantzig and Mukund N. Thapa. 2003. Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extensions. Springer-Verlag. Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the maximum flow problem for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an integer then it is classified in integer programming. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.\n Dynamic programming\n When a problem shows optimal substructures\u2014meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems\u2014and overlapping subproblems, meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called dynamic programming avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted graph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and memoization go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a table of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.\n The greedy method\n A greedy algorithm is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at local optima, that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method. Huffman Tree, Kruskal, Prim, Sollin are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.\nThe heuristic method\nIn optimization problems, heuristic algorithms can be used to find a solution close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an approximation algorithm.\n\n By field of study \n\nEvery field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are search algorithms, sorting algorithms, merge algorithms, numerical algorithms, graph algorithms, string algorithms, computational geometric algorithms, combinatorial algorithms, medical algorithms, machine learning, cryptography, data compression algorithms and parsing techniques.\n\nFields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.\n\n By complexity \n\nAlgorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:\n Constant time: if the time needed by the algorithm is the same, regardless of the input size. E.g. an access to an array element.\n Linear time: if the time is proportional to the input size. E.g. the traverse of a list.\n Logarithmic time: if the time is a logarithmic function of the input size. E.g. binary search algorithm.\n Polynomial time: if the time is a power of the input size. E.g. the bubble sort algorithm has quadratic time complexity.\n Exponential time: if the time is an exponential function of the input size. E.g. Brute-force search.\n\nSome problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.\n\n Continuous algorithms \nThe adjective \"continuous\" when applied to the word \"algorithm\" can mean:\n An algorithm operating on data that represents continuous quantities, even though this data is represented by discrete approximations\u2014such algorithms are studied in numerical analysis; or\n An algorithm in the form of a differential equation that operates continuously on the data, running on an analog computer.\n\n Legal issues \n\nAlgorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute \"processes\" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in Gottschalk v. Benson). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in Diamond v. Diehr, the application of a simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of synthetic rubber was deemed patentable. The patenting of software is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially data compression algorithms, such as Unisys' LZW patent.\n\nAdditionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see export of cryptography).\n\n History: Development of the notion of \"algorithm\" \n\n Ancient Near East \nAlgorithms were used in ancient Greece. Two examples are the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which was described in Introduction to Arithmetic by Nicomachus, and the Euclidean algorithm, which was first described in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC). Babylonian clay tablets describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.\n\n Discrete and distinguishable symbols \nTally-marks: To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually Roman numerals and the abacus evolved (Dilson, p.\u00a016\u201341). Tally marks appear prominently in unary numeral system arithmetic used in Turing machine and Post\u2013Turing machine computations.\n\n Manipulation of symbols as \"place holders\" for numbers: algebra \nThe work of the ancient Greek geometers (Euclidean algorithm), the  Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, and the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (from whose name the terms \"algorism\" and \"algorithm\" are derived), and Western European mathematicians culminated in Leibniz's notion of the calculus ratiocinator (ca 1680):\n\n Mechanical contrivances with discrete states \nThe clock: Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven clock as \"The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]\", in particular, the verge escapementBolter 1984:24 that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. \"The accurate automatic machine\"Bolter 1984:26 led immediately to \"mechanical automata\" beginning in the 13th century and finally to \"computational machines\"\u2014the difference engine and analytical engines of Charles Babbage and Countess Ada Lovelace, mid-19th century.Bolter 1984:33\u201334, 204\u2013206. Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer\u2014Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a real Turing-complete computer instead of just a calculator\u2014and is sometimes called \"history's first programmer\" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.\n\nLogical machines 1870 \u2013 Stanley Jevons' \"logical abacus\" and \"logical machine\": The technical problem was to reduce Boolean equations when presented in a form similar to what is now known as Karnaugh maps. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple \"abacus\" of \"slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically ... More recently, however, I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a Logical Machine\" His machine came equipped with \"certain moveable wooden rods\" and \"at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] ...\". With this machine he could analyze a \"syllogism or any other simple logical argument\".All quotes from W. Stanley Jevons 1880 Elementary Lessons in Logic: Deductive and Inductive, Macmillan and Co., London and New York. Republished as a googlebook; cf Jevons 1880:199\u2013201. Louis Couturat 1914 the Algebra of Logic, The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago and London. Republished as a googlebook; cf Couturat 1914:75\u201376 gives a few more details; he compares this to a typewriter as well as a piano. Jevons states that the account is to be found at January 20, 1870 The Proceedings of the Royal Society.\n\nThis machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society.Jevons 1880:199\u2013200 Another logician John Venn, however, in his 1881 Symbolic Logic, turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: \"I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines\"; see more at Algorithm characterizations. But not to be outdone he too presented \"a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's abacus ... [And] [a]gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine\".All quotes from John Venn 1881 Symbolic Logic, Macmillan and Co., London. Republished as a googlebook. cf Venn 1881:120\u2013125. The interested reader can find a deeper explanation in those pages.\n\nJacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony \u2013 the electromechanical relay: Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the Jacquard loom (1801), precursor to Hollerith cards (punch cards, 1887), and \"telephone switching technologies\" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers.Bell and Newell diagram 1971:39, cf. Davis 2000 By the mid-19th century the telegraph, the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as \"dots and dashes\" a common sound. By the late 19th century the ticker tape (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the teleprinter (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of Baudot code on tape.\n\nTelephone-switching networks of electromechanical relays (invented 1835) was behind the work of George Stibitz (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the \"burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. \"He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device\".* Melina Hill, Valley News Correspondent, A Tinkerer Gets a Place in History, Valley News West Lebanon NH, Thursday, March 31, 1983, p. 13.\n\nDavis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two \"binary states\" open and closed):\n It was only with the development, beginning in the 1930s, of electromechanical calculators using electrical relays, that machines were built having the scope Babbage had envisioned.\"Davis 2000:14\n\n Mathematics during the 19th century up to the mid-20th century \nSymbols and rules: In rapid succession, the mathematics of George Boole (1847, 1854), Gottlob Frege (1879), and Giuseppe Peano (1888\u20131889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method (1888) was \"the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language\".van Heijenoort 1967:81ff\n\nBut Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is \"perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a \" 'formula language', that is a lingua characterica, a language written with special symbols, \"for pure thought\", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules\".van Heijenoort's commentary on Frege's Begriffsschrift, a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought in van Heijenoort 1967:1 The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell in their Principia Mathematica (1910\u20131913).\n\nThe paradoxes: At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular, the Burali-Forti paradox (1897), the Russell paradox (1902\u201303), and the Richard Paradox.Dixon 1906, cf. Kleene 1952:36\u201340 The resultant considerations led to Kurt G\u00f6del's paper (1931)\u2014he specifically cites the paradox of the liar\u2014that completely reduces rules of recursion to numbers.\n\nEffective calculability: In an effort to solve the Entscheidungsproblem defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an \"effective method\" or \"effective calculation\" or \"effective calculability\" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: Alonzo Church, Stephen Kleene and J.B. Rosser's \u03bb-calculuscf. footnote in Alonzo Church 1936a in Davis 1965:90 and 1936b in Davis 1965:110 a finely honed definition of \"general recursion\" from the work of G\u00f6del acting on suggestions of Jacques Herbrand (cf. G\u00f6del's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene.Kleene 1935\u20136 in Davis 1965:237ff, Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:255ff Church's proofChurch 1936 in Davis 1965:88ff that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, Emil Post's definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction.cf. \"Finite Combinatory Processes \u2013 formulation 1\", Post 1936 in Davis 1965:289\u2013290 Alan Turing's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his \"a- [automatic-] machine\"Turing 1936\u201337 in Davis 1965:116ff\u2014in effect almost identical to Post's \"formulation\", J. Barkley Rosser's definition of \"effective method\" in terms of \"a machine\".Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:226 S.C. Kleene's proposal of a precursor to \"Church thesis\" that he called \"Thesis I\",Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:273\u2013274 and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis \"Church's Thesis\"Kleene 1952:300, 317 and proposing \"Turing's Thesis\".Kleene 1952:376\n\n Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936\u201337, 1939) \n\nEmil Post (1936) described the actions of a \"computer\" (human being) as follows:\n\"...two concepts are involved: that of a symbol space in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out, and a fixed unalterable set of directions.\n\nHis symbol space would be\n\"a two-way infinite sequence of spaces or boxes... The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.\n\n\"One box is to be singled out and called the starting point. ...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke. Likewise, the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes...\n\n\"A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem. This process terminates only when it comes to the direction of type (C ) [i.e., STOP]\".Turing 1936\u201337 in Davis 1965:289\u2013290 See more at Post\u2013Turing machine\nthumb|200px|Alan Turing's statue at Bletchley Park\nAlan Turing's workTuring 1936 in Davis 1965, Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160 preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: \"Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter, and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'\".Hodges, p.\u00a096 Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we might conjecture that all were influences.\n\nTuring\u2014his model of computation is now called a Turing machine\u2014begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and \"states of mind\". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.Turing 1936\u201337:116\n\n\"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book...I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite...\n\n\"The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his \"state of mind\" at that moment. We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...\n\n\"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided.\"Turing 1936\u201337 in Davis 1965:136\n\nTuring's reduction yields the following:\n\"The simple operations must therefore include:\n\"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares\n\"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.\n\"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must, therefore, be taken to be one of the following:\n\"(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.\n\"(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind\"\n\n\"We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer.\"\n\nA few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:\n\"A function is said to be \"effectively calculable\" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition ... [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to G\u00f6del, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing, and Post] ... We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability \u2020 with effective calculability ... .\n\"\u2020 We shall use the expression \"computable function\" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let \"effectively calculable\" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions\".Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160\n\n J.B. Rosser (1939) and S.C. Kleene (1943) \nJ. Barkley Rosser defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):\n\"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.\" (Rosser 1939:225\u2013226)\n\nRosser's footnote No. 5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of \u03bb-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory (1936); (2) Herbrand and G\u00f6del and their use of recursion in particular G\u00f6del's use in his famous paper On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936\u201337) in their mechanism-models of computation.\n\nStephen C. Kleene defined as his now-famous \"Thesis I\" known as the Church\u2013Turing thesis. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):\n\"12. Algorithmic theories... In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, \"yes\" or \"no,\" to the question, \"is the predicate value true?\"\" (Kleene 1943:273)\n\n History after 1950 \nA number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of \"algorithm\", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, foundations of mathematics (especially the Church\u2013Turing thesis) and philosophy of mind (especially arguments about artificial intelligence).

{"title": "Axiomatic system", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system", "text": "In mathematics, an axiomatic system is any set of axioms from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to logically derive theorems. A theory consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of formal system. A formal theory typically means an axiomatic system, for example formulated within model theory. A formal proof is a complete rendition of a mathematical proof within a formal system.\n\n Properties \n\nAn axiomatic system is said to be consistent if it lacks contradiction, i.e. the ability to derive both a statement and its denial from the system's axioms.\n\nIn an axiomatic system, an axiom is called independent if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system. A system will be called independent if each of its underlying axioms is independent. Although independence is not a necessary requirement for a system, consistency usually is, but see neutrosophic logic.\n\nAn axiomatic system will be called complete if for every statement, either itself or its negation is derivable from the system's axioms.\n\n Relative consistency \n\nBeyond consistency, relative consistency is also the mark of a worthwhile axiom system.  This is when the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second, such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second.\n\nA good example is the relative consistency of neutral geometry or absolute geometry with respect to the theory of the real number system.  Lines and points are undefined terms in absolute geometry, but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems.\n\n Models \n\nA model for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set, which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system, in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system. The existence of a concrete model proves the consistency of a system. A model is called concrete if the meanings assigned are objects and relations from the real world, as opposed to an abstract model which is based on other axiomatic systems.\n\nModels can also be used to show the independence of an axiom in the system. By constructing a valid model for a subsystem without a specific axiom, we show that the omitted axiom is independent if its correctness does not necessarily follow from the subsystem.\n\nTwo models are said to be isomorphic if a one-to-one correspondence can be found between their elements, in a manner that preserves their relationship. An axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called categorial (sometimes categorical), and the property of categoriality (categoricity) ensures the completeness of a system.\n\n Axiomatic method \n\nStating definitions and propositions in a way such that each new term can be formally eliminated by the priorly introduced terms requires primitive notions (axioms) to avoid infinite regress. This way of doing mathematics is called the axiomatic method.<ref>\"Set Theory and its Philosophy, a Critical Introduction\" S.6; Michael Potter, Oxford, 2004</ref>\n\nA common attitude towards the axiomatic method is logicism. In their book Principia Mathematica, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell attempted to show that all mathematical theory could be reduced to some collection of axioms. More generally, the reduction of a body of propositions to a particular collection of axioms underlies the mathematician's research program. This was very prominent in the mathematics of the twentieth century, in particular in subjects based around homological algebra.\n\nThe explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. For example, mathematicians opted that rings need not be commutative, which differed from Emmy Noether's original formulation. Mathematicians decided to consider topological spaces more generally without the separation axiom which Felix Hausdorff originally formulated.\n\nThe Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, the result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory, allowed the \"proper\" formulation of set-theory problems and helped to avoid the paradoxes of na\u00efve set theory. One such problem was the Continuum hypothesis. Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial axiom of choice included is commonly abbreviated ZFC, where C stands for choice.  Many authors use ZF to refer to the axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. Today ZFC is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of mathematics.\n\n History \n\nMathematical methods developed to some degree of sophistication in ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, and China, apparently without employing the axiomatic method.\n\nEuclid of Alexandria authored the earliest extant axiomatic presentation of Euclidean geometry and number theory. Many axiomatic systems were developed in the nineteenth century, including non-Euclidean geometry, the foundations of real analysis, Cantor's set theory, Frege's work on foundations, and Hilbert's 'new' use of axiomatic method as a research tool. For example, group theory was first put on an axiomatic basis towards the end of that century. Once the axioms were clarified (that inverse elements should be required, for example), the subject could proceed autonomously, without reference to the transformation group origins of those studies.\n\n Issues \n\nNot every consistent body of propositions can be captured by a describable collection of axioms. Call a collection of axioms recursive if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is an axiom. G\u00f6del's First Incompleteness Theorem then tells us that there are certain consistent bodies of propositions with no recursive axiomatization. Typically, the computer can recognize the axioms and logical rules for deriving theorems, and the computer can recognize whether a proof is valid, but to determine whether a proof exists for a statement is only soluble by \"waiting\" for the proof or disproof to be generated.  The result is that one will not know which propositions are theorems and the axiomatic method breaks down. An example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the natural numbers. The Peano Axioms (described below) thus only partially axiomatize this theory.\n\nIn practice, not every proof is traced back to the axioms. At times, it is not clear which collection of axioms a proof appeals to. For example, a number-theoretic statement might be expressible in the language of arithmetic (i.e. the language of the Peano Axioms) and a proof might be given that appeals to topology or complex analysis. It might not be immediately clear whether another proof can be found that derives itself solely from the Peano Axioms.\n\nAny more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory, but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions, and even if it is, it is not likely to shed light on anything. Philosophers of mathematics sometimes assert that mathematicians choose axioms \"arbitrarily\", but it is possible that although they may appear arbitrary when viewed only from the point of view of the canons of deductive logic, that appearance is due to a limitation on the purposes that deductive logic serves.\n\n Example: The Peano axiomatization of natural numbers \n\nThe mathematical system of natural numbers  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is based on an axiomatic system first written down by the mathematician Peano in 1889. He chose the axioms, in the language of a single unary function symbol S (short for \"successor\"), for the set of natural numbers to be:\n\n There is a natural number 0.\n Every natural number a has a successor, denoted by Sa.\n There is no natural number whose successor is 0.\n Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if a \u2260 b, then Sa \u2260 Sb.\n If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number it is possessed by, then it is possessed by all natural numbers (\"Induction axiom\").\n\n Axiomatization \n\nIn mathematics, axiomatization is the formulation of a system of statements (i.e. axioms) that relate a number of primitive terms in order that a consistent body of propositions may be derived deductively from these statements. Thereafter, the proof of any proposition should be, in principle, traceable back to these axioms.\n\n See also \n\n List of logic systems\n Axiom schema\n G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem\n Hilbert-style deduction system\n Logicism\n Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, an axiomatic system for set theory and today's most common foundation for mathematics.\n\n References \n\n \n Eric W.

{"title": "Bertrand Russell", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell", "text": "Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell,  (; 18 May 1872 \u2013 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, essayist, social critic, political activist, and Nobel laureate.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"Bertrand Russell\", 1 May 2003 At various points in his life, Russell considered himself a liberal, a socialist and a pacifist, although he also confessed that his sceptical nature had led him to feel that he had \"never been any of these things, in any profound sense.\" Russell was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Russell led the British \"revolt against idealism\".Russell and G.\u00a0E. Moore broke themselves free from British Idealism which, for nearly 90 years, had dominated British philosophy. Russell would later recall in \"My Mental Development\" that \"with a sense of escaping from prison, we allowed ourselves to think that grass is green, that the sun and stars would exist if no one was aware of them...\"\u2014Russell B, (1944) \"My Mental Development\", in Schilpp, Paul Arthur: The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell, New York: Tudor, 1951, pp. 3\u201320. He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, colleague G.\u00a0E. Moore and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ludwig Wittgenstein. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians. With A. N. Whitehead he wrote Principia Mathematica, an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics, the quintessential work of classical logic. His philosophical essay \"On Denoting\" has been considered a \"paradigm of philosophy\". His work has had a considerable influence on mathematics, logic, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer science (see type theory and type system) and philosophy, especially the philosophy of language, epistemology and metaphysics.\n\nRussell was a prominent anti-war activist and he championed anti-imperialism. Occasionally, he advocated preventive nuclear war, before the opportunity provided by the atomic monopoly had passed and \"welcomed with enthusiasm\" world government. He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I.Samoiloff, Louise Cripps. C .L. R. James: Memories and Commentaries, p.\u00a019. Associated University Presses, 1997.  Later, Russell concluded that war against Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany was a necessary \"lesser of two evils\" and criticised Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War and was an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament. In 1950, Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought\".The Nobel Prize in Literature 1950\u00a0\u2014 Bertrand Russell: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1950 was awarded to Bertrand Russell \"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought\". Retrieved on 22 March 2013.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life and background\nthumb|upright|left|Russell as a four-year-old\nthumb|Childhood home, Pembroke Lodge\n\nBertrand Russell was born on 18 May 1872 at Ravenscroft, Trellech, Monmouthshire, into an influential and liberal family of the British aristocracy.Sidney Hook, \"Lord Russell and the War Crimes Trial\", Bertrand Russell: critical assessments, Vol. 1, edited by A. D. Irvine, New York 1999, p.\u00a0178 His parents, Viscount and Viscountess Amberley, were radical for their times. Lord Amberley consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist Douglas Spalding. Both were early advocates of birth control at a time when this was considered scandalous. Lord Amberley was an atheist and his atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher John Stuart Mill to act as Russell's secular godfather.Russell, Bertrand and Perkins, Ray (ed.) Yours faithfully, Bertrand Russell. Open Court Publishing, 2001, p.\u00a04. Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life.\n\nHis paternal grandfather, the Earl Russell, had been asked twice by Queen Victoria to form a government, serving her as Prime Minister in the 1840s and 1860s. The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the peerage with the rise of the Tudor dynasty (see: Duke of Bedford). They established themselves as one of the leading British Whig families, and participated in every great political event from the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536\u20131540 to the Glorious Revolution in 1688\u20131689 and the Great Reform Act in 1832.Cokayne, G. E.; Vicary Gibbs, H. A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, eds.

Reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, UK: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000.\n\nLady Amberley was the daughter of Lord and Lady Stanley of Alderley. Russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother, one of the campaigners for education of women.The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866\u20131928 By Elizabeth Crawford\n\nChildhood and adolescence\nRussell had two siblings: brother Frank (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of diphtheria, followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of bronchitis following a long period of depression. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly Victorian paternal grandparents, who lived at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park. His grandfather, former Prime Minister Earl Russell, died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the Countess Russell (n\u00e9e Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.\n\nThe countess was from a Scottish Presbyterian family, and successfully petitioned the Court of Chancery to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting Darwinism and supporting Irish Home Rule), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on social justice and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. (One could challenge the view that Bertrand stood up for his principles, based on his own well-known quotation: \"I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong\".) Her favourite Bible verse, \"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil\" (Exodus 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.\n\nRussell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide. He was educated at home by a series of tutors.The Nobel Foundation (1950). Bertrand Russell: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1950. Retrieved 11 June 2007. When Russell was eleven years old, his brother Frank introduced him to the work of Euclid, which he described in his autobiography as \"one of the great events of my life, as dazzling as first love.\"\n\nDuring these formative years he also discovered the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. Russell wrote: \"I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy\". Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of Christian religious dogma, which he found very unconvincing. At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no free will and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading Mill's Autobiography, he abandoned the \"First Cause\" argument and became an atheist.\n\nHe traveled to the continent in 1890 with an American friend, Edward FitzGerald, and with FitzGerald's family he visited the Paris Exhibition of 1889 and was able to climb the Eiffel Tower soon after it was completed.\n\nUniversity and first marriage\nthumb|Russell at Trinity College in 1893\nRussell won a scholarship to read for the Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, and commenced his studies there in 1890, taking as coach Robert Rumsey Webb. He became acquainted with the younger George Edward Moore and came under the influence of Alfred North Whitehead, who recommended him to the Cambridge Apostles. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh Wrangler in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.\n\nRussell was 17\u00a0years old in the summer of 1889 when he met the family of Alys Pearsall Smith, an American Quaker five years older, who was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia. He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family \u2013 they knew him primarily as \"Lord John's grandson\" and enjoyed showing him off.\n\nHe soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her. She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage. A lengthy period of separation began in 1911 with Russell's affair with Lady Ottoline Morrell, and he and Alys finally divorced in 1921 to enable Russell to remarry.\n\nDuring his years of separation from Alys, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Morrell and the actress Lady Constance Malleson. Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the English governess and writer, and first wife of T. S. Eliot.\n\nEarly career\nthumb|left|upright|Russell in 1907\nRussell began his published work in 1896 with German Social Democracy, a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the London School of Economics. He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.\n\nHe now started an intensive study of the foundations of mathematics at Trinity.\nIn 1898 he wrote An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry which discussed the Cayley\u2013Klein metrics used for non-Euclidean geometry.Russell, Bertrand (1898) An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry, p.\u00a032, re-issued 1956 by Dover Books\nHe attended the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in 1900 where he met Giuseppe Peano and Alessandro Padoa.  The Italians had responded to Georg Cantor, making a science of set theory; they gave Russell their literature including the Formulario mathematico. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon Russell's paradox. In 1903 he published The Principles of Mathematics, a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of logicism, that mathematics and logic are one and the same.\n\nAt the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a \"sort of mystic illumination\", after witnessing Whitehead's wife's acute suffering in an angina attack. \"I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty ... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the Buddha to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable\", Russell would later recall. \"At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person.\"\n\nIn 1905 he wrote the essay \"On Denoting\", which was published in the philosophical journal Mind. Russell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908. The three-volume Principia Mathematica, written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier The Principles of Mathematics, soon made Russell world-famous in his field.\n\nIn 1910 he became a University of Cambridge lecturer at Trinity College where he studied. He was considered for a Fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was \"anti-clerical\", essentially because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student Ludwig Wittgenstein, who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various phobias and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in 1922. Russell delivered his lectures on Logical Atomism, his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of World War I. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp at the end of the conflict.\n\nFirst World War\nDuring World War I, Russell was one of the few people to engage in active pacifist activities. In 1916, because of his lack of a Fellowship, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914. He later described this as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression, in Free Thought and Official Propaganda. Russell played a significant part in the Leeds Convention in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand \"anti-war socialists\" gather; many being delegates from the Independent Labour Party and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement. The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour MPs, including Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden, as well as former Liberal MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor Arnold Lupton.  After the event, Russell told Lady Ottoline Morrell that, \"to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody\".\n\nThe Trinity incident resulted in Russell being fined \u00a3100, which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the King James Bible that was stamped \"Confiscated by Cambridge Police\".\n\nA later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the United States to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in Brixton prison (see Bertrand Russell's views on society) in 1918. He later said of his imprisonment:\n\nRussell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.\n\nIn 1924, Bertrand again gained press attention when attending a \"banquet\" in the House of Commons with well-known campaigners, including Arnold Lupton, who had been a Member of Parliament and had also endured imprisonment for \"passive resistance to military or naval service\".\n\nG. H. Hardy on the Trinity controversy and Russell's personal life\nIn 1941, G. H. Hardy wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled Bertrand Russell and Trinity \u2013 published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by C. D. Broad \u2013 in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.\n\nThe reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an \"unusual application\" and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the \u2018world of learning\u2019 knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the Tarner Lectures on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: The Analysis of Matter, published in 1927. In the preface to the Trinity pamphlet, Hardy wrote:\n\nBetween the wars\nIn August 1920, Russell travelled to Soviet Russia as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the Russian Revolution. He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled \"Soviet Russia1920\", for the US magazine The Nation. He met Vladimir Lenin and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an \"impish cruelty\" in him and comparing him to \"an opinionated professor\". He cruised down the Volga on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He subsequently wrote a book, The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism,Russell, Bertrand The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism by Bertrand Russell, 1920 about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the Soviet regime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he had heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure that these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.\n\nthumb|left|Russell with his children, John and Kate\nRussell's lover Dora Black, a British author, feminist and socialist campaigner, visited Soviet Russia independently at the same time; in contrast to his reaction, she was enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.\n\nThe following autumn, Russell, accompanied by Dora, visited Peking (as it was then known in the West) to lecture on philosophy for a year. He went with optimism and hope, seeing China as then being on a new path. Other scholars present in China at the time included John Dewey and Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian Nobel-laureate poet. Before leaving China, Russell became gravely ill with pneumonia, and incorrect reports of his death were published in the Japanese press. When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading \"Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists\". Apparently they found this harsh and reacted resentfully.\n\nDora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England on 26 August 1921. Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Russell's children with Dora were John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell, born on 16 November 1921, and Katharine Jane Russell (now Lady Katharine Tait), born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of physics, ethics, and education to the layman.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and Cornwall, spending summers in Porthcurno. In the 1922 and 1923 general elections Russell stood as a Labour Party candidate in the Chelsea constituency, but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was unsuccessful on both occasions.\n\nTogether with Dora, Russell founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near Harting, West Sussex. On 8 July 1930 Dora gave birth to her third child Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.Inside Beacon Hill: Bertrand Russell as Schoolmaster. Jespersen, Shirley ERIC# EJ360344, published 1987\n\nOn a tour through the US in 1927, Russell met Barry Fox (later Barry Stevens), who became a well-known Gestalt therapist and writer in later years.Kranz, D. (2011): Barry Stevens: Leben Gestalten. In: Gestaltkritik, 2/2011, p.\u00a04-11. Russell and Fox developed an intensive relationship. In Fox's words: \"...for three years we were very close.\"Stevens, B. (1970): Don't Push the River. Lafayette, Cal. (Real People Press), p.\u00a026. Fox sent her daughter Judith to Beacon Hill School for some time.Gorham, D. (2005): Dora and Bertrand Russell and Beacon Hill School, in: Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies, n.s. 25, (summer 2005), p.\u00a039 \u2013 76, p.\u00a057. From 1927 to 1932 Russell wrote 34 letters to Fox.Spadoni, C. (1981): Recent Acquisitions: Correspondence, in: Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies, Vol 1, Iss. 1, Article 6,  43 \u2013 67.\n\nUpon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell.\n\nRussell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry. They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an Oxford undergraduate named Patricia (\"Peter\") Spence, who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell, 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the Liberal Democrat party.\n\nRussell returned to the London School of Economics to lecture on the science of power in 1937.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Russell became a close friend and collaborator of V. K. Krishna Menon, then secretary of the India League, the foremost lobby in the United Kingdom for Indian self-rule.\n\nSecond World War\nRussell opposed rearmament against Nazi Germany. In 1937 he wrote in a personal letter: \"If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister.\" In 1940, he changed his view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare: \"War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils.\"Russell, Bertrand, \"The Future of Pacifism\", The American Scholar, (1943) 13: 7\u201313\n\nBefore World War II, Russell taught at the University of Chicago, later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the UCLA Department of Philosophy.Bertrand Russell Rides Out Collegiate Cyclone LIFE, Vol. 8, No. 14, 1 Apr 1940 He was appointed professor at the City College of New York (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him \"morally unfit\" to teach at the college due to his opinions, especially those relating to sexual morality, detailed in Marriage and Morals (1929). The matter was however taken to the New York Supreme Court by Jean Kay who was afraid that her daughter would be harmed by the appointment, though her daughter was not a student at CCNY. Many intellectuals, led by John Dewey, protested at his treatment. Albert Einstein's oft-quoted aphorism that \"great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds\" originated in his open letter, dated 19 March 1940, to Morris Raphael Cohen, a professor emeritus at CCNY, supporting Russell's appointment.Einstein quotations and sources.. Retrieved 9 July 2009. Dewey and Horace M. Kallen edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in The Bertrand Russell Case. Russell soon joined the Barnes Foundation, lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of A History of Western Philosophy. His relationship with the eccentric Albert C. Barnes soon soured, and he returned to the UK in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.\n\nLater life\nthumb|Russell in 1954\nRussell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly The Brains Trust and the Third Programme, on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world-famous outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in Trondheim, Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) of an aeroplane crash in Hommelvik in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane. A History of Western Philosophy (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1942 Russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism, capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles, in an inquiry on dialectical materialism, launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher Wolfgang Paalen in his journal DYN, saying \"I think the metaphysics of both Hegel and Marx plain nonsense \u2013 Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than Mary Baker Eddy's. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism.\"Russell to Edward Renouf, assistant of Wolfgang Paalen, 23 March 1942 (Succession Wolfgang Paalen, Berlin); this letter is cited in DYN, No. 2, Mexico, July\u2013August 1942, p.\u00a052\n\nIn 1943, Russell expressed support for Zionism: \"I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to Jews to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture\".\n\nIn a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the USSR's aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an atomic bomb than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides. At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a first strike in a war with the USSR, including Nigel Lawson, who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.\nHowever, just after the atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the United States possessed them and before the USSR did. In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practiced in the Soviet Union.He wrote: \"There is reason to think Stalin will insist on a new orthodoxy in atomic physics, since there is much in quantum theory that runs contrary to Communist dogma. An atomic bomb' made on Marxist principles would probably not explode because, after all, Marxist science was that of a hundred years ago. For those who fear the military power of Russia there is, therefore, some reason to rejoice in the muzzling of Russian science.\" Russell, Bertrand \"Stalin Declares War on Science\"\u00a0 Review of Langdon-Davies,\u00a0Russia Puts Back the Clock,\u00a0Evening Standard\u00a0(London), 7 September 1949, p.\u00a09. After it became known that the USSR carried out its nuclear bomb tests, Russell declared his position advocating for the total abolition of atomic weapons.\n\nIn 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural Reith Lectures\u2014what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled Authority and the Individual, explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to Words and Things by Ernest Gellner, which was highly critical of the later thought of Ludwig Wittgenstein and of ordinary language philosophy. Gilbert Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind, which caused Russell to respond via The Times. The result was a month-long correspondence in The Times between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.T. P. Uschanov, The Strange Death of Ordinary Language Philosophy. The controversy has been described by the writer Ved Mehta in Fly and the Fly Bottle (1963).\n\nIn the King's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the Order of Merit, and the following year he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. When he was given the Order of Merit, George VI was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, \"You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted\".Ronald W. Clark, Bertrand Russell and His World, p.\u00a094. (1981)  Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply \"That's right, just like your brother\" immediately came to mind. In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).\n\nthumb|left|Russell in the 1950s\nIn 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a C.I.A.-funded anti-communist organization committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the Cold War.Frances Stonor Saunders, \"The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters.\" New York Press, 1999. Print. Russell was one of the best known patrons of the Congress, until he resigned in 1956Frances Stonor Saunder, \"\"The Cultural Cold War: The CIA And the World of Arts and Letters.\" New York Press, 1999. Print.\n\nRussell married his fourth wife, Edith Finch, soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend Lucy Donnelly. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious mental illness, which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.\n\nIn September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in Brixton Prison for \"breach of peace\" after taking part in an anti-nuclear demonstration in London. The magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to \"good behaviour\", to which Russell replied: \"No, I won't.\"Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, Bertrand Russell, 1872\u20131970 [1970], p.\u00a012\n\nIn 1962 Russell played a public role in the Cuban Missile Crisis: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless. Russell sent this telegram to President Kennedy:\n\nYOUR ACTION DESPERATE. THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION. CIVILIZED MAN CONDEMNS IT. WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MURDER. ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR... END THIS MADNESS.\n\nAccording to historian Peter Knight, after JFK's assassination, Russell, \"prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer Mark Lane in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee in June 1964, members of which included Michael Foot MP, Caroline Benn, the publisher Victor Gollancz, the writers John Arden and J. B. Priestley, and the Oxford history professor Hugh Trevor-Roper.\" Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the Warren Commission Report was published, setting forth 16 Questions on the Assassination and equating the Oswald case with the Dreyfus affair of late 19th-century France, in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.Peter Knight, The Kennedy Assassination, Edinburgh University Press Ltd., 2007, p.\u00a077.\n\nPolitical causes\nthumb|left|Russell (centre) alongside his wife Edith, leading a CND anti-nuclear march in London, 18 February 1961\nBertrand Russell was opposed to war from early on, his opposition to World War I being used as grounds for his dismissal from Trinity College at Cambridge. This incident fused two of his most controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted Fellow status, which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic.\n\nHe later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in Free Thought and Official Propaganda, where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously \"bad\", must be protected not only from direct State intervention, but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:\n\nRussell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to nuclear disarmament and opposing the Vietnam War. The 1955 Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time. In 1966\u20131967, Russell worked with Jean-Paul Sartre and many other intellectual figures to form the Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam.  He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period.\n\nIn 1956, immediately before and during the Suez Crisis, Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the  pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the Suez Canal area \"where general interest is involved\". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the Hungarian Revolution and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets \"because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating\". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which Michael Polanyi had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell (Psychology Press, 2005)\n\nIn November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, urging a summit to consider \"the conditions of co-existence\". Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in The Observer, proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany \"freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West\". US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles.Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell (pp. 212\u2013213)\n\nRussell was asked by The New Republic, a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all hydrogen bombs, with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the Oder-Neisse line as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing Arab nationalism, and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the People's Republic of China, and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.\n\nHe was in contact with Lionel Rogosin while the latter was filming his anti-war film Good Times, Wonderful Times in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the New Left. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the Vietnam War, and felt that the US government's policies there were near-genocidal. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the Jerusalem Prize, an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society. In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the Arab countries to accept an arms embargo and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry. In October 1965 he tore up his Labour Party card because he suspected Harold Wilson's Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.\n\nFinal years, death and legacy\nthumb|Russell on a 1972 stamp of India\nIn June 1955 Russell had leased Plas Penrhyn in Penrhyndeudraeth, Merionethshire, Wales and on 5 July of the following year it became his and Edith's principal residence.\n\nthumb|Bust of Russell in Red Lion Square\nRussell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Russell made a cameo appearance playing himself in the anti-war Hindi film Aman, by Mohan Kumar, which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.\n\nOn 23 November 1969 he wrote to The Times newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in Czechoslovakia was \"highly alarming\". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General U Thant of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The following month, he protested to Alexei Kosygin over the expulsion of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn from the Soviet Union of Writers.\n\nOn 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement condemning \"Israel's aggression in the Middle East\", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the War of Attrition. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-Six-Day War borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in Cairo on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.\n\nRussell died of influenza on 2 February 1970 at his home in Penrhyndeudraeth. His body was cremated in Colwyn Bay on 5 February 1970. In accordance with his will, there was no religious ceremony; his ashes were scattered over the Welsh mountains later that year. He left an estate valued at \u00a369,423 (\u00a31.09 million or US$1.4 million in 2018 money).Russell, 1970, p.\u00a03 at probatesearch.service.gov.uk. Retrieved 29 August 2015\nIn 1980 a memorial to Russell was commissioned by a committee including the philosopher A. J. Ayer. It consists of a bust of Russell in Red Lion Square in London sculpted by Marcelle Quinton.\n\nLady Katharine Jane Tait, Russell's daughter, founded the Bertrand Russell Society in 1974 to preserve and understand his work.  It publishes a newsletter, holds meetings and awards prizes for scholarship. She also authored several essays about her father; as well as a book, My Father, Bertrand Russell, which was published in 1975.\n\nTitles and honours from birth\nRussell held throughout his life the following styles and honours:\n from birth until 1908: The Honourable Bertrand Arthur William Russell\n from 1908 until 1931: The Honourable Bertrand Arthur William Russell, FRS\n from 1931 until 1949: The Right Honourable The Earl Russell, FRS\n from 1949 until death: The Right Honourable The Earl Russell, OM, FRS\n\nViews\n\nPhilosophy\n\nRussell is generally credited with being one of the founders of analytic philosophy. He was deeply impressed by Gottfried Leibniz (1646\u20131716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except aesthetics. He was particularly prolific in the field of metaphysics, logic and the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of language, ethics and epistemology. When Brand Blanshard asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, though he hastened to add \"but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects\".Blanshard, in Paul Arthur Schilpp, ed., The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard, Open Court, 1980, p.\u00a088, quoting a private letter from Russell.\n\nOn ethics, Russell considered himself a utilitarian.The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p.\u00a039 (\"It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise. Belief in happiness, I found, was called Utilitarianism, and was merely one among a number of ethical theories. I adhered to it after this discovery.\").\n\nFor the advancement of science and protection of the right to freedom of expression, Russell advocated The Will to Doubt, the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:\n\nReligion\nRussell described himself in 1947 as an agnostic, saying: \"Therefore, in regard to the Olympic gods, speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the Christian God, I should, I think, take exactly the same line.\": \"I never know whether I should say \"Agnostic\" or whether I should say \"Atheist\"... As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove (sic) that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist...\" For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than superstition and, in spite of any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.'Humanist News', March 1970\n\nSociety\n\nPolitical and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes.\n\nRussell argued for a \"scientific society\", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared. He suggested the establishment of a \"single supreme world government\" able to enforce peace, claiming that \"the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation\".\n\nRussell was an active supporter of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, being one of the signatories of A. E. Dyson's 1958 letter to The Times calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.\n\nIn \"Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday\" (\"Postscript\" in his Autobiography), Russell wrote: \"I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken\".

Universe of discourse. Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 941. Many logicians distinguish, sometimes only tacitly, between the domain of a science and the universe of discourse of a formalization of the science.Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sag\u00fcillo, Domains of sciences, universe of discourse, and omega arguments, History and philosophy of logic, vol. 20 (1999), pp. 267\u2013280. Giuseppe Peano formalized number theory (arithmetic of positive integers) taking its domain to be the positive integers and the universe of discourse to include all numbers, not just integers .\n\nExamples\nFor example, in an interpretation of first-order logic, the domain of discourse is the set of individuals over which the quantifiers range. A proposition such as  is ambiguous, if no domain of discourse has been identified. In one interpretation, the domain of discourse could be the set of real numbers; in another interpretation, it could be the set of natural numbers. If the domain of discourse is the set of real numbers, the proposition is false, with  as counterexample; if the domain is the set of naturals, the proposition is true, since 2 is not the square of any natural number.\n\nUniverse of discourse\nThe term universe of discourse generally refers to the collection of objects being discussed in a specific discourse. In model-theoretical semantics, a universe of discourse is the set of entities that a model is based on. The concept universe of discourse is generally attributed to Augustus De\u00a0Morgan (1846) but the name was used for the first time by George Boole (1854) on page 42 of his Laws of Thought. Boole's definition is quoted below. The concept, probably discovered independently by Boole in 1847, played a crucial role in his philosophy of logic especially in his principle of wholistic reference.\n\nBoole\u2019s 1854 definition\nthumb|George Boole\n\nSee also\n\nDomain of a function\nDomain theory\nInterpretation (logic)\nTerm algebra\nUniverse (mathematics)\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Semantics\nCategory:Predicate logic"}
{"title": "Epsilon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon", "text": "Epsilon (uppercase , lowercase  or lunate ; ) is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, corresponding phonetically to a mid front unrounded vowel . In the system of Greek numerals it also has the value five. It was derived from the Phoenician letter He 20px|He. Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman E, \u00cb and \u0190, and Cyrillic \u0415, \u00c8, \u0401, \u0404 and \u042d.\n\nThe name of the letter was originally  (), but the name was changed to  (e psilon \"simple e\") in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter from the digraph , a former diphthong that had come to be pronounced the same as epsilon.\n\nIn essence, the uppercase form of epsilon looks identical to Latin E. The lowercase version has two typographical variants, both inherited from medieval Greek handwriting. One, the most common in modern typography and inherited from medieval minuscule, looks like a reversed \"3\". The other, also known as lunate or uncial epsilon and inherited from earlier uncial writing,Nick Nicholas: Letters, 2003\u20132008. (Greek Unicode Issues) looks like a semicircle crossed by a horizontal bar. While in normal typography these are just alternative font variants, they may have different meanings as mathematical symbols. Computer systems therefore offer distinct encodings for them. In Unicode, the character U+03F5 \"Greek lunate epsilon symbol\" (\u03f5) is provided specifically for the lunate form. In TeX, \\epsilon () denotes the lunate form, while \\varepsilon () denotes the reversed-3 form.\n\nThere is also a Latin epsilon or \"open e\", which looks similar to the Greek lowercase epsilon. It is encoded in Unicode as U+025B (\"Latin small-letter open e\", \u025b) and U+0190 (\"Latin capital-letter open e\", \u0190) and is used as an IPA phonetic symbol. The lunate or uncial epsilon has also provided inspiration for the euro sign (\u20ac).\n\nThe lunate epsilon (\u03f5) is not to be confused with the set membership symbol (\u2208); nor should the Latin uppercase epsilon (\u0190) be confused with the Greek uppercase sigma (\u03a3).  The symbol , first used in set theory and logic by Giuseppe Peano and now used in mathematics in general for set membership (\"belongs to\") did, however, evolve from the letter epsilon, since the symbol was originally used as an abbreviation for the Latin word \"est\".  In addition, mathematicians often read the symbol  as \"element of\", as in \"1 is an element of the natural numbers\" for , for example.  As late as 1960,  itself was used for set membership, while its negation \"does not belong to\" (now ) was denoted by  (epsilon prime).  Only gradually did a fully separate, stylized symbol take the place of epsilon in this role.  In a related context, Peano also introduced the use of a backwards epsilon, , for the phrase \"such that\", although the abbreviation \"s.t.\" is occasionally used in place of  in informal cardinals\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\nThe letter \u0395 was taken over from the Phoenician letter He (inline|x12px) when Greeks first adopted alphabetic writing. In archaic Greek writing, its shape is often still identical to that of the Phoenician letter. Like other Greek letters, it could face either leftward or rightward (inline|x14pxinline|x14px), depending on the current writing direction, but, just as in Phoenician, the horizontal bars always faced in the direction of writing. Archaic writing often preserves the Phoenician form with a vertical stem extending slightly below the lowest horizontal bar. In the classical era, through the influence of more cursive writing styles, the shape was simplified to the current E glyph.\n\nSound value\nWhile the original pronunciation of the Phoenician letter He was , the earliest Greek sound value of \u0395 was determined by the vowel occurring in the Phoenician letter name, which made it a natural choice for being reinterpreted from a consonant symbol to a vowel symbol denoting an  sound.Jeffery, Local scripts, p.24. Besides its classical Greek sound value, the short  phoneme, it could initially also be used for other -like sounds. For instance, in early Attic before c.500 B.C., it was used also both for the long, open , and for the long close . In the former role, it was later replaced in the classic Greek alphabet by Eta (\u0397), which was taken over from eastern Ionic alphabets, while in the latter role it was replaced by the digraph spelling \u0395\u0399.\n\nEpichoric alphabets\nSome dialects used yet other ways of distinguishing between various e-like sounds.\n\nIn Corinth, the normal function of \u0395 to denote  and  was taken by a glyph resembling a pointed B (inline|x14px), while \u0395 was used only for long close .Jeffery, Local scripts, p.114. The letter Beta, in turn, took the deviant shape inline|x14px.\n\nIn Sicyon, a variant glyph resembling an X (inline|x14px) was used in the same function as Corinthian inline|x14px.Jeffery, Local scripts, p.138.\n\nIn Thespiai (Boeotia), a special letter form consisting of a vertical stem with a single rightward-pointing horizontal bar (inline|x12px) was used for what was probably a raised variant of  in pre-vocalic environments.Jeffery, Local scripts, p.89. This tack glyph was used elsewhere also as a form of \"Heta\", i.e. for the sound .\n\nGlyph variants\nAfter the establishment of the , new glyph variants for \u0395 were introduced through handwriting. In the uncial script (used for literary papyrus manuscripts in late antiquity and then in early medieval vellum codices), the \"lunate\" shape (inline|x12px) became predominant. In cursive handwriting, a large number of shorthand glyphs came to be used, where the cross-bar and the curved stroke were linked in various ways. Some of them resembled a modern lowercase Latin \"e\", some a \"6\" with a connecting stroke to the next letter starting from the middle, and some a combination of two small \"c\"-like curves. Several of these shapes were later taken over into minuscule book hand. Of the various minuscule letter shapes, the inverted-3 form became the basis for lower-case Epsilon in Greek typography during the modern era.\n\nUncialUncial variantsCursive variantsMinusculeMinuscule with ligaturesinline|x20pxinline|x30pxinline|x30pxinline|x40pxinline|x40px\n\nUses\n\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet\nDespite its pronunciation as mid, in the International Phonetic Alphabet, the Latin epsilon  represents open-mid front unrounded vowel, as in the English word pet .\n\nSymbol\nThe uppercase Epsilon is not commonly used outside of the Greek language because of its similarity to the Latin letter E however, it is commonly used in structural mechanics with Young's Modulus equations for calculating tensile, compressive and Areal strain.\n\nThe Greek lowercase epsilon \u03b5, the lunate epsilon symbol \u03f5, or the Latin lowercase epsilon \u025b (see above) is used in a variety of places:\n\nIn engineering mechanics strain calculations \u03f5=increase of length / original length. Usually this relates to extensometer testing of metallic materials.\n\nIn mathematics (particularly calculus), an arbitrarily small positive quantity is commonly denoted \u03b5; see (\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit.\nIn reference to this, the late mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s also used the term \"epsilons\" to refer to children (Hoffman 1998, p.\u00a04).\nIn mathematics, Hilbert introduced epsilon terms  as an extension to first order logic; see epsilon calculus.\nIn mathematics, it is used to represent the Levi-Civita symbol.\nIn mathematics, it is used to represent dual numbers: a + b\u03b5, with \u03b52 = 0 and \u03b5 \u2260 0.\nIn mathematics, it is sometimes used to denote the Heaviside step function.\nIn set theory, the epsilon numbers are ordinal numbers that satisfy the fixed point \u03b5 = \u03c9\u03b5. The first epsilon number, \u03b50, is the limit ordinal of the set {\u03c9, \u03c9\u03c9, \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9, ...}.\nIn computer science, it often represents the empty string, though different writers use a variety of other symbols for the empty string as well; usually the lower-case Greek letter lambda (\u03bb).\nIn computer science, the machine epsilon indicates the upper bound on the relative error due to rounding in floating point arithmetic.\nIn physics, it indicates the permittivity of a medium; with the subscript 0 (\u03f50) it is the permittivity of free space.\nIn physics, it can also indicate the strain of a material (a ratio of extensions).\nIn automata theory, it shows a transition that involves no shifting of an input symbol.\nIn astronomy, it stands for the fifth-brightest star in a constellation (see Bayer designation).\nIn astronomy, Epsilon is the name for Uranus' most distant and most visible ring.\nIn planetary science, \u03b5 denotes the axial tilt.\nIn chemistry, it represents the molar extinction coefficient of a chromophore.\nIn economics, \u03b5 refers to elasticity.\nIn statistics, it is used to refer to error terms.\nIn statistics, it also can to refer to the degree of sphericity in repeated measures ANOVAs.\nIn agronomy, it is used to represent the \"photosynthetic efficiency\" of a particular plant or crop.\n\nUnicode\n\n Greek Epsilon\n\n Coptic Eie\n\n Latin Open E\n\n Mathematical Epsilon\n\nThese characters are used only as mathematical symbols.

{"title": "First-order logic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic", "text": "First-order logic\u2014also known as predicate logic and first-order predicate calculus\u2014is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as Socrates is a man one can have expressions in the form \"there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man\" and there exists is a quantifier while x is a variable.Hodgson, Dr. J. P. E., \"First Order Logic\", Saint Joseph's University, Philadelphia, 1995. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations;Hughes, G. E., & Cresswell, M. J., A New Introduction to Modal Logic (London: Routledge, 1996), p.161. in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.\n\nA theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse over which the quantified variables range, finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold for those things. Sometimes \"theory\" is understood in a more formal sense, which is just a set of sentences in first-order logic.\n\nThe adjective \"first-order\" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which one or both of predicate quantifiers or function quantifiers are permitted. In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.\n\nThere are many deductive systems for first-order logic which are both sound (all provable statements are true in all models) and complete (all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable, much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory, such as the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem.\n\nFirst-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms and is studied in the foundations of mathematics.\nPeano arithmetic and Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic.\nNo first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe  a structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the real line. Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, categorical axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as second-order logic.\n\nThe foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce.Eric M. Hammer: Semantics for Existential Graphs, Journal of Philosophical Logic, Volume 27, Issue 5 (October 1998), page 489: \"Development of first-order logic independently of Frege, anticipating prenex and Skolem normal forms\" For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see Jos\u00e9 Ferreir\u00f3s (2001).\n\nIntroduction\nWhile propositional logic deals with simple declarative propositions, first-order logic additionally covers predicates and quantification.\n\nA predicate takes an entity or entities in the domain of discourse as input while outputs are either True or False. Consider the two sentences \"Socrates is a philosopher\" and \"Plato is a philosopher\". In propositional logic, these sentences are viewed as being unrelated and might be denoted, for example, by variables such as p and q. The predicate \"is a philosopher\" occurs in both sentences, which have a common structure of \"a is a philosopher\". The variable a is instantiated as \"Socrates\" in the first sentence and is instantiated as \"Plato\" in the second sentence. While first-order logic allows for the use of predicates, such as \"is a philosopher\" in this example, propositional logic does not.Goertzel, B., Geisweiller, N., Coelho, L., Jani\u010di\u0107, P., & Pennachin, C., Real-World Reasoning: Toward Scalable, Uncertain Spatiotemporal, Contextual and Causal Inference (Amsterdam & Paris: Atlantis Press, 2011), p. 29.\n\nRelationships between predicates can be stated using logical connectives. Consider, for example, the first-order formula \"if a is a philosopher, then a is a scholar\". This formula is a conditional statement with \"a is a philosopher\" as its hypothesis and \"a is a scholar\" as its conclusion. The truth of this formula depends on which object is denoted by a, and on the interpretations of the predicates \"is a philosopher\" and \"is a scholar\".\n\nQuantifiers can be applied to variables in a formula. The variable a in the previous formula can be universally quantified, for instance, with the first-order sentence \"For every a, if a is a philosopher, then a is a scholar\". The universal quantifier \"for every\" in this sentence expresses the idea that the claim \"if a is a philosopher, then a is a scholar\" holds for all choices of a.\n\nThe negation of the sentence \"For every a, if a is a philosopher, then a is a scholar\" is logically equivalent to the sentence \"There exists a such that a is a philosopher and a is not a scholar\". The existential quantifier \"there exists\" expresses the idea that the claim \"a is a philosopher and a is not a scholar\" holds for some choice of a.\n\nThe predicates \"is a philosopher\" and \"is a scholar\" each take a single variable. In general, predicates can take several variables. In the first-order sentence \"Socrates is the teacher of Plato\", the predicate \"is the teacher of\" takes two variables.\n\nAn interpretation (or model) of a first-order formula specifies what each predicate means and the entities that can instantiate the variables. These entities form the domain of discourse or universe, which is usually required to be a nonempty set. For example, in an interpretation with the domain of discourse consisting of all human beings and the predicate \"is a philosopher\" understood as \"was the author of the Republic\", the sentence \"There exists a such that a is a philosopher\" is seen as being true, as witnessed by Plato.\n\nSyntax\nThere are two key parts of first-order logic. The syntax determines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in first-order logic, while the semantics determine the meanings behind these expressions.\n\nAlphabet\nUnlike natural languages, such as English, the language of first-order logic is completely formal, so that it can be mechanically determined whether a given expression is legal.  There are two key types of legal expressions: terms, which intuitively represent objects, and formulas, which intuitively express predicates that can be true or false. The terms and formulas of first-order logic are strings of symbols, where all the symbols together form the alphabet of the language. As with all formal languages, the nature of the symbols themselves is outside the scope of formal logic; they are often regarded simply as letters and punctuation symbols.\n\nIt is common to divide the symbols of the alphabet into logical symbols, which always have the same meaning, and non-logical symbols, whose meaning varies by interpretation. For example, the logical symbol  always represents \"and\"; it is never interpreted as \"or\". On the other hand, a non-logical predicate symbol such as Phil(x) could be interpreted to mean \"x is a philosopher\", \"x is a man named Philip\", or any other unary predicate, depending on the interpretation at hand.\n\nLogical symbols\nThere are several logical symbols in the alphabet, which vary by author but usually include:\n The quantifier symbols \u2200 and \u2203\n The logical connectives: \u2227 for conjunction, \u2228 for disjunction,  \u2192 for implication, \u2194 for biconditional, \u00ac for negation.  Occasionally other logical connective symbols are included.  Some authors use Cpq, instead of \u2192, and Epq, instead of \u2194, especially in contexts where \u2192 is used for other purposes. Moreover, the horseshoe \u2283 may replace \u2192; the triple-bar \u2261 may replace \u2194; a tilde (~), Np, or Fpq, may replace \u00ac; ||, or Apq may replace \u2228; and &, Kpq, or the middle dot, \u22c5, may replace \u2227, especially if these symbols are not available for technical reasons. (Note: the aforementioned symbols Cpq, Epq, Np, Apq, and Kpq are used in Polish notation.)\n Parentheses, brackets, and other punctuation symbols. The choice of such symbols varies depending on context.\n An infinite set of variables, often denoted by lowercase letters at the end of the alphabet x, y, z, ... . Subscripts are often used to distinguish variables: \n An equality symbol (sometimes, identity symbol) =; see the section on equality below.\n\nNot all of these symbols are required\u2013only one of the quantifiers, negation and conjunction, variables, brackets and equality suffice. There are numerous minor variations that may define additional logical symbols:\n Sometimes the truth constants T, Vpq, or \u22a4, for \"true\" and F, Opq, or \u22a5, for \"false\" are included. Without any such logical operators of valence 0, these two constants can only be expressed using quantifiers.\n Sometimes additional logical connectives are included, such as the Sheffer stroke, Dpq (NAND), and exclusive or, Jpq.\n\nNon-logical symbols\nThe non-logical symbols represent predicates (relations), functions and constants on the domain of discourse. It used to be standard practice to use a fixed, infinite set of non-logical symbols for all purposes. A more recent practice is to use different non-logical symbols according to the application one has in mind. Therefore, it has become necessary to name the set of all non-logical symbols used in a particular application. This choice is made via a signature.The word language is sometimes used as a synonym for signature, but this can be confusing because \"language\" can also refer to the set of formulas.\n\nThe traditional approach is to have only one, infinite, set of non-logical symbols (one signature) for all applications. Consequently, under the traditional approach there is only one language of first-order logic.More precisely, there is only one language of each variant of one-sorted first-order logic: with or without equality, with or without functions, with or without propositional variables, .... This approach is still common, especially in philosophically oriented books.\n For every integer n\u00a0\u2265\u00a00 there is a collection of n-ary, or n-place, predicate symbols. Because they represent relations between n elements, they are also called relation symbols. For each arity n we have an infinite supply of them:\nPn0, Pn1, Pn2, Pn3, ...\n For every integer n\u00a0\u2265\u00a00 there are infinitely many n-ary function symbols:\nf n0, f n1, f n2, f n3, ...\n\nIn contemporary mathematical logic, the signature varies by application. Typical signatures in mathematics are {1, \u00d7} or just {\u00d7} for groups, or {0, 1, +, \u00d7, <} for ordered fields. There are no restrictions on the number of non-logical symbols. The signature can be empty, finite, or infinite, even uncountable. Uncountable signatures occur for example in modern proofs of the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem.\n\nIn this approach, every non-logical symbol is of one of the following types.\n A predicate symbol (or relation symbol) with some valence (or arity, number of arguments) greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by uppercase letters P, Q, R,... .\n Relations of valence 0 can be identified with propositional variables. For example, P, which can stand for any statement.\n For example, P(x) is a predicate variable of valence 1. One possible interpretation is \"x is a man\".\n Q(x,y) is a predicate variable of valence 2. Possible interpretations include \"x is greater than y\" and \"x is the father of y\".\n A function symbol, with some valence greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by lowercase letters f, g, h,... .\n Examples: f(x) may be interpreted as for \"the father of x\". In arithmetic, it may stand for \"-x\". In set theory, it may stand for \"the power set of x\". In arithmetic, g(x,y) may stand for \"x+y\". In set theory, it may stand for \"the union of x and y\".\n Function symbols of valence 0 are called constant symbols, and are often denoted by lowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet a, b, c,... . The symbol a may stand for Socrates. In arithmetic, it may stand for 0. In set theory, such a constant may stand for the empty set.\n\nThe traditional approach can be recovered in the modern approach by simply specifying the \"custom\" signature to consist of the traditional sequences of non-logical symbols.\n\nFormation rules\nThe formation rules define the terms and formulas of first-order logic.Smullyan, R. M., First-order Logic (New York: Dover Publications, 1968), p. 5. When terms and formulas are represented as strings of symbols, these rules can be used to write a formal grammar for terms and formulas. These rules are generally context-free (each production has a single symbol on the left side), except that the set of symbols may be allowed to be infinite and there may be many start symbols, for example the variables in the case of terms.\n\nTerms\nThe set of terms is inductively defined by the following rules:\n Variables. Any variable is a term.\n Functions. Any expression f(t1,...,tn) of n arguments (where each argument ti is a term and f is a function symbol of valence n) is a term. In particular, symbols denoting individual constants are nullary function symbols, and are thus terms.\nOnly expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1 and 2 are terms. For example, no expression involving a predicate symbol is a term.\n\nFormulas\nThe set of formulas (also called well-formed formulasSome authors who use the term \"well-formed formula\" use \"formula\" to mean any string of symbols from the alphabet. However, most authors in mathematical logic use \"formula\" to mean \"well-formed formula\" and have no term for non-well-formed formulas. In every context, it is only the well-formed formulas that are of interest. or WFFs) is inductively defined by the following rules:\n Predicate symbols. If P is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, ..., tn are terms then P(t1,...,tn) is a formula.\n Equality. If the equality symbol is considered part of logic, and t1 and t2 are terms, then t1 = t2 is a formula.\n Negation. If \u03c6 is a formula, then \u03c6 is a formula.\n Binary connectives. If \u03c6 and \u03c8 are formulas, then (\u03c6  \u03c8) is a formula. Similar rules apply to other binary logical connectives.\n Quantifiers. If   is a formula and x is a variable, then  (for all x,  holds) and  (there exists x such that ) are formulas.\nOnly expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1\u20135 are formulas. The formulas obtained from the first two rules are said to be atomic formulas.\n\nFor example,\n\nis a formula, if f is a unary function symbol, P a unary predicate symbol, and Q a ternary predicate symbol. On the other hand,  is not a formula, although it is a string of symbols from the alphabet.\n\nThe role of the parentheses in the definition is to ensure that any formula can only be obtained in one way by following the inductive definition (in other words, there is a unique parse tree for each formula). This property is known as unique readability of formulas. There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas. For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, or change the places in which parentheses are inserted. Each author's particular definition must be accompanied by a proof of unique readability.\n\nThis definition of a formula does not support defining an if-then-else function ite(c, a, b), where \"c\" is a condition expressed as a formula, that would return \"a\" if c is true, and \"b\" if it is false. This is because both predicates and functions can only accept terms as parameters, but the first parameter is a formula.  Some languages built on first-order logic, such as SMT-LIB 2.0, add this.\n\nNotational conventions\nFor convenience, conventions have been developed about the precedence of the logical operators, to avoid the need to write parentheses in some cases. These rules are similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. A common convention is:\n  is evaluated first\n  and  are evaluated next\n Quantifiers are evaluated next\n  is evaluated last.\nMoreover, extra punctuation not required by the definition may be inserted to make formulas easier to read. Thus the formula\n\nmight be written as\n\nIn some fields, it is common to use infix notation for binary relations and functions, instead of the prefix notation defined above. For example, in arithmetic, one typically writes \"2 + 2 = 4\" instead of \"=(+(2,2),4)\". It is common to regard formulas in infix notation as abbreviations for the corresponding formulas in prefix notation, cf. also term structure vs. representation.\n\nThe definitions above use infix notation for binary connectives such as . A less common convention is Polish notation, in which one writes , , and so on in front of their arguments rather than between them. This convention allows all punctuation symbols to be discarded. Polish notation is compact and elegant, but rarely used in practice because it is hard for humans to read it. In Polish notation, the formula\n\nbecomes \n\nFree and bound variables\n\nIn a formula, a variable may occur free or bound (or both). Intuitively, a variable occurrence is free in a formula if it is not quantified: in , the sole occurrence of variable x is free while that of y is bound. The free and bound variable occurrences in a formula are defined inductively as follows.\n Atomic formulas. If \u03c6 is an atomic formula then x occurs free in \u03c6 if and only if x occurs in \u03c6. Moreover, there are no bound variables in any atomic formula.\n Negation. x occurs free in \u03c6 if and only if x occurs free in \u03c6. x occurs bound in \u03c6 if and only if x occurs bound in \u03c6.\n Binary connectives. x occurs free in (\u03c6  \u03c8) if and only if x occurs free in either \u03c6 or \u03c8. x occurs bound in (\u03c6  \u03c8) if and only if x occurs bound in either \u03c6 or \u03c8. The same rule applies to any other binary connective in place of .\n Quantifiers. x occurs free in y \u03c6 if and only if x occurs free in \u03c6 and x is a different symbol from y. Also, x occurs bound in y \u03c6 if and only if x is y or x occurs bound in \u03c6.  The same rule holds with  in place of .\n\nFor example, in x y (P(x) Q(x,f(x),z)), x and y occur only bound,y occurs bound by rule 4, although it doesn't appear in any atomic subformula  z occurs only free, and w is neither because it does not occur in the formula.\n\nFree and bound variables of a formula need not be disjoint sets: in the formula , the first occurrence of x, as argument of P, is free while the second one, as argument of Q, is bound.\n\nA formula in first-order logic with no free variable occurrences is called a first-order sentence. These are the formulas that will have well-defined truth values under an interpretation. For example, whether a formula such as Phil(x) is true must depend on what x represents. But the sentence  will be either true or false in a given interpretation.\n\nExample: ordered abelian groups\nIn mathematics the language of ordered abelian groups has one constant symbol 0, one unary function symbol \u2212, one binary function symbol +, and one binary relation symbol \u2264. Then:\nThe expressions +(x, y) and +(x, +(y, \u2212(z))) are terms. These are usually written as x + y and x + y \u2212 z.\nThe expressions +(x, y) = 0 and \u2264(+(x, +(y, \u2212(z))), +(x, y)) are atomic formulas. These are usually written as x + y = 0 and x + y \u2212 z \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 x + y.\nThe expression  is a formula, which is usually written as  This formula has one free variable, z.\n\nThe axioms for ordered abelian groups can be expressed as a set of sentences in the language. For example, the axiom stating that the group is commutative is usually written \n\nSemantics\nAn interpretation of a first-order language assigns a denotation to each non-logical symbol in that language. It also determines a domain of discourse that specifies the range of the quantifiers. The result is that each term is assigned an object that it represents, each predicate is assigned a property of objects, and each sentence is assigned a truth value. In this way, an interpretation provides semantic meaning to the terms, the predicates, and formulas of the language. The study of the interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics. What follows is a description of the standard or Tarskian semantics for first-order logic. (It is also possible to define game semantics for first-order logic, but aside from requiring the axiom of choice, game semantics agree with Tarskian semantics for first-order logic, so game semantics will not be elaborated herein.)\n\nThe domain of discourse D is a nonempty set of \"objects\" of some kind. Intuitively, a first-order formula is a statement about these objects; for example,  states the existence of an object x such that the predicate P is true where referred to it. The domain of discourse is the set of considered objects. For example, one can take  to be the set of integer numbers.\n\nThe interpretation of a function symbol is a function. For example, if the domain of discourse consists of integers, a function symbol f of arity 2 can be interpreted as the function that gives the sum of its arguments. In other words, the symbol f is associated with the function I(f) which, in this interpretation, is addition.\n\nThe interpretation of a constant symbol is a function from the one-element set D0 to D, which can be simply identified with an object in D. For example, an interpretation may assign the value  to the constant symbol .\n\nThe interpretation of an n-ary predicate symbol is a set of n-tuples of elements of the domain of discourse. This means that, given an interpretation, a predicate symbol, and n elements of the domain of discourse, one can tell whether the predicate is true of those elements according to the given interpretation. For example, an interpretation I(P) of a binary predicate symbol P may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate P would be true if its first argument is less than the second.\n\nFirst-order structures\n\nThe most common way of specifying an interpretation (especially in mathematics) is to specify a structure (also called a model; see below). The structure consists of a nonempty set D that forms the domain of discourse and an interpretation I of the non-logical terms of the signature.  This interpretation is itself a function:\n Each function symbol f of arity n is assigned a function I(f) from  to . In particular, each constant symbol of the signature is assigned an individual in the domain of discourse.\n Each predicate symbol P of arity n is assigned a relation I(P) over  or, equivalently, a function from  to . Thus each predicate symbol is interpreted by a Boolean-valued function on D.\n\nEvaluation of truth values\nA formula evaluates to true or false given an interpretation, and a variable assignment \u03bc that associates an element of the domain of discourse with each variable. The reason that a variable assignment is required is to give meanings to formulas with free variables, such as . The truth value of this formula changes depending on whether x and y denote the same individual.\n\nFirst, the variable assignment \u03bc can be extended to all terms of the language, with the result that each term maps to a single element of the domain of discourse. The following rules are used to make this assignment:\n Variables. Each variable x evaluates to \u03bc(x)\n Functions. Given terms  that have been evaluated to elements  of the domain of discourse, and a n-ary function symbol f, the term  evaluates to .\n\nNext, each formula is assigned a truth value. The inductive definition used to make this assignment is called the T-schema.\n Atomic formulas (1). A formula  is associated the value true or false depending on whether , where  are the evaluation of the terms  and  is the interpretation of , which by assumption is a subset of .\n Atomic formulas (2). A formula  is assigned true if  and  evaluate to the same object of the domain of discourse (see the section on equality below).\n Logical connectives. A formula in the form , , etc. is evaluated according to the truth table for the connective in question, as in propositional logic.\n Existential quantifiers. A formula  is true according to M and  if there exists an evaluation  of the variables that only differs from  regarding the evaluation of x and such that \u03c6 is true according to the interpretation M and the variable assignment . This formal definition captures the idea that  is true if and only if there is a way to choose a value for x such that \u03c6(x) is satisfied.\n Universal quantifiers. A formula  is true according to M and  if \u03c6(x) is true for every pair composed by the interpretation M and some variable assignment  that differs from  only on the value of x. This captures the idea that  is true if every possible choice of a value for x causes \u03c6(x) to be true.\n\nIf a formula does not contain free variables, and so is a sentence, then the initial variable assignment does not affect its truth value. In other words, a sentence is true according to M and  if and only if it is true according to M and every other variable assignment .\n\nThere is a second common approach to defining truth values that does not rely on variable assignment functions. Instead, given an interpretation M, one first adds to the signature a collection of constant symbols, one for each element of the domain of discourse in M; say that for each d in the domain the constant symbol cd is fixed. The interpretation is extended so that each new constant symbol is assigned to its corresponding element of the domain. One now defines truth for quantified formulas syntactically, as follows:\n Existential quantifiers (alternate). A formula  is true according to M if there is some d in the domain of discourse such that  holds. Here  is the result of substituting  cd for every free occurrence of x in \u03c6.\n Universal quantifiers (alternate). A formula  is true according to M if, for every d in the domain of discourse,  is true according to M.\nThis alternate approach gives exactly the same truth values to all sentences as the approach via variable assignments.\n\nValidity, satisfiability, and logical consequence\n\nIf a sentence \u03c6 evaluates to True under a given interpretation M, one says that M satisfies \u03c6; this is denoted . A sentence is satisfiable if there is some interpretation under which it is true.\n\nSatisfiability of formulas with free variables is more complicated, because an interpretation on its own does not determine the truth value of such a formula. The most common convention is that a formula with free variables is said to be satisfied by an interpretation if the formula remains true regardless which individuals from the domain of discourse are assigned to its free variables. This has the same effect as saying that a formula is satisfied if and only if its universal closure is satisfied.\n\nA formula is logically valid (or simply valid) if it is true in every interpretation. These formulas play a role similar to tautologies in propositional logic.\n\nA formula \u03c6 is a logical consequence of a formula \u03c8 if every interpretation that makes \u03c8 true also makes \u03c6 true. In this case one says that \u03c6 is logically implied by \u03c8.\n\nAlgebraizations\nAn alternate approach to the semantics of first-order logic proceeds via abstract algebra. This approach generalizes the  Lindenbaum\u2013Tarski algebras of propositional logic.  There are three ways of eliminating quantified variables from first-order logic that do not involve replacing quantifiers with other variable binding term operators:\nCylindric algebra, by Alfred Tarski and his coworkers;\nPolyadic algebra, by Paul Halmos;\nPredicate functor logic, mainly due to Willard Quine.\nThese algebras are all lattices that properly extend the two-element Boolean algebra.\n\nTarski and Givant (1987) showed that the fragment of first-order logic that has no atomic sentence lying in the scope of more than three quantifiers has the same expressive power as relation algebra. This fragment is of great interest because it suffices for Peano arithmetic and most axiomatic set theory, including the canonical ZFC. They also prove that first-order logic with a primitive ordered pair is equivalent to a relation algebra with two ordered pair projection functions.\n\nFirst-order theories, models, and elementary classes\nA first-order theory of a particular signature is a set of axioms, which are sentences consisting of symbols from that signature. The set of axioms is often finite or recursively enumerable, in which case the theory is called effective. Some authors require theories to also include all logical consequences of the axioms. The axioms are considered to hold within the theory and from them other sentences that hold within the theory can be derived.\n\nA first-order structure that satisfies all sentences in a given theory is said to be a model of the theory. An elementary class is the set of all structures satisfying a particular theory. These classes are a main subject of study in model theory.\n\nMany theories have an intended interpretation, a certain model that is kept in mind when studying the theory. For example, the intended interpretation of Peano arithmetic consists of the usual natural numbers with their usual operations. However, the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows that most first-order theories will also have other, nonstandard models.\n\nA theory is consistent if it is not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory. A theory is complete if, for every formula in its signature, either that formula or its negation is a logical consequence of the axioms of the theory. G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem shows that effective first-order theories that include a sufficient portion of the theory of the natural numbers can never be both consistent and complete.\n\nFor more information on this subject see List of first-order theories and Theory (mathematical logic)\n\nEmpty domains\n\nThe definition above requires that the domain of discourse of any interpretation must be nonempty. There are settings, such as inclusive logic, where empty domains are permitted. Moreover, if a class of algebraic structures includes an empty structure (for example, there is an empty poset), that class can only be an elementary class in first-order logic if empty domains are permitted or the empty structure is removed from the class.\n\nThere are several difficulties with empty domains, however:\n Many common rules of inference are only valid when the domain of discourse is required to be nonempty. One example is the rule stating that  implies  when x is not a free variable in . This rule, which is used to put formulas into prenex normal form, is sound in nonempty domains, but unsound if the empty domain is permitted.\n The definition of truth in an interpretation that uses a variable assignment function cannot work with empty domains, because there are no variable assignment functions whose range is empty. (Similarly, one cannot assign interpretations to constant symbols.) This truth definition requires that one must select a variable assignment function (\u03bc above) before truth values for even atomic formulas can be defined. Then the truth value of a sentence is defined to be its truth value under any variable assignment, and it is proved that this truth value does not depend on which assignment is chosen. This technique does not work if there are no assignment functions at all; it must be changed to accommodate empty domains.\nThus, when the empty domain is permitted, it must often be treated as a special case. Most authors, however, simply exclude the empty domain by definition.\n\nDeductive systems\nA deductive system is used to demonstrate, on a purely syntactic basis, that one formula is a logical consequence of another formula. There are many such systems for first-order logic, including Hilbert-style deductive systems, natural deduction, the sequent calculus, the tableaux method, and resolution. These share the common property that a deduction is a finite syntactic object; the format of this object, and the way it is constructed, vary widely.  These finite deductions themselves are often called derivations in proof theory. They are also often called proofs, but are completely formalized unlike natural-language mathematical proofs.\n\nA deductive system is sound if any formula that can be derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a deductive system is complete if every logically valid formula is derivable. All of the systems discussed in this article are both sound and complete. They also share the property that it is possible to effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called effective.\n\nA key property of deductive systems is that they are purely syntactic, so that derivations can be verified without considering any interpretation. Thus a sound argument is correct in every possible interpretation of the language, regardless whether that interpretation is about mathematics, economics, or some other area.\n\nIn general, logical consequence in first-order logic is only semidecidable: if a sentence A logically implies a sentence B then this can be discovered (for example, by searching for a proof until one is found, using some effective, sound, complete proof system). However, if A does not logically imply B, this does not mean that A logically implies the negation of B. There is no effective procedure that, given formulas A and B, always correctly decides whether A logically implies B.\n\nRules of inference\n\nA rule of inference states that, given a particular formula (or set of formulas) with a certain property as a hypothesis, another specific formula (or set of formulas) can be derived as a conclusion. The rule is sound (or truth-preserving) if it preserves validity in the sense that whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis, that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion.\n\nFor example, one common rule of inference is the rule of substitution. If t is a term and \u03c6 is a formula possibly containing the variable x, then \u03c6[t/x] is the result of replacing all free instances of x by t in \u03c6. The substitution rule states that for any \u03c6 and any term t, one can conclude \u03c6[t/x] from \u03c6 provided that no free variable of t becomes bound during the substitution process. (If some free variable of t becomes bound, then to substitute t for x it is first necessary to change the bound variables of \u03c6 to differ from the free variables of t.)\n\nTo see why the restriction on bound variables is necessary, consider the logically valid formula \u03c6 given by , in the signature of (0,1,+,\u00d7,=) of arithmetic. If t is the term \"x + 1\", the formula \u03c6[t/y] is , which will be false in many interpretations. The problem is that the free variable x of t  became bound during the substitution. The intended replacement can be obtained by renaming the bound variable x of \u03c6 to something else, say z, so that the formula after substitution is , which is again logically valid.\n\nThe substitution rule demonstrates several common aspects of rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; one can tell whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, as is often the case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.\n\nHilbert-style systems and natural deduction\nA deduction in a Hilbert-style deductive system is a list of formulas, each of which is a logical axiom, a hypothesis that has been assumed for the derivation at hand, or follows from previous formulas via a rule of inference. The logical axioms consist of several axiom schemas of logically valid formulas; these encompass a significant amount of propositional logic. The rules of inference enable the manipulation of quantifiers. Typical Hilbert-style systems have a small number of rules of inference, along with several infinite schemas of logical axioms. It is common to have only modus ponens and universal generalization as rules of inference.\n\nNatural deduction systems resemble Hilbert-style systems in that a deduction is a finite list of formulas. However, natural deduction systems have no logical axioms; they compensate by adding additional rules of inference that can be used to manipulate the logical connectives in formulas in the proof.\n\nSequent calculus\n\nThe sequent calculus was developed to study the properties of natural deduction systems. Instead of working with one formula at a time, it uses  sequents, which are expressions of the form\n\nwhere A1, ..., An, B1, ..., Bk are formulas and the turnstile symbol  is used as punctuation to separate the two halves. Intuitively, a sequent expresses the idea that  implies .\n\nTableaux method\nthumb|right|150px|A tableaux proof for the propositional formula \n\nUnlike the methods just described, the derivations in the tableaux method are not lists of formulas. Instead, a derivation is a tree of formulas. To show that a formula A is provable, the tableaux method attempts to demonstrate that the negation of A is unsatisfiable. The tree of the derivation has  at its root; the tree branches in a way that reflects the structure of the formula. For example, to show that  is unsatisfiable requires showing that C and D are each unsatisfiable; this corresponds to a branching point in the tree with parent  and children C and D.\n\nResolution\nThe resolution rule is a single rule of inference that, together with unification, is sound and complete for first-order logic. As with the tableaux method, a formula is proved by showing that the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable. Resolution is commonly used in automated theorem proving.\n\nThe resolution method works only with formulas that are disjunctions of atomic formulas; arbitrary formulas must first be converted to this form through Skolemization. The resolution rule states that from the hypotheses  and , the conclusion  can be obtained.\n\nProvable identities\nMany identities can be proved, which establish equivalences between particular formulas. These identities allow for rearranging formulas by moving quantifiers across other connectives, and are useful for putting formulas in prenex normal form. Some provable identities include:\n\n (where  must not occur free in )\n (where  must not occur free in )\n\nEquality and its axioms\nThere are several different conventions for using equality (or identity) in first-order logic. The most common convention, known as first-order logic with equality, includes the equality symbol as a primitive logical symbol which is always interpreted as the real equality relation between members of the domain of discourse, such that the \"two\" given members are the same member. This approach also adds certain axioms about equality to the deductive system employed. These equality axioms are:\n Reflexivity. For each variable x, x = x.\n Substitution for functions. For all variables x and y, and any function symbol f,\nx = y \u2192 f(...,x,...) = f(...,y,...).\n Substitution for formulas. For any variables x and y and any formula \u03c6(x), if \u03c6' is obtained by replacing any number of free occurrences of x in \u03c6 with y, such that these remain free occurrences of y, then\nx = y \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6').\n\nThese are axiom schemas, each of which specifies an infinite set of axioms. The third schema is known as Leibniz's law, \"the principle of substitutivity\", \"the indiscernibility of identicals\", or \"the replacement property\". The second schema, involving the function symbol f, is (equivalent to) a special case of the third schema, using the formula\nx = y \u2192 (f(...,x,...) = z \u2192 f(...,y,...) = z).\n\nMany other properties of equality are consequences of the axioms above, for example:\n Symmetry. If x = y then y = x.\n Transitivity. If x = y and y = z then x = z.\n\nFirst-order logic without equality\nAn alternate approach considers the equality relation to be a non-logical symbol. This convention is known as first-order logic without equality. If an equality relation is included in the signature, the axioms of equality must now be added to the theories under consideration, if desired, instead of being considered rules of logic. The main difference between this method and first-order logic with equality is that an interpretation may now interpret two distinct individuals as \"equal\" (although, by Leibniz's law, these will satisfy exactly the same formulas under any interpretation). That is, the equality relation may now be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation on the domain of discourse that is congruent with respect to the functions and relations of the interpretation.\n\nWhen this second convention is followed, the term normal model is used to refer to an interpretation where no distinct individuals a and b satisfy a = b. In first-order logic with equality, only normal models are considered, and so there is no term for a model other than a normal model. When first-order logic without equality is studied, it is necessary to amend the statements of results such as the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem so that only normal models are considered.\n\nFirst-order logic without equality is often employed in the context of second-order arithmetic and other higher-order theories of arithmetic, where the equality relation between sets of natural numbers is usually omitted.\n\nDefining equality within a theory\nIf a theory has a binary formula A(x,y) which satisfies reflexivity and Leibniz's law, the theory is said to have equality, or to be a theory with equality. The theory may not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms, but rather as derivable theorems. For example, in theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations, it is possible to define equality in terms of the relations, by defining the two terms s and t to be equal if any relation is unchanged by changing s to t in any argument.\n\nSome theories allow other ad hoc definitions of equality:\n In the theory of partial orders with one relation symbol \u2264, one could define s = t to be an abbreviation for s \u2264 t  t \u2264 s.\n In set theory with one relation , one may define s = t to be an abbreviation for x (s  x  t  x)  x (x  s  x   t). This definition of equality then automatically satisfies the axioms for equality. In this case, one should replace the usual axiom of extensionality, which can be stated as , with an alternative formulation , which says that if  sets x and y have the same elements, then they also belong to the same sets.\n\nMetalogical properties\nOne motivation for the use of first-order logic, rather than higher-order logic, is that first-order logic has many metalogical properties that stronger logics do not have. These results concern general properties of first-order logic itself, rather than properties of individual theories. They provide fundamental tools for the construction of models of first-order theories.\n\nCompleteness and undecidability\nG\u00f6del's completeness theorem, proved by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1929, establishes that there are sound, complete, effective deductive systems for first-order logic, and thus the first-order logical consequence relation is captured by finite provability. Naively, the statement that a formula \u03c6 logically implies a formula \u03c8 depends on every model of \u03c6; these models will in general be of arbitrarily large cardinality, and so logical consequence cannot be effectively verified by checking every model. However, it is possible to enumerate all finite derivations and search for a derivation of \u03c8 from \u03c6. If \u03c8 is logically implied by \u03c6, such a derivation will eventually be found. Thus first-order logical consequence is semidecidable: it is possible to make an effective enumeration of all pairs of sentences (\u03c6,\u03c8) such that \u03c8 is a logical consequence of\u00a0\u03c6.\n\nUnlike propositional logic, first-order logic is undecidable (although semidecidable), provided that the language has at least one predicate of arity at least 2 (other than equality). This means that there is no decision procedure that determines whether arbitrary formulas are logically valid. This result was established independently by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in 1936 and 1937, respectively, giving a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Their proofs demonstrate a connection between the unsolvability of the decision problem for first-order logic and the unsolvability of the halting problem.\n\nThere are systems weaker than full first-order logic for which the logical consequence relation is decidable. These include propositional logic and monadic predicate logic, which is first-order logic restricted to unary predicate symbols and no function symbols. Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the guarded fragment of first-order logic, as well as two-variable logic. The Bernays\u2013Sch\u00f6nfinkel class of first-order formulas is also decidable. Decidable subsets of first-order logic are also studied in the framework of description logics.\n\nThe L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem\nThe L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows that if a first-order theory of cardinality \u03bb has an infinite model, then it has models of every infinite cardinality greater than or equal to \u03bb. One of the earliest results in model theory, it implies that it is not possible to characterize countability or uncountability in a first-order language with a countable signature. That is, there is no first-order formula \u03c6(x) such that an arbitrary structure M satisfies \u03c6 if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable (or, in the second case, uncountable).\n\nThe L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem implies that infinite structures cannot be categorically axiomatized in first-order logic. For example, there is no first-order theory whose only model is the real line: any first-order theory with an infinite model also has a model of cardinality larger than the continuum. Since the real line is infinite, any theory satisfied by the real line is also satisfied by some nonstandard models. When the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem is applied to first-order set theories, the nonintuitive consequences are known as Skolem's paradox.\n\nThe compactness theorem\nThe compactness theorem states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model.Hodel, R. E., An Introduction to Mathematical Logic (Mineola NY: Dover, 1995), p. 199. This implies that if a formula is a logical consequence of an infinite set of first-order axioms, then it is a logical consequence of some finite number of those axioms. This theorem was proved first by Kurt G\u00f6del as a consequence of the completeness theorem, but many additional proofs have been obtained over time. It is a central tool in model theory, providing a fundamental method for constructing models.\n\nThe compactness theorem has a limiting effect on which collections of first-order structures are elementary classes. For example, the compactness theorem implies that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models has an infinite model. Thus the class of all finite graphs is not an elementary class (the same holds for many other algebraic structures).\n\nThere are also more subtle limitations of first-order logic that are implied by the compactness theorem. For example, in computer science, many situations can be modeled as a directed graph of states (nodes) and connections (directed edges).  Validating such a system may require showing that no \"bad\" state can be reached from any \"good\" state. Thus one seeks to determine if the good and bad states are in different connected components of the graph. However, the compactness theorem can be used to show that connected graphs are not an elementary class in first-order logic, and there is no formula \u03c6(x,y) of first-order logic, in the logic of graphs, that expresses the idea that there is a path from x to y. Connectedness can be expressed in second-order logic, however, but not with only existential set quantifiers, as  also enjoys compactness.\n\nLindstr\u00f6m's theorem\n\nPer Lindstr\u00f6m showed that the metalogical properties just discussed actually characterize first-order logic in the sense that no stronger logic can also have those properties (Ebbinghaus and Flum 1994, Chapter XIII). Lindstr\u00f6m defined a class of abstract logical systems, and a rigorous definition of the relative strength of a member of this class. He established two theorems for systems of this type:\n A logical system satisfying Lindstr\u00f6m's definition that contains first-order logic and satisfies both the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.\n A logical system satisfying Lindstr\u00f6m's definition that has a semidecidable logical consequence relation and satisfies the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.\n\nLimitations\nAlthough first-order logic is sufficient for formalizing much of mathematics, and is commonly used in computer science and other fields, it has certain limitations. These include limitations on its expressiveness and limitations of the fragments of natural languages that it can describe.\n\nFor instance, first-order logic is undecidable, meaning a sound, complete and terminating decision algorithm for provability is impossible. This has led to the study of interesting decidable fragments such as C2, first-order logic with two variables and the counting quantifiers  and  (these quantifiers are, respectively, \"there exists at least n\" and \"there exists at most n\").\n\nExpressiveness\nThe L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows that if a first-order theory has any infinite model, then it has infinite models of every cardinality. In particular, no first-order theory with an infinite model can be categorical. Thus there is no first-order theory whose only model has the set of natural numbers as its domain, or whose only model has the set of real numbers as its domain.  Many extensions of first-order logic, including infinitary logics and higher-order logics, are more expressive in the sense that they do permit categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers or real numbers. This expressiveness comes at a metalogical cost, however: by Lindstr\u00f6m's theorem, the compactness theorem and the downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem cannot hold in any logic stronger than first-order.\n\nFormalizing natural languages\nFirst-order logic is able to formalize many simple quantifier constructions in natural language, such as \"every person who lives in Perth lives in Australia\". But there are many more complicated features of natural language that cannot be expressed in (single-sorted) first-order logic. \"Any logical system which is appropriate as an instrument for the analysis of natural language needs a much richer structure than first-order predicate logic\".\n\n Type  Example  Comment Quantification over properties If John is self-satisfied, then there is at least one thing he has in common with Peter   Requires a quantifier over predicates, which cannot be implemented in single-sorted first-order logic: Zj\u2192 \u2203X(Xj\u2227Xp) Quantification over properties  Santa Claus has all the attributes of a sadist  Requires quantifiers over predicates, which cannot be implemented in single-sorted first-order logic: \u2200X(\u2200x(Sx \u2192 Xx)\u2192Xs) Predicate adverbial  John is walking quickly  Cannot be analysed as Wj \u2227 Qj; predicate adverbials are not the same kind of thing as second-order predicates such as colour Relative adjective Jumbo is a small elephant  Cannot be analysed as Sj \u2227 Ej; predicate adjectives are not the same kind of thing as second-order predicates such as colour Predicate adverbial modifier  John is walking very quickly  - Relative adjective modifier  Jumbo is terribly small  An expression such as \"terribly\", when applied to a relative adjective such as \"small\", results in a new composite relative adjective \"terribly small\" Prepositions  Mary is sitting next to John  The preposition \"next to\" when applied to \"John\" results in the predicate adverbial \"next to John\"\n\nRestrictions, extensions, and variations\nThere are many variations of first-order logic. Some of these are inessential in the sense that they merely change notation without affecting the semantics. Others change the expressive power more significantly, by extending the semantics through additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols. For example, infinitary logics permit formulas of infinite size, and modal logics add symbols for possibility and necessity.\n\nRestricted languages\nFirst-order logic can be studied in languages with fewer logical symbols than were described above.\n Because  can be expressed as , and  can be expressed as , either of the two quantifiers  and  can be dropped.\n Since  can be expressed as  and  can be expressed as , either  or  can be dropped. In other words, it is sufficient to have  and , or  and , as the only logical connectives.\n Similarly, it is sufficient to have only  and  as logical connectives, or to have only the Sheffer stroke (NAND) or the Peirce arrow (NOR) operator.\n It is possible to entirely avoid function symbols and constant symbols, rewriting them via predicate symbols in an appropriate way. For example, instead of using a constant symbol   one may use a predicate    (interpreted as  ), and replace every predicate such as  with . A function such as  will similarly be replaced by a predicate   interpreted as . This change requires adding additional axioms to the theory at hand, so that interpretations of the predicate symbols used have the correct semantics.Left-totality can be expressed by an axiom ; right-uniqueness by , provided the equality symbol is admitted. Both also apply to constant replacements (for ).\n\nRestrictions such as these are useful as a technique to reduce the number of inference rules or axiom schemas in deductive systems, which leads to shorter proofs of metalogical results. The cost of the restrictions is that it becomes more difficult to express natural-language statements in the formal system at hand, because the logical connectives used in the natural language statements must be replaced by their (longer) definitions in terms of the restricted collection of logical connectives. Similarly, derivations in the limited systems may be longer than derivations in systems that include additional connectives. There is thus a trade-off between the ease of working within the formal system and the ease of proving results about the formal system.\n\nIt is also possible to restrict the arities of function symbols and predicate symbols, in sufficiently expressive theories. One can in principle dispense entirely with functions of arity greater than 2 and predicates of arity greater than 1 in theories that include a pairing function. This is a function of arity 2 that takes pairs of elements of the domain and returns an ordered pair containing them. It is also sufficient to have two predicate symbols of arity 2 that define projection functions from an ordered pair to its components. In either case it is necessary that the natural axioms for a pairing function and its projections are satisfied.\n\nMany-sorted logic\n\nOrdinary first-order interpretations have a single domain of discourse over which all quantifiers range. Many-sorted first-order logic allows variables to have different sorts, which have different domains. This is also called typed first-order logic, and the sorts called types (as in data type), but it is not the same as first-order type theory. Many-sorted first-order logic is often used in the study of second-order arithmetic. See in particular section 3.2, Many-Sorted Quantification.\n\nWhen there are only finitely many sorts in a theory, many-sorted first-order logic can be reduced to single-sorted first-order logic.Herbert Enderton. \"A Mathematical Introduction to Logic\" (2nd Edition). Academic Press, 2001, pp.296-299. \nOne introduces into the single-sorted theory a unary predicate symbol for each sort in the many-sorted theory, and adds an axiom saying that these unary predicates partition the domain of discourse. For example, if there are two sorts, one adds predicate symbols  and  and the axiom\n.\nThen the elements satisfying  are thought of as elements of the first sort, and elements satisfying  as elements of the second sort. One can quantify over each sort by using the corresponding predicate symbol to limit the range of quantification. For example, to say there is an element of the first sort satisfying formula \u03c6(x), one writes\n.\n\nAdditional quantifiers\nAdditional quantifiers can be added to first-order logic.\n Sometimes it is useful to say that \"P(x) holds for exactly one x\", which can be expressed as x P(x).  This notation, called uniqueness quantification, may be taken to abbreviate a formula such as x (P(x)  y (P(y)  (x = y))).\nFirst-order logic with extra quantifiers has new quantifiers Qx,..., with meanings such as \"there are many x such that ...\". Also see branching quantifiers and the plural quantifiers of George Boolos and others.\n Bounded quantifiers are often used in the study of set theory or arithmetic.\n\nInfinitary logics\n\nInfinitary logic allows infinitely long sentences. For example, one may allow a conjunction or disjunction of infinitely many formulas, or quantification over infinitely many variables. Infinitely long sentences arise in areas of mathematics including  topology and model theory.\n\nInfinitary logic generalizes first-order logic to allow formulas of infinite length. The most common way in which formulas can become infinite is through infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. However, it is also possible to admit generalized signatures in which function and relation symbols are allowed to have infinite arities, or in which quantifiers can bind infinitely many variables. Because an infinite formula cannot be represented by a finite string, it is necessary to choose some other representation of formulas; the usual representation in this context is a tree. Thus formulas are, essentially, identified with their parse trees, rather than with the strings being parsed.\n\nThe most commonly studied infinitary logics are denoted L\u03b1\u03b2, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are each either cardinal numbers or the symbol \u221e. In this notation, ordinary first-order logic is L\u03c9\u03c9.\nIn the logic L\u221e\u03c9, arbitrary conjunctions or disjunctions are allowed when building formulas, and there is an unlimited supply of variables. More generally, the logic that permits conjunctions or disjunctions with less than \u03ba constituents is known as L\u03ba\u03c9. For example, L\u03c91\u03c9 permits countable conjunctions and disjunctions.\n\nThe set of free variables in a formula of L\u03ba\u03c9 can have any cardinality strictly less than \u03ba, yet only finitely many of them can be in the scope of any quantifier when a formula appears as a subformula of another.Some authors only admit formulas with finitely many free variables in L\u03ba\u03c9, and more generally only formulas with <\u00a0\u03bb free variables in L\u03ba\u03bb. In other infinitary logics, a subformula may be in the scope of infinitely many quantifiers. For example, in L\u03ba\u221e, a single universal or existential quantifier may bind arbitrarily many variables simultaneously. Similarly, the logic L\u03ba\u03bb permits simultaneous quantification over fewer than \u03bb variables, as well as conjunctions and disjunctions of size less than \u03ba.\n\nNon-classical and modal logics\nIntuitionistic first-order logic uses intuitionistic rather than classical propositional calculus; for example, \u00ac\u00ac\u03c6 need not be equivalent to \u03c6.\nFirst-order modal logic allows one to describe other possible worlds as well as this contingently true world which we inhabit. In some versions, the set of possible worlds varies depending on which possible world one inhabits. Modal logic has extra modal operators with meanings which can be characterized informally as, for example  \"it is necessary that \u03c6\" (true in all possible worlds) and \"it is possible that \u03c6\" (true in some possible world). With standard first-order logic we have a single domain and each predicate is assigned one extension. With first-order modal logic we have a domain function that assigns each possible world its own domain, so that each predicate gets an extension only relative to these possible worlds. This allows us to model cases where, for example, Alex is a Philosopher, but might have been a Mathematician, and might not have existed at all. In the first possible world P(a) is true, in the second P(a) is false, and in the third possible world there is no a in the domain at all.\nfirst-order fuzzy logics are first-order extensions of propositional fuzzy logics rather than classical propositional calculus.\n\nFixpoint logic\nFixpoint logic extends first-order logic by adding the closure under the least fixed points of positive operators.\n\nHigher-order logics\n\nThe characteristic feature of first-order logic is that individuals can be quantified, but not predicates. Thus\n\nis a legal first-order formula, but\n\nis not, in most formalizations of first-order logic. Second-order logic extends first-order logic by adding the latter type of quantification. Other higher-order logics allow quantification over even higher types than second-order logic permits. These higher types include relations between relations, functions from relations to relations between relations, and other higher-type objects.  Thus the \"first\" in first-order logic describes the type of objects that can be quantified.\n\nUnlike first-order logic, for which only one semantics is studied, there are several possible semantics for second-order logic. The most commonly employed semantics for second-order and higher-order logic is known as full semantics. The combination of additional quantifiers and the full semantics for these quantifiers makes higher-order logic stronger than first-order logic. In particular, the (semantic) logical consequence relation for second-order and higher-order logic is not semidecidable; there is no effective deduction system for second-order logic that is sound and complete under full semantics.\n\nSecond-order logic with full semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, it is possible to create axiom systems in second-order logic that uniquely characterize the natural numbers and the real line. The cost of this expressiveness is that second-order and higher-order logics have fewer attractive metalogical properties than first-order logic. For example, the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem and compactness theorem of first-order logic become false when generalized to higher-order logics with full semantics.\n\nAutomated theorem proving and formal methods\n\nAutomated theorem proving refers to the development of computer programs that search and find derivations (formal proofs) of mathematical theorems. Finding derivations is a difficult task because the search space can be very large; an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but computationally infeasible for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated heuristic functions are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search.\n\nThe related area of automated proof verification uses computer programs to check that human-created proofs are correct.  Unlike complicated automated theorem provers, verification systems may be small enough that their correctness can be checked both by hand and through automated software verification. This validation of the proof verifier is needed to give confidence that any derivation labeled as \"correct\" is actually correct.\n\nSome proof verifiers, such as Metamath, insist on having a complete derivation as input.  Others, such as Mizar and Isabelle, take a well-formatted proof sketch (which may still be very long and detailed) and fill in the missing pieces by doing simple proof searches or applying known decision procedures: the resulting derivation is then verified by a small, core \"kernel\". Many such systems are primarily intended for interactive use by human mathematicians: these are known as proof assistants.  They may also use formal logics that are stronger than first-order logic, such as type theory. Because a full derivation of any nontrivial result in a first-order deductive system will be extremely long for a human to write,Avigad et al. (2007) discuss the process of formally verifying a proof of the prime number theorem. The formalized proof required approximately 30,000 lines of input to the Isabelle proof verifier. results are often formalized as a series of lemmas, for which derivations can be constructed separately.\n\nAutomated theorem provers are also used to implement formal verification in computer science.  In this setting, theorem provers are used to verify the correctness of programs and of hardware such as processors with respect to a formal specification. Because such analysis is time-consuming and thus expensive, it is usually reserved for projects in which a malfunction would have grave human or financial consequences.\n\nFor the problem of model checking, efficient algorithms are known to decide whether an input finite structure satisfies a first-order formula, in addition to computational complexity bounds: see Model_checking#First-order_logic.\n\nSee also\n\n ACL2 \u2014 A Computational Logic for Applicative Common Lisp.\n Equiconsistency\n Extension by definitions\n Herbrandization\n Higher-order logic\n List of logic symbols\n L\u00f6wenheim number\n Nonfirstorderizability\n Prenex normal form\n Relational algebra\n Relational model\n Second-order logic\n Skolem normal form\n Tarski's World\n Truth table\n Type (model theory)\n Prolog\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Andrews, Peter B.

{"title": "General topology", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_topology", "text": "thumb|420px|The Topologist's sine curve, a useful example in point-set topology. It is connected but not path-connected.\n\nIn mathematics, general topology is the branch of topology that deals with the basic set-theoretic definitions and constructions used in topology. It is the foundation of most other branches of topology, including differential topology, geometric topology, and algebraic topology. Another name for general topology is point-set topology.\n\nThe fundamental concepts in point-set topology are continuity, compactness, and connectedness: \n Continuous functions, intuitively, take nearby points to nearby points. \n Compact sets are those that can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size.\n Connected sets are sets that cannot be divided into two pieces that are far apart. \nThe words 'nearby', 'arbitrarily small', and 'far apart' can all be made precise by using the concept of open sets. If we change the definition of 'open set', we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice of definition for 'open set' is called a topology. A set with a topology is called a topological space.\n\nMetric spaces are an important class of topological spaces where a real, non-negative distance, also called a metric, can be defined on pairs of points in the set. Having a metric simplifies many proofs, and many of the most common topological spaces are metric spaces.\n\n History \nGeneral topology grew out of a number of areas, most importantly the following:\n\nthe detailed study of subsets of the real line (once known as the topology of point sets; this usage is now obsolete)\nthe introduction of the manifold concept\nthe study of metric spaces, especially normed linear spaces, in the early days of functional analysis.\n\nGeneral topology assumed its present form around 1940. It captures, one might say, almost everything in the intuition of continuity, in a technically adequate form that can be applied in any area of mathematics.\n\nA topology on a set\n\nLet X be a set and let \u03c4 be a family of subsets of X. Then \u03c4 is called a topology on X if:Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000.Adams, Colin Conrad, and Robert David Franzosa. Introduction to topology: pure and applied. Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008.\n\n Both the empty set and X are elements of \u03c4\n Any union of elements of \u03c4 is an element of \u03c4\n Any intersection of finitely many elements of \u03c4 is an element of \u03c4\n\nIf \u03c4 is a topology on X, then the pair (X, \u03c4) is called a topological space. The notation X\u03c4 may be used to denote a set X endowed with the particular topology \u03c4.\n\nThe members of \u03c4 are called open sets in X. A subset of X is said to be closed if its complement is in \u03c4 (i.e., its complement is open). A subset of X may be open, closed, both (clopen set), or neither. The empty set and X itself are always both closed and open.\n\nBasis for a topology\n\nA base (or basis) B for a topological space X with topology T is a collection of open sets in T such that every open set in T can be written as a union of elements of B.  We say that the base generates the topology T. Bases are useful because many properties of topologies can be reduced to statements about a base that generates that topology\u2014and because many topologies are most easily defined in terms of a base that generates them.\n\nSubspace and quotient\nEvery subset of a topological space can be given the subspace topology in which the open sets are the intersections of the open sets of the larger space with the subset.  For any indexed family of topological spaces, the product can be given the product topology, which is generated by the inverse images of open sets of the factors under the projection mappings. For example, in finite products, a basis for the product topology consists of all products of open sets. For infinite products, there is the additional requirement that in a basic open set, all but finitely many of its projections are the entire space.\n\nA quotient space is defined as follows: if X is a topological space and Y is a set, and if f : X\u2192 Y is a surjective function, then the quotient topology on Y is the collection of subsets of Y that have open inverse images under f. In other words, the quotient topology is the finest topology on Y for which f is continuous.  A common example of a quotient topology is when an equivalence relation is defined on the topological space X.  The map f is then the natural projection onto the set of equivalence classes.\n\nExamples of topological spaces\nA given set may have many different topologies.  If a set is given a different topology, it is viewed as a different topological space.  Any set can be given the discrete topology in which every subset is open.  The only convergent sequences or nets in this topology are those that are eventually constant.  Also, any set can be given the trivial topology (also called the indiscrete topology), in which only the empty set and the whole space are open.  Every sequence and net in this topology converges to every point of the space.  This example shows that in general topological spaces, limits of sequences need not be unique. However, often topological spaces must be Hausdorff spaces where limit points are unique.\n\nThere are many ways to define a topology on R, the set of real numbers.  The standard topology on R is generated by the open intervals.  The set of all open intervals forms a base or basis for the topology, meaning that every open set is a union of some collection of sets from the base. In particular, this means that a set is open if there exists an open interval of non zero radius about every point in the set. More generally, the Euclidean spaces Rn can be given a topology.  In the usual topology on Rn the basic open sets are the open balls.  Similarly, C, the set of complex numbers, and Cn have a standard topology in which the basic open sets are open balls.\n\nEvery metric space can be given a metric topology, in which the basic open sets are open balls defined by the metric.  This is the standard topology on any normed vector space. On a finite-dimensional vector space this topology is the same for all norms.\n\nMany sets of linear operators in functional analysis are endowed with topologies that are defined by specifying when a particular sequence of functions converges to the zero function.\n\nAny local field has a topology native to it, and this can be extended to vector spaces over that field.\n\nEvery manifold has a natural topology since it is locally Euclidean.  Similarly, every simplex and every simplicial complex inherits a natural topology from Rn.\n\nThe Zariski topology is defined algebraically on the spectrum of a ring or an algebraic variety.  On Rn or Cn, the closed sets of the Zariski topology are the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.\n\nA linear graph has a natural topology that generalises many of the geometric aspects of graphs with vertices and edges.\n\nThe Sierpi\u0144ski space is the simplest non-discrete topological space.  It has important relations to the theory of computation and semantics.\n\nThere exist numerous topologies on any given finite set. Such spaces are called finite topological spaces. Finite spaces are sometimes used to provide examples or counterexamples to conjectures about topological spaces in general.\n\nAny set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite.  This is the smallest T1 topology on any infinite set.\n\nAny set can be given the cocountable topology, in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable.  When the set is uncountable, this topology serves as a counterexample in many situations.\n\nThe real line can also be given the lower limit topology.  Here, the basic open sets are the half open intervals [a, b).  This topology on R is strictly finer than the Euclidean topology defined above; a sequence converges to a point in this topology if and only if it converges from above in the Euclidean topology.  This example shows that a set may have many distinct topologies defined on it.\n\nIf \u0393 is an ordinal number, then the set \u0393 = [0,\u00a0\u0393) may be endowed with the order topology generated by the intervals (a,\u00a0b), [0,\u00a0b) and (a,\u00a0\u0393) where a and b are elements of \u0393.\n\nContinuous functions\n\nContinuity is expressed in terms of neighborhoods:  is continuous at some point  if and only if for any neighborhood  of , there is a neighborhood  of  such that . Intuitively, continuity means no matter how \"small\"  becomes, there is always a  containing  that maps inside  and whose image under  contains . This is equivalent to the condition that the preimages of the open (closed) sets in  are open (closed) in . In metric spaces, this definition is equivalent to the \u03b5\u2013\u03b4-definition that is often used in analysis.\n\nAn extreme example: if a set  is given the discrete topology, all functions \n\nto any topological space  are continuous. On the other hand, if  is equipped with the indiscrete topology and the space  set is at least T0, then the only continuous functions are the constant functions. Conversely, any function whose range is indiscrete is continuous.\n\nAlternative definitions\nSeveral equivalent definitions for a topological structure exist and thus there are several equivalent ways to define a continuous function.\n\nNeighborhood definition\nDefinitions based on preimages are often difficult to use directly. The following criterion expresses continuity in terms of neighborhoods: f is continuous at some point x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0X if and only if for any neighborhood V of f(x), there is a neighborhood U of x such that f(U)\u00a0\u2286\u00a0V. Intuitively, continuity means no matter how \"small\" V becomes, there is always a U containing x that maps inside V.\n\nIf X and Y are metric spaces, it is equivalent to consider the neighborhood system of open balls centered at x and f(x) instead of all neighborhoods. This gives back the above \u03b4-\u03b5 definition of continuity in the context of metric spaces. However, in general topological spaces, there is no notion of nearness or distance.\n\nNote, however, that if the target space is Hausdorff, it is still true that f is continuous at a if and only if the limit of f as x approaches a is f(a).  At an isolated point, every function is continuous.\n\nSequences and nets \nIn several contexts, the topology of a space is conveniently  specified in terms of limit points.  In many instances, this is accomplished by specifying when a point is the limit of a sequence, but for some spaces that are too large in some sense, one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a directed set, known as nets.  A function is continuous only if it takes limits of sequences to limits of sequences.  In the former case, preservation of limits is also sufficient; in the latter, a function may preserve all limits of sequences yet still fail to be continuous, and preservation of nets is a necessary and sufficient condition.\n\nIn detail, a function f: X \u2192 Y is sequentially continuous if whenever a sequence (xn) in X converges to a limit x, the sequence (f(xn)) converges to f(x).  Thus sequentially continuous functions \"preserve sequential limits\".  Every continuous function is sequentially continuous.  If X is a first-countable space and countable choice holds, then the converse also holds: any function preserving sequential limits is continuous.  In particular, if X is a metric space, sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent.  For non first-countable spaces, sequential continuity might be strictly weaker than continuity. (The spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called sequential spaces.) This motivates the consideration of nets instead of sequences in general topological spaces.  Continuous functions preserve limits of nets, and in fact this property characterizes continuous functions.\n\nClosure operator definition\nInstead of specifying the open subsets of a topological space, the topology can also be determined by a closure operator (denoted cl), which assigns to any subset A \u2286 X its closure, or an interior operator (denoted int), which assigns to any subset A of X its interior. In these terms, a function \n\nbetween topological spaces is continuous in the sense above if and only if for all subsets A of X\n\nThat is to say, given any element x of X that is in the closure of any subset A, f(x) belongs to the closure of f(A). This is equivalent to the requirement that for all subsets A' of X'\n\nMoreover, \n\nis continuous if and only if \n\nfor any subset A of X.\n\nProperties\nIf f: X \u2192 Y and g: Y \u2192 Z are continuous, then so is the composition g \u2218 f: X \u2192 Z. If f: X \u2192 Y is continuous and\n X is compact, then f(X) is compact.\n X is connected, then f(X) is connected.\n X is path-connected, then f(X) is path-connected.\n X is Lindel\u00f6f, then f(X) is Lindel\u00f6f.\n X is separable, then f(X) is separable.\n\nThe possible topologies on a fixed set X are partially ordered: a topology \u03c41 is said to be coarser than another topology \u03c42 (notation: \u03c41 \u2286 \u03c42) if every open subset with respect to \u03c41 is also open with respect to \u03c42. Then, the identity map \nidX: (X, \u03c42) \u2192 (X, \u03c41)\nis continuous if and only if \u03c41 \u2286 \u03c42 (see also comparison of topologies). More generally, a continuous function\n\nstays continuous if the topology \u03c4Y is replaced by a coarser topology and/or \u03c4X is replaced by a finer topology.\n\nHomeomorphisms\nSymmetric to the concept of a continuous map is an open map, for which images of open sets are open. In fact, if an open map f has an inverse function, that inverse is continuous, and if a continuous map g has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a bijective function f between two topological spaces, the inverse function f\u22121 need not be continuous. A bijective continuous function with continuous inverse function is called a homeomorphism.\n\nIf a continuous bijection has as its domain a compact space and its codomain is Hausdorff, then it is a homeomorphism.\n\nDefining topologies via continuous functions\nGiven a function\n\nwhere X is a topological space and S is a set (without a specified topology), the final topology on S is defined by letting the open sets of S be those subsets A of S for which f\u22121(A) is open in X. If S has an existing topology, f is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is coarser than the final topology on S.  Thus the final topology can be characterized as the finest topology on S that makes f continuous.  If f is surjective, this topology is canonically identified with the quotient topology under the equivalence relation defined by f.\n\nDually, for a function f from a set S to a topological space, the initial topology on S has as open subsets A of S those subsets for which f(A) is open in X.  If S has an existing topology, f is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is finer than the initial topology on S.  Thus the initial topology can be characterized as the coarsest topology on S that makes f continuous.  If f is injective, this topology is canonically identified with the subspace topology of S, viewed as a subset of X.\n\nA topology on a set S is uniquely determined by the class of all continuous functions  into all topological spaces X. Dually, a similar idea can be applied to maps \n\nCompact sets\n\nFormally, a topological space X is called compact if each of its open covers has a finite subcover. Otherwise it is called non-compact.  Explicitly, this means that for every arbitrary collection\n\nof open subsets of  such that\n\nthere is a finite subset  of  such that\n\nSome branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, typically influenced by the French school of Bourbaki, use the term quasi-compact for the general notion, and reserve the term compact for topological spaces that are both Hausdorff and quasi-compact.  A compact set is sometimes referred to as a compactum, plural compacta.\n\nEvery closed interval in R of finite length is compact. More is true: In Rn, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. (See Heine\u2013Borel theorem).\n\nEvery continuous image of a compact space is compact.\n\nA compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed.\n\nEvery continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is necessarily a homeomorphism.\n\nEvery sequence of points in a compact metric space has a convergent subsequence.\n\nEvery compact finite-dimensional manifold can be embedded in some Euclidean space Rn.\n\nConnected sets\n\nA topological space X is said to be disconnected if it is the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. Otherwise, X is said to be connected.  A subset of a topological space is said to be connected if it is connected under its subspace topology. Some authors exclude the empty set (with its unique topology) as a connected space, but this article does not follow that practice.\n\nFor a topological space X the following conditions are equivalent:\n\nX is connected.\nX cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty closed sets.\nThe only subsets of X that are both open and closed (clopen sets) are X and the empty set.\nThe only subsets of X with empty boundary are X and the empty set.\nX cannot be written as the union of two nonempty separated sets.\nThe only continuous functions from X to {0,1}, the two-point space endowed with the discrete topology, are constant.\n\nEvery interval in R is connected.\n\nThe continuous image of a connected space is connected.\n\nConnected components\nThe maximal connected subsets (ordered by inclusion) of a nonempty topological space are called the connected components of the space.\nThe components of any topological space X form a partition of\u00a0X: they are disjoint, nonempty, and their union is the whole space.\nEvery component is a closed subset of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the rational numbers are the one-point sets, which are not open.\n\nLet  be the connected component of x in a topological space X, and  be the intersection of all open-closed sets containing x (called quasi-component of x.) Then  where the equality holds if X is compact Hausdorff or locally connected.\n\nDisconnected spaces\nA space in which all components are one-point sets is called totally disconnected. Related to this property, a space X is called totally separated if, for any two distinct elements x and y of X, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods U of x and V of y such that X is the union of U and V. Clearly any totally separated space is totally disconnected, but the converse does not hold. For example, take two copies of the rational numbers Q, and identify them at every point except zero. The resulting space, with the quotient topology, is totally disconnected. However, by considering the two copies of zero, one sees that the space is not totally separated.  In fact, it is not even Hausdorff, and the condition of being totally separated is strictly stronger than the condition of being Hausdorff.\n\nPath-connected sets\nthumb|This subspace of R\u00b2 is path-connected, because a path can be drawn between any two points in the space.\n\nA path from a point x to a point y  in a topological space X is  a continuous function f from the unit interval [0,1] to X with f(0) = x and f(1) = y. A path-component of X is an equivalence class of X under the equivalence relation, which makes x  equivalent to y if there is a path from x to y. The space X is said to be path-connected (or pathwise connected or 0-connected) if there is at most one path-component, i.e. if there is a path joining any two points in X. Again, many authors exclude the empty space.\n\nEvery path-connected space is connected. The converse is not always true: examples of connected spaces that are not path-connected include the extended long line L* and the topologist's sine curve.\n\nHowever, subsets of the real line R are connected if and only if they are path-connected; these subsets are the intervals of R.\nAlso, open subsets of Rn or Cn are connected if and only if they are path-connected.\nAdditionally, connectedness and path-connectedness are the same for finite topological spaces.\n\nProducts of spaces\n\nGiven X such that\n\nis the Cartesian product of the topological spaces Xi, indexed by , and the canonical projections pi : X \u2192 Xi, the product topology on X is defined as the coarsest topology (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections pi are continuous.  The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff topology.\n\nThe open sets in the product topology are unions (finite or infinite) of sets of the form , where each Ui is open in Xi and Ui\u00a0\u2260\u00a0Xi only finitely many times. In particular, for a finite product (in particular, for the product of two topological spaces), the products of base elements of the Xi gives a basis for the product .\n\nThe product topology on X is the topology generated by sets of the form pi\u22121(U), where  i is in I   and U is an open subset of Xi. In other words, the sets {pi\u22121(U)} form a subbase for the topology on X. A subset of X is open if and only if it is a (possibly infinite) union of intersections of finitely many sets of the form pi\u22121(U). The pi\u22121(U) are sometimes called open cylinders, and their intersections are cylinder sets.\n\nIn general, the product of the topologies of each Xi forms a basis for what is called the box topology on X. In general, the box topology is finer than the product topology, but for finite products they coincide.\n\nRelated to compactness is Tychonoff's theorem: the (arbitrary) product of compact spaces is compact.\n\nSeparation axioms\n\nMany of these names have alternative meanings in some of mathematical literature, as explained on History of the separation axioms; for example, the meanings of \"normal\" and \"T4\" are sometimes interchanged, similarly \"regular\" and \"T3\", etc. Many of the concepts also have several names; however, the one listed first is always least likely to be ambiguous.\n\nMost of these axioms have alternative definitions with the same meaning; the definitions given here fall into a consistent pattern that relates the various notions of separation defined in the previous section. Other possible definitions can be found in the individual articles.\n\nIn all of the following definitions, X is again a topological space.\n\n X is T0, or Kolmogorov, if any two distinct points in X are topologically distinguishable. (It is a common theme among the separation axioms to have one version of an axiom that requires T0 and one version that doesn't.)\n X is T1, or accessible or Fr\u00e9chet, if any two distinct points in X are separated. Thus, X is T1 if and only if it is both T0 and R0. (Though you may say such things as T1 space, Fr\u00e9chet topology, and Suppose that the topological space X is Fr\u00e9chet, avoid saying Fr\u00e9chet space in this context, since there is another entirely different notion of Fr\u00e9chet space in functional analysis.)\n X is Hausdorff, or T2 or separated, if any two distinct points in X are separated by neighbourhoods. Thus, X is Hausdorff if and only if it is both T0 and R1. A Hausdorff space must also be T1.\n X is T2\u00bd, or Urysohn, if any two distinct points in X are separated by closed neighbourhoods. A T2\u00bd space must also be Hausdorff.\n X is regular, or T3, if it is T0 and if given any point x and closed set F in X such that x does not belong to F, they are separated by neighbourhoods. (In fact, in a regular space, any such x and F is also separated by closed neighbourhoods.)\n X is Tychonoff, or T3\u00bd, completely T3, or completely regular, if it is T0 and if f, given any point x and closed set F in X such that x does not belong to F, they are separated by a continuous function.\n X is normal, or T4, if it is Hausdorff and if any two disjoint closed subsets of X are separated by neighbourhoods. (In fact, a space is normal if and only if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by a continuous function; this is Urysohn's lemma.)\n X is completely normal, or T5 or completely T4, if it is T1 and if any two separated sets are separated by neighbourhoods. A completely normal space must also be normal.\n X is perfectly normal, or T6 or perfectly T4, if it is T1 and if any two disjoint closed sets are precisely separated by a continuous function. A perfectly normal Hausdorff space must also be completely normal Hausdorff.\n\nThe Tietze extension theorem: In a normal space, every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subspace can be extended to a continuous map defined on the whole space.\n\nCountability axioms\n\nAn axiom of countability is a property of certain mathematical objects (usually in a category) that requires the existence of a countable set with certain properties, while without it such sets might not exist.\n\nImportant countability axioms for topological spaces:\nsequential space: a set is open if every sequence convergent to a point in the set is eventually in the set\nfirst-countable space: every point has a countable neighbourhood basis (local  base)\nsecond-countable space: the topology has a countable base\nseparable space: there exists a countable dense subspace\nLindel\u00f6f space: every open cover has a countable subcover\n\u03c3-compact space: there exists a countable cover by compact spaces\n\nRelations:\nEvery first countable space is sequential.\nEvery second-countable space is first-countable, separable, and Lindel\u00f6f.\nEvery \u03c3-compact space is Lindel\u00f6f.\nA metric space is first-countable.\nFor metric spaces second-countability, separability, and the Lindel\u00f6f property are all equivalent.\n\nMetric spaces\n\nA metric spaceMaurice Fr\u00e9chet introduced metric spaces in his work Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel, Rendic.

Pettis, American Mathematical Soc., 1958, page 50-5  The ideas of pointless topology are closely related to mereotopologies, in which regions (sets) are treated as foundational without explicit reference to underlying point sets.\n\nDimension theory\n\nDimension theory is a branch of general topology dealing with dimensional invariants of topological spaces.\n\nTopological algebras\n\nA topological algebra A over a topological field K is a topological vector space together with a continuous multiplication\n\nthat makes it an algebra over K. A unital associative topological algebra is a topological ring.\n\nThe term was coined by David van Dantzig; it appears in the title of his doctoral dissertation (1931).\n\nMetrizability theory\n\nIn topology and related areas of mathematics, a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space.

Metrization theorems are theorems that give sufficient conditions for a topological space to be metrizable.\n\nSet-theoretic topology\n\nSet-theoretic topology is a subject that combines set theory and general topology. It focuses on topological questions that are independent of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZFC).

{"title": "Gentzen's consistency proof", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentzen%27s_consistency_proof", "text": "Gentzen's consistency proof is a result of proof theory in mathematical logic, published by Gerhard Gentzen in 1936. It shows that the Peano axioms of first-order arithmetic do not contain a contradiction (i.e. are \"consistent\"), as long as a certain other system used in the proof does not contain any contradictions either. This other system, today called \"primitive recursive arithmetic with the additional principle of quantifier-free transfinite induction up to the ordinal \u03b50\", is neither weaker nor stronger than the system of Peano axioms.  Gentzen argued that it avoids the questionable modes of inference contained in Peano arithmetic and that its consistency is therefore less controversial.\n\nGentzen's theorem\nGentzen's theorem is concerned with first-order arithmetic: the theory of the natural numbers, including their addition and multiplication, axiomatized by the first-order Peano axioms. This is a \"first-order\" theory: the quantifiers extend over natural numbers, but not over sets or functions of natural numbers. The theory is strong enough to describe recursively defined integer functions such as exponentiation, factorials or the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nGentzen showed that the consistency of the first-order Peano axioms is provable, over the base theory of primitive recursive arithmetic with the additional principle of quantifier-free transfinite induction up to the ordinal \u03b50.  Primitive recursive arithmetic is a much simplified form of arithmetic that is rather uncontroversial.  The additional principle means, informally, that there is a well-ordering on the set of finite rooted trees.  Formally, \u03b50 is the first ordinal  such that , i.e. the limit of the sequence:\n\nTo express ordinals in the language of arithmetic, an ordinal notation is needed, i.e. a way to assign natural numbers to ordinals less than \u03b50. This can be done in various ways, one example provided by Cantor's normal form theorem. We require for any quantifier-free formula A(x): if there is an ordinal a< \u03b50 for which A(a) is false, then there is a least such ordinal.\n\nGentzen defines a notion of \"reduction procedure\" for proofs in Peano arithmetic. For a given proof, such a procedure produces a tree of proofs, with the given one serving as the root of the tree, and the other proofs being, in a sense, \"simpler\" than the given one. This increasing simplicity is formalized by attaching an ordinal < \u03b50 to every proof, and showing that, as one moves down the tree, these ordinals get smaller with every step.  He then shows that if there were a proof of a contradiction, the reduction procedure would result in an infinite descending sequence of ordinals smaller than \u03b50 produced by a primitive recursive operation on proofs corresponding to a quantifier-free formula.See  for a full presentation of Gentzen's proof and various comments on the historic and philosophical significance of the result.\n\nIt is possible to interpret Gentzen's proof in game-theoretic terms .\n\nRelation to Hilbert's program and G\u00f6del's theorem\nGentzen's proof highlights one commonly missed aspect of G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem. It is sometimes claimed that the consistency of a theory can only be proved in a stronger theory. Gentzen's theory obtained by adding quantifier-free transfinite induction to primitive recursive arithmetic proves the consistency of first-order Peano arithmetic (PA) but does not contain PA. For example, it does not prove ordinary mathematical induction for all formulae, whereas PA does (since all instance of induction are axioms of PA). Gentzen's theory is not contained in PA, either, however, since it can prove a number-theoretical fact\u2014the consistency of PA\u2014that PA cannot. Therefore, the two theories are, in one sense, incomparable.\n\nThat said, there are other, more powerful ways to compare the strength of theories, the most important of which is defined in terms of the notion of interpretability. It can be shown that, if one theory T is interpretable in another B, then T is consistent if B is. (Indeed, this is a large point of the notion of interpretability.) And, assuming that T is not extremely weak, T itself will be able to prove this very conditional: If B is consistent, then so is T. Hence, T cannot prove that B is consistent, by the second incompleteness theorem, whereas B may well be able to prove that T is consistent. This is what motivates the idea of using interpretability to compare theories, i.e., the thought that, if B interprets T, then B is at least as strong (in the sense of 'consistency strength') as T is.\n\nA strong form of the second incompleteness theorem, proved by Pavel Pudl\u00e1k, who was building on earlier work by Solomon Feferman, states that no consistent theory T that contains Robinson arithmetic, Q, can interpret Q plus Con(T), the statement that T is consistent. By contrast, Q+Con(T) does interpret T, by a strong form of the arithmetized completeness theorem. So Q+Con(T) is always stronger (in one good sense) than T is. But Gentzen's theory trivially interprets Q+Con(PA), since it contains Q and proves Con(PA), and so Gentzen's theory interprets PA. But, by Pudl\u00e1k's result, PA cannot interpret Gentzen's theory, since Gentzen's theory (as just said) interprets Q+Con(PA), and interpretability is transitive. That is: If PA did interpret Gentzen's theory, then it would also interpret Q+Con(PA) and so would be inconsistent, by Pudl\u00e1k's result. So, in the sense of consistency strength, as characterized by interpretability, Gentzen's theory is stronger than Peano arithmetic.\n\nHermann Weyl made the following comment in 1946 regarding the significance of Gentzen's consistency result following the devastating impact of G\u00f6del's 1931 incompleteness result on Hilbert's plan to prove the consistency of mathematics..\n\n It is likely that all mathematicians ultimately would have accepted Hilbert's approach had he been able to carry it out successfully. The first steps were inspiring and promising. But then G\u00f6del dealt it a terrific blow (1931), from which it has not yet recovered. G\u00f6del enumerated the symbols, formulas, and sequences of formulas in Hilbert's formalism in a certain way, and thus transformed the assertion of consistency into an arithmetic proposition. He could show that this proposition can neither be proved nor disproved within the formalism. This can mean only two things: either the reasoning by which a proof of consistency is given must contain some argument that has no formal counterpart within the system, i.e., we have not succeeded in completely formalizing the procedure of mathematical induction; or hope for a strictly \"finitistic\" proof of consistency must be given up altogether. When G. Gentzen finally succeeded in proving the consistency of arithmetic he trespassed those limits indeed by claiming as evident a type of reasoning that penetrates into Cantor's \"second class of ordinal numbers.\"\n\n made the following comment in 1952 on the significance of Gentzen's result, particularly in the context of the formalist program which was initiated by Hilbert.\n\n The original proposals of the formalists to make classical mathematics secure by a consistency proof did not contemplate that such a method as transfinite induction up to \u03b50 would have to be used. To what extent the Gentzen proof can be accepted as securing classical number theory in the sense of that problem formulation is in the present state of affairs a matter for individual judgement, depending on how ready one is to accept induction up to \u03b50 as a finitary method.\n\n Other consistency proofs of arithmetic \nGentzen's first version of his consistency proof was not published during his lifetime because Paul Bernays had objected to a method implicitly used in the proof. The modified proof, described above, was published in 1936 in the Annals. Gentzen went on to publish two more consistency proofs, one in 1938 and one in 1943. All of these are contained in .\n\nIn 1940 Wilhelm Ackermann published another consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, also using the ordinal \u03b50.\n\n Work initiated by Gentzen's proof \nGentzen's proof is the first example of what is called proof-theoretical ordinal analysis. In ordinal analysis one gauges the strength of theories by measuring how large the (constructive) ordinals are that can be proven to be well-ordered, or equivalently for how large a (constructive) ordinal can transfinite induction be proven. A constructive ordinal is the order type of a recursive well-ordering of natural numbers.\n\nLaurence Kirby and Jeff Paris proved in 1982 that Goodstein's theorem cannot be proven in Peano arithmetic. Their proof was based on Gentzen's theorem.\n\n Notes \n\nReferences\n \u2013 Translated as \"The consistency of arithmetic\", in .\n \u2013 Translated as \"New version of the consistency proof for elementary number theory\", in .\n - an English translation of papers.\n\nCategory:Metatheorems\nCategory:Proof theory"}
{"title": "Giuseppe Peano", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano", "text": "Giuseppe Peano (;\"Peano\". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 27 August 1858 \u2013 20 April 1932) was an Italian mathematician and glottologist. The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory, to which he contributed much notation. The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor. As part of this effort, he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of mathematical induction. He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the University of Turin.\nHe also wrote an international auxiliary language, Latino sine flexione (\"Latin without inflections\"), which is a simplified version of Classical Latin. Most of his books and papers are in Latin sine flexione, others are in Italian.\n\nBiography\nthumb|Aritmetica generale e algebra elementare, 1902\nPeano was born and raised on a farm at Spinetta, a hamlet now belonging to Cuneo, Piedmont, Italy. He attended the Liceo classico Cavour in Turin, and enrolled at the University of Turin in 1876, graduating in 1880 with high honors, after which the University employed him to assist first Enrico D'Ovidio, and then Angelo Genocchi, the Chair of calculus. Due to Genocchi's poor health, Peano took over the teaching of calculus course within two years. His first major work, a textbook on calculus, was published in 1884 and was credited to Genocchi. A few years later, Peano published his first book dealing with mathematical logic. Here the modern symbols for the union and intersection of sets appeared for the first time.\n\nthumb|right|Giuseppe Peano and his wife Carola Crosio in 1887\nIn 1887, Peano married Carola Crosio, the daughter of the Turin-based painter Luigi Crosio, known for painting the Refugium Peccatorum Madonna.The man who painted the MTA. Luigi Crosio 1835\u20131916 . Schoenstatt webpage In 1886, he began teaching concurrently at the Royal Military Academy, and was promoted to Professor First Class in 1889. In that year he published the Peano axioms, a formal foundation for the collection of natural numbers. The next year, the University of Turin also granted him his full professorship. Peano's famous space-filling curve appeared in 1890 as a counterexample. He used it to show that a continuous curve cannot always be enclosed in an arbitrarily small region. This was an early example of what came to be known as a fractal.\n\nIn 1890 Peano founded the journal Rivista di Matematica, which published its first issue in January 1891. In 1891 Peano started the Formulario Project. It was to be an \"Encyclopedia of Mathematics\", containing all known formulae and theorems of mathematical science using a standard notation invented by Peano. In 1897, the first International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Z\u00fcrich. Peano was a key participant, presenting a paper on mathematical logic. He also started to become increasingly occupied with Formulario to the detriment of his other work.\n\nIn 1898 he presented a note to the Academy about binary numeration and its ability to be used to represent the sounds of languages. He also became so frustrated with publishing delays (due to his demand that formulae be printed on one line) that he purchased a printing press.\n\nParis was the venue for the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900. The conference was preceded by the First International Conference of Philosophy where Peano was a member of the patronage committee. He presented a paper which posed the question of correctly formed definitions in mathematics, i.e. \"how do you define a definition?\". This became one of Peano's main philosophical interests for the rest of his life. At the conference Peano met Bertrand Russell and gave him a copy of Formulario. Russell was so struck by Peano's innovative logical symbols that he left the conference and returned home to study Peano's text.\n\nPeano's students Mario Pieri and Alessandro Padoa had papers presented at the philosophy congress also. For the mathematical congress, Peano did not speak, but Padoa's memorable presentation has been frequently recalled. A resolution calling for the formation of an \"international auxiliary language\" to facilitate the spread of mathematical (and commercial) ideas, was proposed; Peano fully supported it.\n\nBy 1901, Peano was at the peak of his mathematical career. He had made advances in the areas of analysis, foundations and logic, made many contributions to the teaching of calculus and also contributed to the fields of differential equations and vector analysis. Peano played a key role in the axiomatization of mathematics and was a leading pioneer in the development of mathematical logic. Peano had by this stage become heavily involved with the Formulario project and his teaching began to suffer. In fact, he became so determined to teach his new mathematical symbols that the calculus in his course was neglected. As a result, he was dismissed from the Royal Military Academy but retained his post at Turin University.\n\nIn 1903 Peano announced his work on an international auxiliary language called Latino sine flexione (\"Latin without inflexion,\" later called Interlingua, and the precursor of the Interlingua of the IALA). This was an important project for him (along with finding contributors for 'Formulario'). The idea was to use Latin vocabulary, since this was widely known, but simplify the grammar as much as possible and remove all irregular and anomalous forms to make it easier to learn. On 3 January 1908, he read a paper to the  Academia delle Scienze di Torino in which he started speaking in Latin and, as he described each simplification, introduced it into his speech so that by the end he was talking in his new language.Bodmer, Frederick (1944), The Loom of Language, London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd, p.468\n\nThe year 1908 was important for Peano. The fifth and final edition of the Formulario project, titled Formulario mathematico, was published. It contained 4200 formulae and theorems, all completely stated and most of them proved. The book received little attention since much of the content was dated by this time. However, it remains a significant contribution to mathematical literature. The comments and examples were written in Latino sine flexione.\n\nAlso in 1908, Peano took over the chair of higher analysis at Turin (this appointment was to last for only two years). He was elected the director of Academia pro Interlingua. Having previously created Idiom Neutral, the Academy effectively chose to abandon it in favor of Peano's Latino sine flexione.\n\nAfter his mother died in 1910, Peano divided his time between teaching, working on texts aimed for secondary schooling including a dictionary of mathematics, and developing and promoting his and other auxiliary languages, becoming a revered member of the international auxiliary language movement. He used his membership of the Accademia dei Lincei to present papers written by friends and colleagues who were not members (the Accademia recorded and published all presented papers given in sessions).\n\nDuring the years 1913\u20131918, Peano published several papers that dealt with the remainder term for various numerical quadrature formulas, and introduced the Peano kernel.\n\nIn 1925 Peano switched Chairs unofficially from Infinitesimal Calculus to Complementary Mathematics, a field which better suited his current style of mathematics. This move became official in 1931.

{"title": "Goodstein's theorem", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodstein%27s_theorem", "text": "In mathematical logic, Goodstein's theorem is a statement about the natural numbers, proved by Reuben Goodstein in 1944, which states that every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0. Kirby and Paris showed that it is unprovable in Peano arithmetic (but it can be proven in stronger systems, such as second-order arithmetic). This was the third example of a true statement that is unprovable in Peano arithmetic, after G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem and Gerhard Gentzen's 1943 direct proof of the unprovability of \u03b50-induction in Peano arithmetic. The Paris\u2013Harrington theorem was a later example.\n\nLaurence Kirby and Jeff Paris introduced a graph-theoretic hydra game with behavior similar to that of Goodstein sequences: the \"Hydra\" is a rooted tree, and a move consists of cutting off one of its \"heads\" (a branch of the tree), to which the hydra responds by growing a finite number of new heads according to certain rules.  Kirby and Paris proved that the Hydra will eventually be killed, regardless of the strategy that Hercules uses to chop off its heads, though this may take a very long time. Just like for Goodstein sequences, Kirby and Paris showed that it cannot be proven in Peano arithmetic alone.\n\n Hereditary base-n notation \nGoodstein sequences are defined in terms of a concept called \"hereditary base-n notation\". This notation is very similar to usual base-n positional notation, but the usual notation does not suffice for the purposes of Goodstein's theorem.\n\nIn ordinary base-n notation, where n is a natural number greater than 1, an arbitrary natural number m is written as a sum of multiples of powers of n:\n\nwhere each coefficient ai satisfies , and . For example, in base 2,\n\nThus the base-2 representation of 35 is 100011, which means .  Similarly, 100 represented in base 3 is 10201:\n\nNote that the exponents themselves are not written in base-n notation. For example, the expressions above include 25 and 34, and 5>2, 4>3.\n\nTo convert a base-n representation to hereditary base-n notation, first rewrite all of the exponents in base-n notation. Then rewrite any exponents inside the exponents, and continue in this way until every number appearing in the expression has been converted to base-n notation.\n\nFor example, while 35 in ordinary base-2 notation is , it is written in hereditary base-2 notation as\n\nusing the fact that  Similarly, 100 in hereditary base-3 notation is\n\n Goodstein sequences \n\nThe Goodstein sequence  G(m) of a number m is a sequence of natural numbers. The first element in the sequence G(m) is m itself. To get the second, G(m)(2), write m in hereditary base-2 notation, change all the 2s to 3s, and then subtract 1 from the result. In general, the  term  of the Goodstein sequence of m is as follows:\n Take the hereditary base- representation of G(m)(n).\n Replace each occurrence of the base- with .\n Subtract one. (Note that the next term depends both on the previous term and on the index n.)\n Continue until the result is zero, at which point the sequence terminates.\n\nEarly Goodstein sequences terminate quickly. For example, G(3) terminates at the 6th step:\n\n Base  Hereditary notation  Value  Notes    2              3  Write 3 in base-2 notation    3    3  Switch the 2 to a 3, then subtract 1    4          3  Switch the 3 to a 4, then subtract 1. Now there are no more 4s left    5            2  No 4s left to switch to 5s. Just subtract 1    6            1  No 5s left to switch to 6s. Just subtract 1    7            0  No 6s left to switch to 7s. Just subtract 1\n\nLater Goodstein sequences increase for a very large number of steps. For example, G(4)  starts as follows:\n\n Hereditary notation  Value                                                  4                26                          41                              60    83                                  109                                                                                   253            299                                                          1151\n\nElements of G(4) continue to increase for a while, but at base ,\nthey reach the maximum of , stay there for the next  steps, and then begin their first and final descent.\n\nThe value 0 is reached at base . (Curiously, this is a Woodall number: . This is also the case with all other final bases for starting values greater than 4.)\n\nHowever, even G(4) doesn't give a good idea of just how quickly the elements of a Goodstein sequence can increase.\nG(19) increases much more rapidly and starts as follows:\n\n Hereditary notation  Value     19                                                  \n \n   \n \n \n       \n\nIn spite of this rapid growth, Goodstein's theorem states that every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0, no matter what the starting value is.\n\n Proof of Goodstein's theorem \n\nGoodstein's theorem can be proved (using techniques outside Peano arithmetic, see below) as follows: Given a Goodstein sequence G(m), we construct a parallel sequence P(m) of ordinal numbers which is strictly decreasing and terminates. Then G(m) must terminate too, and it can terminate only when it goes to 0. A common misunderstanding of this proof is to believe that G(m) goes to 0 because it is dominated by P(m). Actually, the fact that P(m) dominates G(m) plays no role at all. The important point is: G(m)(k) exists if and only if P(m)(k) exists (parallelism). Then if P(m) terminates, so does G(m). And G(m) can terminate only when it comes to 0.\n\nWe define a function  which computes the hereditary base  representation of  and then replaces each occurrence of the base  with the first infinite ordinal number \u03c9. For example, .\n\nEach term P(m)(n) of the sequence P(m) is then defined as f(G(m)(n),n+1). For example,  and . Addition, multiplication and exponentiation of ordinal numbers are well defined.\n\nWe claim that :\n\nLet  be  G(m)(n) after applying the first, \nbase-changing operation in generating the next element of the Goodstein sequence, \nbut before the second minus 1 operation in this generation. \nObserve that .\n\nThen clearly, . Now we apply the minus 1 operation, and , as .\nFor example,  and , so  and , which is strictly smaller. Note that in order to calculate f(G(m)(n),n+1), we first need to write G(m)(n) in hereditary base  notation, as for instance the expression  either makes no sense or is equal to .\n\nThus the sequence P(m) is strictly decreasing. As the standard order < on ordinals is well-founded, an infinite strictly decreasing sequence cannot exist, or equivalently, every strictly decreasing sequence of ordinals terminates (and cannot be infinite). But P(m)(n) is calculated directly from G(m)(n). Hence the sequence G(m) must terminate as well, meaning that it must reach 0.\n\nWhile this proof of Goodstein's theorem is fairly easy, the Kirby\u2013Paris theorem, which shows that Goodstein's theorem is not a theorem of Peano arithmetic, is technical and considerably more difficult. It makes use of countable nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic.\n\n Extended Goodstein's theorem \n\nSuppose the definition Goodstein sequence is changed so that instead of\nreplacing each occurrence of the base b with \nit replaces it with . Would the sequence still terminate?\nMore generally, let b1, b2, b3, \u2026 be any sequences of integers.\nThen let the \nterm  of the extended Goodstein sequence of m be as\nfollows: take the hereditary base bn representation of\nG(m)(n), and replace each occurrence of the base bn\nwith  and then subtract one.\nThe claim is that this sequence still terminates.\nThe extended proof defines  as\nfollows: take the hereditary base bn representation of\nG(m)(n), and replace each occurrence of the base\nbn with the first infinite ordinal number \u03c9.\nThe base-changing operation of the Goodstein sequence when going\nfrom G(m)(n) to  still does not change the value of f.\nFor example, if  and if ,\nthen\n, hence the ordinal  is strictly greater than the ordinal \n\n Sequence length as a function of the starting value \n\nThe Goodstein function, , is defined such that  is the length of the Goodstein sequence that starts with n.  (This is a total function since every Goodstein sequence terminates.)  The extreme growth-rate of  can be calibrated by relating it to various standard ordinal-indexed hierarchies of functions, such as the functions  in the Hardy hierarchy, and the functions  in the fast-growing hierarchy of L\u00f6b and Wainer:\n\n Kirby and Paris (1982) proved that\n has approximately the same growth-rate as  (which is the same as that of ); more precisely,  dominates  for every , and  dominates \n(For any two functions ,  is said to dominate  if  for all sufficiently large .)\n\n Cichon (1983) showed that\n\nwhere  is the result of putting n in hereditary base-2 notation and then replacing all 2s with \u03c9 (as was done in the proof of Goodstein's theorem).\n\n Caicedo (2007) showed that if  with  then\n.\n\nSome examples:\n\n n   1     2 2     4 3     6 4     3\u00b72402653211 \u2212 2 \u2248 6.895080803\u00d710<sup>121210694<sup> 5     > A(4,4)> 6      > A(6,6) 7      > A(8,8) 8      > A3(3,3) = A(A(61, 61), A(61, 61))  12      >  f\u03c9+1(64) > Graham's number  19     \n(For Ackermann function and Graham's number bounds see fast-growing hierarchy#Functions in fast-growing hierarchies.)\n\n Application to computable functions \n\nGoodstein's theorem can be used to construct a total computable function that Peano arithmetic cannot prove to be total.  The Goodstein sequence of a number can be effectively enumerated by a Turing machine; thus the function which maps n to the number of steps required for the Goodstein sequence of n to terminate is computable by a particular Turing machine.  This machine merely enumerates the Goodstein sequence of n and, when the sequence reaches 0, returns the length of the sequence.  Because every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates, this function is total.   But because Peano arithmetic does not prove that every Goodstein sequence terminates, Peano arithmetic does not prove that this Turing machine computes a total function.\n\nSee also\n Non-standard model of arithmetic\n Fast-growing hierarchy\n Paris\u2013Harrington theorem\n Kanamori\u2013McAloon theorem\n Kruskal's tree theorem\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n .\n .\n .\n\nExternal links\n \nSome elements of a proof that Goodstein's theorem is not a theorem of PA, from an undergraduate thesis by Justin T Miller\n  A Classification of non standard models of Peano Arithmetic by Goodstein's theorem - Thesis by Dan Kaplan, Franklan and Marshall College Library\nDefinitions of Goodstein sequences in the programming languages Ruby and Haskell, as well as a large-scale plot\n The Hydra game implemented as a Java applet\n Javascript implementation of a variant of the Hydra game\n Goodstein Sequences: The Power of a Detour via Infinity - good exposition with illustrations of Goodstein Sequences and the hydra game.\n Goodstein Calculator\n\nCategory:Independence results\nCategory:Articles containing proofs\nCategory:Set theory\nCategory:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics\nCategory:Large numbers"}

{"title": "G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems", "text": "G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal axiomatic system capable of modelling basic arithmetic.  These results, published by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics. The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible.\n\nThe first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the natural numbers.  For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.\n\nEmploying a diagonal argument, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems were the first of several closely related theorems on the limitations of formal systems. They were followed by Tarski's undefinability theorem on the formal undefinability of truth, Church's proof that Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable, and Turing's theorem that there is no algorithm to solve the halting problem.\n\n Formal systems: completeness, consistency, and effective axiomatization \n\nThe incompleteness theorems apply to formal systems that are of sufficient complexity to express the basic arithmetic of the natural numbers and which are consistent, and  effectively axiomatized, these concepts being detailed below. Particularly in the context of first-order logic, formal systems are also called formal theories. In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms.  One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability within these systems, rather than about \"provability\" in an informal sense.\n\nThere are several properties that a formal system may have, including completeness, consistency, and the existence of an effective axiomatization. The incompleteness theorems show that systems which contain a sufficient amount of arithmetic cannot possess all three of these properties.\n\n Effective axiomatization \n\nA formal system is said to be effectively axiomatized (also called effectively generated) if its set of theorems is a recursively enumerable set (Franz\u00e9n 2005, p.\u00a0112).\n\nThis means that there is a computer program that, in principle, could enumerate all the theorems of the system without listing any statements that are not theorems. Examples of effectively generated theories include Peano arithmetic and Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZFC).\n\nThe theory known as true arithmetic consists of all true statements about the standard integers in the language of Peano arithmetic. This theory is consistent, and complete, and contains a sufficient amount of arithmetic. However it does not have a recursively enumerable set of axioms, and thus does not satisfy the hypotheses of the incompleteness theorems.\n\n Completeness \n\nA set of axioms is (syntactically, or negation-) complete if, for any statement in the axioms' language, that statement or its negation is provable from the axioms (Smith 2007, p.\u00a0 24). This is the notion relevant for G\u00f6del's first Incompleteness theorem. It  is not to be confused with semantic completeness, which means that the set of axioms proves all the semantic tautologies of the given language. In his completeness theorem, G\u00f6del proved that first order logic is semantically complete. But it is not syntactically complete, since there are sentences expressible in the language of first order logic that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms of logic alone.\n\nIn a mere system of logic it would be absurd to expect syntactic completeness. But in a system of mathematics, thinkers such as Hilbert had believed that it is just a matter of time to find such an axiomatization that would allow one to either prove or disprove (by proving its negation) each and every mathematical formula.\n\nA formal system might be syntactically incomplete by design, as logics generally are. Or it may be incomplete simply because not all the necessary axioms have been discovered or included. For example, Euclidean geometry without the parallel postulate is incomplete, because some statements in the language (such as the parallel postulate itself) can not be proved from the remaining axioms. Similarly, the theory of dense linear orders is not complete, but becomes complete with an extra axiom stating that there are no endpoints in the order. The continuum hypothesis is a statement in the language of ZFC that is not provable within ZFC, so ZFC is not complete. In this case, there is no obvious candidate for a new axiom that resolves the issue.\n\nThe theory of first order Peano arithmetic seems to be consistent. Assuming this is indeed the case, note that it has an infinite but recursively enumerable set of axioms, and can encode enough arithmetic for the hypotheses of the incompleteness theorem. Thus by the first incompleteness theorem, Peano Arithmetic is not complete. The theorem gives an explicit example of a statement of arithmetic that is neither provable nor disprovable in Peano's arithmetic. Moreover, this statement is true in the usual model. In addition, no effectively axiomatized, consistent extension of Peano arithmetic can be complete.\n\n Consistency \nA set of axioms is (simply) consistent if there is no statement such that both the statement and its negation are provable from the axioms, and inconsistent otherwise.\n\nPeano arithmetic is provably consistent from ZFC, but not from within itself. Similarly, ZFC is not provably consistent from within itself, but ZFC + \"there exists an inaccessible cardinal\" proves ZFC is consistent because if  is the least such cardinal, then  sitting inside the von Neumann universe is a model of ZFC, and a theory is consistent if and only if it has a model.\n\nIf one takes all statements in the language of Peano arithmetic as axioms, then this theory is complete, has a recursively enumerable set of axioms, and can describe addition and multiplication. However, it is not consistent.\n\nAdditional examples of inconsistent theories arise from the paradoxes that result when the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is assumed in set theory.\n\n Systems which contain arithmetic \n\nThe incompleteness theorems apply only to formal systems which are able to prove a sufficient collection of facts about the natural numbers. One sufficient collection is the set of theorems of Robinson arithmetic Q.  Some systems, such as Peano arithmetic, can directly express statements about natural numbers. Others, such as ZFC set theory, are able to interpret statements about natural numbers into their language. Either of these options is appropriate for the incompleteness theorems.\n\nThe theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic is complete, consistent, and has an infinite but recursively enumerable set of axioms. However it is not possible to encode the integers into this theory, and the theory cannot describe arithmetic of integers.  A similar example is the theory of real closed fields, which is essentially equivalent to Tarski's axioms for Euclidean geometry. So Euclidean geometry itself (in Tarski's formulation) is an example of a complete, consistent, effectively axiomatized theory.\n\nThe system of Presburger arithmetic consists of a set of axioms for the natural numbers with just the addition operation (multiplication is omitted). Presburger arithmetic is complete, consistent, and recursively enumerable and can encode addition but not multiplication of natural numbers, showing that for G\u00f6del's theorems one needs the theory to encode not just addition but also multiplication.\n\nDan Willard (2001) has studied some weak families of arithmetic systems which allow enough arithmetic as relations to formalise G\u00f6del numbering, but which are not strong enough to have multiplication as a function, and so fail to prove the second incompleteness theorem; these systems are consistent and capable of proving their own consistency (see self-verifying theories).\n\n Conflicting goals \nIn choosing a set of axioms, one goal is to be able to prove as many correct results as possible, without proving any incorrect results. For example, we could imagine a set of true axioms which allow us to prove every true arithmetical claim about the natural numbers (Smith 2007, p\u00a02). In the standard system of first-order logic, an inconsistent set of axioms will prove every statement in its language (this is sometimes called the principle of explosion), and is thus automatically complete. A set of axioms that is both complete and consistent, however, proves a maximal set of non-contradictory theorems (Hinman 2005, p.\u00a0143).\n\nThe pattern illustrated in the previous sections with Peano arithmetic, ZFC, and ZFC + \"there exists an inaccessible cardinal\" cannot generally be broken. Here ZFC + \"there exists an inaccessible cardinal\" cannot from itself, be proved consistent. It is also not complete, as illustrated by the in ZFC + \"there exists an inaccessible cardinal\" theory unresolved continuum hypothesis.\n\nThe first incompleteness theorem shows that, in formal systems that can express basic arithmetic, a complete and consistent finite list of axioms can never be created: each time an additional, consistent statement is added as an axiom, there are other true statements that still cannot be proved, even with the new axiom. If an axiom is ever added that makes the system complete, it does so at the cost of making the system inconsistent. It is not even possible for an infinite list of axioms to be complete, consistent, and effectively axiomatized.\n\n First incompleteness theorem \n\nG\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem first appeared as \"Theorem VI\" in G\u00f6del's 1931 paper \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\".  The hypotheses of the theorem were improved shortly thereafter by J. Barkley Rosser (1936) using Rosser's trick. The resulting theorem (incorporating Rosser's improvement) may be paraphrased in English as follows, where \"formal system\" includes the assumption that the system is effectively generated.\n\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem: \"Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.\" (Raatikainen\u00a02015)\n\nThe unprovable statement GF referred to by the theorem is often referred to as \"the G\u00f6del sentence\"  for the system F. The proof constructs a particular G\u00f6del sentence for the system F, but there are infinitely many statements in the language of the system that share the same properties, such as the conjunction of the G\u00f6del sentence and any logically valid sentence.\n\nEach effectively generated system has its own G\u00f6del sentence. It is possible to define a larger system F\u2019\u00a0that contains the whole of F plus GF as an additional axiom. This will not result in a complete system, because G\u00f6del's theorem will also apply to F\u2019, and thus F\u2019 also cannot be complete.  In this case, GF is indeed a theorem in F\u2019, because it is an axiom. Because GF states only that it is not provable in F, no contradiction is presented by its provability within F\u2019.  However, because the incompleteness theorem applies to F\u2019, there will be a new G\u00f6del statement GF\u2032 for F\u2019, showing that F\u2019 is also incomplete.  GF\u2032 will differ from GF in that  GF\u2032 will refer to F\u2019, rather than\u00a0F.\n\n Syntactic form of the G\u00f6del sentence \n\nThe G\u00f6del sentence is designed to refer, indirectly, to itself. The sentence states that, when a particular sequence of steps is used to construct another sentence, that constructed sentence will not be provable in F. However, the sequence of steps is such that the constructed sentence turns out to be GF itself. In this way, the G\u00f6del sentence GF indirectly states its own unprovability within F (Smith 2007, p.\u00a0135).\n\nTo prove the first incompleteness theorem, G\u00f6del demonstrated that the notion of provability within a system could be expressed purely in terms of arithmetical functions that operate on G\u00f6del numbers of sentences of the system. Therefore, the system, which can prove certain facts about numbers, can also indirectly prove facts about its own statements, provided that it is effectively generated. Questions about the provability of statements within the system are represented as questions about the arithmetical properties of numbers themselves, which would be decidable by the system if it were complete.\n\nThus, although the G\u00f6del sentence refers indirectly to sentences of the system F, when read as an arithmetical statement the G\u00f6del sentence directly refers only to natural numbers. It asserts that no natural number has a particular property, where that property is given by a primitive recursive relation (Smith 2007, p.\u00a0141).   As such, the G\u00f6del sentence can be written in the language of arithmetic with a simple syntactic form. In particular, it can be expressed as a formula in the language of arithmetic consisting of a number of leading universal quantifiers followed by a quantifier-free body (these formulas are at level  of the arithmetical hierarchy).  Via the MRDP theorem, the G\u00f6del sentence can be re-written as a statement that a particular polynomial in many variables with integer coefficients never takes the value zero when integers are substituted for its variables (Franz\u00e9n 2005, p.\u00a071).\n\n Truth of the G\u00f6del sentence \n\nThe first incompleteness theorem shows that the G\u00f6del sentence  GF of an appropriate formal theory F is unprovable in F. Because, when interpreted as a statement about arithmetic, this unprovability is exactly what the sentence (indirectly) asserts, the G\u00f6del sentence is, in fact, true (Smory\u0144ski 1977 p.\u00a0825; also see Franz\u00e9n 2005 pp.\u00a028\u201333). For this reason, the sentence GF is often said to be \"true but unprovable.\" (Raatikainen 2015).  However, since the G\u00f6del sentence cannot itself formally specify its intended interpretation, the truth of the sentence GF may only be arrived at via a meta-analysis from outside the system. In general, this meta-analysis can be carried out within the weak formal system known as primitive recursive arithmetic, which proves the implication Con(F)\u2192GF, where Con(F) is a canonical sentence asserting the consistency of F (Smory\u0144ski 1977 p.\u00a0840, Kikuchi and Tanaka 1994 p.\u00a0403).\n\nAlthough the G\u00f6del sentence of a consistent theory is true as a statement about the intended interpretation of arithmetic, the G\u00f6del sentence will be false in some nonstandard models of arithmetic, as a consequence of G\u00f6del's completeness theorem (Franz\u00e9n 2005, p.\u00a0135).  That theorem shows that, when a sentence is independent of a theory, the theory will have models in which the sentence is true and models in which the sentence is false.  As described earlier, the G\u00f6del sentence of a system F is an arithmetical statement which claims that no number exists with a particular property. The incompleteness theorem shows that this claim will be independent of the system F, and the truth of the G\u00f6del sentence follows from the fact that no standard natural number has the property in question. Any model in which the G\u00f6del sentence is false must contain some element which satisfies the property within that model. Such a model must be \"nonstandard\" \u2013 it must contain elements that do not correspond to any standard natural number (Raatikainen 2015, Franz\u00e9n 2005, p.\u00a0135).\n\n Relationship with the liar paradox \n\nG\u00f6del specifically cites Richard's paradox and the liar paradox as semantical analogues to his syntactical incompleteness result in the introductory section of \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\".  The liar paradox is the sentence \"This sentence is false.\"  An analysis of the liar sentence shows that it cannot be true (for then, as it asserts, it is false), nor can it be false (for then, it is true). A G\u00f6del sentence G for a system F makes a similar assertion to the liar sentence, but with truth replaced by provability: G says \"G is not provable in the system F.\"  The analysis of the truth and provability of G is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.\n\nIt is not possible to replace \"not provable\" with \"false\" in a G\u00f6del sentence because the predicate \"Q is the G\u00f6del number of a false formula\" cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as Tarski's undefinability theorem, was discovered independently both by G\u00f6del, when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem, and by the theorem's namesake, Alfred Tarski.\n\n Extensions of G\u00f6del's original result \n\nCompared to the theorems stated in G\u00f6del's 1931 paper, many contemporary statements of the incompleteness theorems are more general in two ways. These generalized statements are phrased to apply to a broader class of systems, and they are phrased to incorporate weaker consistency assumptions.\n\nG\u00f6del demonstrated the incompleteness of the system of Principia Mathematica, a particular system of arithmetic, but a parallel demonstration could be given for any effective system of a certain expressiveness. G\u00f6del commented on this fact in the introduction to his paper, but restricted the proof to one system for concreteness.  In modern statements of the theorem, it is common to state the effectiveness and expressiveness conditions as hypotheses for the incompleteness theorem, so that it is not limited to any particular formal system. The terminology used to state these conditions was not yet developed in 1931 when G\u00f6del published his results.\n\nG\u00f6del's original statement and proof of the incompleteness theorem requires the assumption that the system is not just consistent but \u03c9-consistent. A system is \u03c9-consistent if it is not \u03c9-inconsistent, and is \u03c9-inconsistent if there is a predicate P such that for every specific natural number m the system proves ~P(m), and yet the system also proves that there exists a natural number n such that P(n). That is, the system says that a number with property P exists while denying that it has any specific value. The \u03c9-consistency of a system implies its consistency, but consistency does not imply \u03c9-consistency. J. Barkley Rosser (1936) strengthened the incompleteness theorem by finding a variation of the proof (Rosser's trick) that only requires the system to be consistent, rather than \u03c9-consistent. This is mostly of technical interest, because all true formal theories of arithmetic (theories whose axioms are all true statements about natural numbers) are \u03c9-consistent, and thus G\u00f6del's theorem as originally stated applies to them. The stronger version of the incompleteness theorem that only assumes consistency, rather than \u03c9-consistency, is now commonly known as G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem and as the G\u00f6del\u2013Rosser theorem.\n\n Second incompleteness theorem \n\nFor each formal system F containing basic arithmetic, it is possible to canonically define a formula Cons(F) expressing the consistency of F. This formula expresses the property that \"there does not exist a natural number coding a formal derivation within the system F whose conclusion is a syntactic contradiction.\"   The syntactic contradiction is often taken to be \"0=1\", in which case Cons(F) states \"there is no natural number that codes a derivation of '0=1' from the axioms of F.\"\n\nG\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem shows that, under general assumptions, this canonical consistency statement Cons(F) will not be provable in F. The theorem first appeared as \"Theorem XI\" in G\u00f6del's 1931 paper \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\". In the following statement, the term \"formalized system\" also includes an assumption that F is effectively axiomatized. \nSecond Incompleteness Theorem: \"Assume F is a consistent formalized system which contains elementary arithmetic. Then .\" (Raatikainen 2015)\n\nThis theorem is stronger than the first incompleteness theorem because the statement constructed in the first incompleteness theorem does not directly express the consistency of the system. The proof of the second incompleteness theorem is obtained by formalizing the proof of the first incompleteness theorem within the system F itself.\n\n Expressing consistency \n\nThere is a technical subtlety in the second incompleteness theorem regarding the method of expressing the consistency of F as a formula in the language of F. There are many ways to express the consistency of a system, and not all of them lead to the same result.  The formula Cons(F) from the second incompleteness theorem is a particular expression of consistency.\n\nOther formalizations of the claim that F is consistent may be inequivalent in F, and some may even be provable. For example, first-order Peano arithmetic (PA) can prove that \"the largest consistent subset of PA\" is consistent. But, because PA is consistent, the largest consistent subset of PA is just PA, so in this sense PA \"proves that it is consistent\". What PA does not prove is that the largest consistent subset of PA is, in fact, the whole of PA. (The term \"largest consistent subset of PA\" is meant here to be the largest consistent initial segment of the axioms of PA under some particular effective enumeration).\n\n The Hilbert\u2013Bernays conditions \n\nThe standard proof of the second incompleteness theorem assumes that the provability predicate ProvA(P) satisfies the Hilbert\u2013Bernays provability conditions. Letting #(P) represent the G\u00f6del number of a formula P, the derivability conditions say:\n\n If F proves P, then F proves ProvA(#(P)).\n F proves 1.; that is, F proves that if F proves P, then F proves ProvA(#(P)). In other words, F proves that ProvA(#(P)) implies ProvA(#(ProvA(#(P)))).\n F proves that if F proves that (P \u2192 Q) and F proves P then F proves Q. In other words, F proves that ProvA(#(P \u2192 Q)) and ProvA(#(P)) imply ProvA(#(Q)).\n\nThere are systems, such as Robinson arithmetic, which are strong enough to meet the assumptions of the first incompleteness theorem, but which do not prove the Hilbert\u2014Bernays conditions. Peano arithmetic, however, is strong enough to verify these conditions, as are all theories stronger than Peano arithmetic.\n\n Implications for consistency proofs \n\nG\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem also implies that a system F1 satisfying the technical conditions outlined above cannot prove the consistency of any system F2 that proves the consistency of F1. This is because such a system F1 can prove that if F2 proves the consistency of F1, then F1 is in fact consistent. For the claim that F1 is consistent has form \"for all numbers n, n has the decidable property of not being a code for a proof of contradiction in F1\". If F1 were in fact inconsistent, then F2 would prove for some n that n is the code of a contradiction in F1. But if F2 also proved that F1 is consistent (that is, that there is no such n), then it would itself be inconsistent. This reasoning can be formalized in F1 to show that if F2 is consistent, then F1 is consistent. Since, by second incompleteness theorem, F1 does not prove its consistency, it cannot prove the consistency of F2 either.\n\nThis corollary of the second incompleteness theorem shows that there is no hope of proving, for example, the consistency of Peano arithmetic using any finitistic means that can be formalized in a system the consistency of which is provable in Peano arithmetic (PA). For example, the system of primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA), which is widely accepted as an accurate formalization of finitistic mathematics, is provably consistent in PA. Thus PRA cannot prove the consistency of PA. This fact is generally seen to imply that Hilbert's program, which aimed to justify the use of \"ideal\" (infinitistic) mathematical principles in the proofs of \"real\" (finitistic) mathematical statements by giving a finitistic proof that the ideal principles are consistent, cannot be carried out (Franz\u00e9n 2005, p.\u00a0106).\n\nThe corollary also indicates the epistemological relevance of the second incompleteness theorem. It would actually provide no interesting information if a system F proved its consistency. This is because inconsistent theories prove everything, including their consistency. Thus a consistency proof of F in F would give us no clue as to whether F really is consistent; no doubts about the consistency of F would be resolved by such a consistency proof. The interest in consistency proofs lies in the possibility of proving the consistency of a system F in some system F\u2019 that is in some sense less doubtful than F itself, for example weaker than F. For many naturally occurring theories F and F\u2019, such as F = Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory and F\u2019 = primitive recursive arithmetic, the consistency of F\u2019 is provable in F, and thus F\u2019 cannot prove the consistency of F by the above corollary of the second incompleteness theorem.\n\nThe second incompleteness theorem does not rule out consistency proofs altogether, only consistency proofs that can be formalized in the system that is proved consistent. For example, Gerhard Gentzen proved the consistency of Peano arithmetic in a different system that includes an axiom asserting that the ordinal called \u03b50 is wellfounded; see Gentzen's consistency proof. Gentzen's theorem spurred the development of ordinal analysis in proof theory.\n\n Examples of undecidable statements \n\nThere are two distinct senses of the word \"undecidable\" in mathematics and computer science. The first of these is the proof-theoretic sense used in relation to G\u00f6del's theorems, that of a statement being neither provable nor refutable in a specified deductive system.  The second sense, which will not be discussed here, is used in relation to computability theory and applies not to statements but to decision problems, which are countably infinite sets of questions each requiring a yes or no answer. Such a problem is said to be undecidable if there is no computable function that correctly answers every question in the problem set (see undecidable problem).\n\nBecause of the two meanings of the word undecidable, the term independent is sometimes used instead of undecidable for the \"neither provable nor refutable\" sense.\n\nUndecidability of a statement in a particular deductive system does not, in and of itself, address the question of whether the truth value of the statement is well-defined, or whether it can be determined by other means. Undecidability only implies that the particular deductive system being considered does not prove the truth or falsity of the statement. Whether there exist so-called \"absolutely undecidable\" statements, whose truth value can never be known or is ill-specified, is a controversial point in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nThe combined work of G\u00f6del and Paul Cohen has given two concrete examples of undecidable statements (in the first sense of the term): The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor refuted in ZFC (the standard axiomatization of set theory), and the axiom of choice can neither be proved nor refuted in ZF (which is all the ZFC axioms except the axiom of choice).  These results do not require the incompleteness theorem.   G\u00f6del proved in 1940 that neither of these statements could be disproved in ZF or ZFC set theory. In the 1960s, Cohen proved that neither is provable from ZF, and the continuum hypothesis cannot be proved from ZFC.\n\nIn 1973, Saharon Shelah showed that the Whitehead problem in group theory is undecidable, in the first sense of the term, in standard set theory.\n\nGregory Chaitin produced undecidable statements in algorithmic information theory and proved another incompleteness theorem in that setting. Chaitin's incompleteness theorem states that for any system that can represent enough arithmetic, there is an upper bound c such that no specific number can be proved in that system to have Kolmogorov complexity greater than c. While G\u00f6del's theorem is related to the liar paradox, Chaitin's result is related to Berry's paradox.\n\n Undecidable statements provable in larger systems \n\nThese are natural mathematical equivalents of the G\u00f6del \"true but undecidable\" sentence. They can be proved in a larger system which is generally accepted as a valid form of reasoning, but are undecidable in a more limited system such as Peano Arithmetic.\n\nIn 1977, Paris and Harrington proved that the Paris\u2013Harrington principle, a version of the infinite Ramsey theorem, is undecidable in (first-order) Peano arithmetic, but can be proved in the stronger system of second-order arithmetic. Kirby and Paris later showed that Goodstein's theorem, a statement about sequences of natural numbers somewhat simpler than the Paris\u2013Harrington principle, is also undecidable in Peano arithmetic.\n\nKruskal's tree theorem, which has applications in computer science, is also undecidable from Peano arithmetic but provable in set theory. In fact Kruskal's tree theorem (or its finite form) is undecidable in a much stronger system codifying the principles acceptable based on a philosophy of mathematics called predicativism.  The related but more general graph minor theorem (2003) has consequences for computational complexity theory.\n\n Relationship with computability \n\nThe incompleteness theorem is closely related to several results about undecidable sets in recursion theory.\n\nStephen Cole Kleene (1943) presented a proof of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem using basic results of computability theory. One such result shows that the halting problem is undecidable: there is no computer program that can correctly determine, given any program P as input, whether P eventually halts when run with a particular given input. Kleene showed that the existence of a complete effective system of arithmetic with certain consistency properties would force the halting problem to be decidable, a contradiction. This method of proof has also been presented by Shoenfield (1967, p.\u00a0132); Charlesworth (1980); and Hopcroft and Ullman (1979).\n\nFranz\u00e9n (2005, p.\u00a073) explains how Matiyasevich's solution to Hilbert's 10th problem can be used to obtain a proof to G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem. Matiyasevich proved that there is no algorithm that, given a multivariate polynomial p(x1, x2,...,xk) with integer coefficients, determines whether there is an integer solution to the equation p = 0. Because polynomials with integer coefficients, and integers themselves, are directly expressible in the language of arithmetic, if a multivariate integer polynomial equation p = 0 does have a solution in the integers then any sufficiently strong system of arithmetic T will prove this. Moreover, if the system T is \u03c9-consistent, then it will never prove that a particular polynomial equation has a solution when in fact there is no solution in the integers. Thus, if T were complete and \u03c9-consistent, it would be possible to determine algorithmically whether a polynomial equation has a solution by merely enumerating proofs of T until either \"p has a solution\" or \"p has no solution\" is found, in contradiction to Matiyasevich's theorem. Moreover, for each consistent effectively generated system T, it is possible to effectively generate a multivariate polynomial p over the integers such that the equation p = 0 has no solutions over the integers, but the lack of solutions cannot be proved in T (Davis 2006:416, Jones 1980).\n\nSmorynski (1977, p.\u00a0842) shows how the existence of recursively inseparable sets can be used to prove the first incompleteness theorem. This proof is often extended to show that systems such as Peano arithmetic are essentially undecidable (see Kleene 1967, p.\u00a0274).\n\nChaitin's incompleteness theorem gives a different method of producing independent sentences, based on Kolmogorov complexity. Like the proof presented by Kleene that was mentioned above, Chaitin's theorem only applies to theories with the additional property that all their axioms are true in the standard model of the natural numbers. G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem is distinguished by its applicability to consistent theories that nonetheless include statements that are false in the standard model; these theories are known as \u03c9-inconsistent.\n\n Proof sketch for the first theorem \n\nThe proof by contradiction has three essential parts. To begin, choose a formal system that meets the proposed criteria:\n\n Statements in the system can be represented by natural numbers (known as G\u00f6del numbers). The significance of this is that properties of statements\u2014such as their truth and falsehood\u2014will be equivalent to determining whether their G\u00f6del numbers have certain properties, and that properties of the statements can therefore be demonstrated by examining their G\u00f6del numbers. This part culminates in the construction of a formula expressing the idea that \"statement S is provable in the system\" (which can be applied to any statement \"S\" in the system).\n In the formal system it is possible to construct a number whose matching statement, when interpreted, is self-referential and essentially says that it (i.e. the statement itself) is unprovable. This is done using a technique called \"diagonalization\" (so-called because of its origins as Cantor's diagonal argument).\n Within the formal system this statement permits a demonstration that it is neither provable nor disprovable in the system, and therefore the system cannot in fact be \u03c9-consistent. Hence the original assumption that the proposed system met the criteria is false.\n\n Arithmetization of syntax \n\nThe main problem in fleshing out the proof described above is that it seems at first that to construct a statement p that is equivalent to \"p cannot be proved\", p would somehow have to contain a reference to p, which could easily give rise to an infinite regress. G\u00f6del's ingenious technique is to show that statements can be matched with numbers (often called the arithmetization of syntax) in such a way that \"proving a statement\" can be replaced with \"testing whether a number has a given property\". This allows a self-referential formula to be constructed in a way that avoids any infinite regress of definitions. The same technique was later used by Alan Turing in his work on the Entscheidungsproblem.\n\nIn simple terms, a method can be devised so that every formula or statement that can be formulated in the system gets a unique number, called its G\u00f6del number, in such a way that it is possible to mechanically convert back and forth between formulas and G\u00f6del numbers.  The numbers involved might be very long indeed (in terms of number of digits), but this is not a barrier; all that matters is that such numbers can be constructed. A simple example is the way in which English is stored as a sequence of numbers in computers using ASCII or Unicode:\n The word HELLO is represented by 72-69-76-76-79 using decimal ASCII, i.e. the number 7269767679.\n The logical statement x=y => y=x is represented by 120-061-121-032-061-062-032-121-061-120 using octal ASCII, i.e. the number 120061121032061062032121061120.\n\nIn principle, proving a statement true or false can be shown to be equivalent to proving that the number matching the statement does or doesn't have a given property. Because the formal system is strong enough to support reasoning about numbers in general, it can support reasoning about numbers that represent formulae and statements as well. Crucially, because the system can support reasoning about properties of numbers, the results are equivalent to reasoning about provability of their equivalent statements.\n\n Construction of a statement about \"provability\" \n\nHaving shown that in principle the system can indirectly make statements about provability, by analyzing properties of those numbers representing statements it is now possible to show how to create a statement that actually does this.\n\nA formula F(x) that contains exactly one free variable x is called a statement form or class-sign. As soon as x is replaced by a specific number, the statement form turns into a bona fide statement, and it is then either provable in the system, or not. For certain formulas one can show that for every natural number n, F(n) is true if and only if it can be proved (the precise requirement in the original proof is weaker, but for the proof sketch this will suffice). In particular, this is true for every specific arithmetic operation between a finite number of natural numbers, such as \"2\u00d73=6\".\n\nStatement forms themselves are not statements and therefore cannot be proved or disproved. But every statement form F(x) can be assigned a G\u00f6del number denoted by G(F). The choice of the free variable used in the form F(x) is not relevant to the assignment of the G\u00f6del number G(F).\n\nThe notion of provability itself can also be encoded by G\u00f6del numbers, in the following way: since a proof is a list of statements which obey certain rules, the G\u00f6del number of a proof can be defined. Now, for every statement p, one may ask whether a number x is the G\u00f6del number of its proof. The relation between the G\u00f6del number of p and x, the potential G\u00f6del number of its proof, is an arithmetical relation between two numbers.  Therefore, there is a statement form Bew(y) that uses this arithmetical relation to state that a G\u00f6del number of a proof of y exists:\nBew(y) = \u2203 x ( y is the G\u00f6del number of a formula and x is the G\u00f6del number of a proof of the formula encoded by y).\nThe name Bew is short for beweisbar, the German word for \"provable\"; this name was originally used by G\u00f6del to denote the provability formula just described.  Note that \"Bew(y)\" is merely an abbreviation that represents a particular, very long, formula in the original language of T; the string \"Bew\" itself is not claimed to be part of this language.\n\nAn important feature of the formula Bew(y) is that if a statement p is provable in the system then Bew(G(p)) is also provable. This is because any proof of p would have a corresponding G\u00f6del number, the existence of which causes Bew(G(p)) to be satisfied.\n\n Diagonalization \n\nThe next step in the proof is to obtain a statement which, indirectly, asserts its own unprovability. Although G\u00f6del constructed this statement directly, the existence of at least one such statement follows from the diagonal lemma, which says that for any sufficiently strong formal system and any statement form F there is a statement p such that the system proves\np \u2194 F(G(p)).\nBy letting F be the negation of Bew(x), we obtain the theorem\np \u2194 ~Bew(G(p))\nand the p defined by this roughly states that its own G\u00f6del number is the G\u00f6del number of an unprovable formula.\n\nThe statement p is not literally equal to ~Bew(G(p)); rather, p states that if a certain calculation is performed, the resulting G\u00f6del number will be that of an unprovable statement. But when this calculation is performed, the resulting G\u00f6del number turns out to be the G\u00f6del number of p itself. This is similar to the following sentence in English:\n\", when preceded by itself in quotes, is unprovable.\", when preceded by itself in quotes, is unprovable.\nThis sentence does not directly refer to itself, but when the stated transformation is made the original sentence is obtained as a result, and thus this sentence indirectly asserts its own unprovability. The proof of the diagonal lemma employs a similar method.\n\nNow, assume that the axiomatic system is \u03c9-consistent, and let p be the statement obtained in the previous section.\n\nIf p were provable, then Bew(G(p)) would be provable, as argued above. But p asserts the negation of Bew(G(p)). Thus the system would be inconsistent, proving both a statement and its negation.  This contradiction shows that p cannot be provable.\n\nIf the negation of p were provable, then Bew(G(p)) would be provable (because p was constructed to be equivalent to the negation of Bew(G(p))). However, for each specific number x, x cannot be the G\u00f6del number of the proof of p, because p is not provable (from the previous paragraph). Thus on one hand the system proves there is a number with a certain property (that it is the G\u00f6del number of the proof of p), but on the other hand, for every specific number x, we can prove that it does not have this property. This is impossible in an \u03c9-consistent system. Thus the negation of p is not provable.\n\nThus the statement p is undecidable in our axiomatic system: it can neither be proved nor disproved within the system.\n\nIn fact, to show that p is not provable only requires the assumption that the system is consistent. The stronger assumption of \u03c9-consistency is required to show that the negation of p is not provable. Thus, if p is constructed for a particular system:\nIf the system is \u03c9-consistent, it can prove neither p nor its negation, and so p is undecidable.\nIf the system is consistent, it may have the same situation, or it may prove the negation of p. In the later case, we have a statement (\"not p\") which is false but provable, and the system is not \u03c9-consistent.\n\nIf one tries to \"add the missing axioms\" to avoid the incompleteness of the system, then one has to add either p or \"not p\" as axioms. But then the definition of \"being a G\u00f6del number of a proof\" of a statement changes. which means that the formula Bew(x) is now different. Thus when we apply the diagonal lemma to this new Bew, we obtain a new statement p, different from the previous one, which will be undecidable in the new system if it is \u03c9-consistent.\n\n Proof via Berry's paradox \nGeorge Boolos (1989) sketches an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses Berry's paradox rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula. A similar proof method was independently discovered by Saul Kripke (Boolos 1998, p.\u00a0383).  Boolos's proof proceeds by constructing, for any computably enumerable set S of true sentences of arithmetic, another sentence which is true but not contained in S. This gives the first incompleteness theorem as a corollary. According to Boolos, this proof is interesting because it provides a \"different sort of reason\" for the incompleteness of effective, consistent theories of arithmetic (Boolos 1998, p.\u00a0388).\n\n Computer verified proofs \n\nThe incompleteness theorems are among a relatively small number of nontrivial theorems that have been transformed into formalized theorems that can be completely verified by proof assistant software. G\u00f6del's original proofs of the incompleteness theorems, like most mathematical proofs, were written in natural language intended for human readers.\n\nComputer-verified proofs of versions of the first incompleteness theorem were announced by Natarajan Shankar in 1986 using Nqthm (Shankar 1994), by Russell O'Connor in 2003 using Coq (O'Connor 2005) and by John Harrison in 2009 using HOL Light (Harrison 2009). A computer-verified proof of both incompleteness theorems was announced by Lawrence Paulson in 2013 using Isabelle (Paulson 2014).\n\n Proof sketch for the second theorem \n\nThe main difficulty in proving the second incompleteness theorem is to show that various facts about provability used in the proof of the first incompleteness theorem can be formalized within the system using a formal predicate for provability. Once this is done, the second incompleteness theorem follows by formalizing the entire proof of the first incompleteness theorem within the system itself.\n\nLet p stand for the undecidable sentence constructed above, and assume that the consistency of the system can be proved from within the system itself. The demonstration above shows that if the system is consistent, then p is not provable. The proof of this implication can be formalized within the system, and therefore the statement \"p is not provable\", or \"not P(p)\" can be proved in the system.\n\nBut this last statement is equivalent to p itself (and this equivalence can be proved in the system), so p can be proved in the system. This contradiction shows that the system must be inconsistent.\n\n Discussion and implications \n\nThe incompleteness results affect the philosophy of mathematics, particularly versions of formalism, which use a single system of formal logic to define their principles.\n\n Consequences for logicism and Hilbert's second problem \n\nThe incompleteness theorem is sometimes thought to have severe consequences for the program of logicism proposed by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, which aimed to define the natural numbers in terms of logic (Hellman 1981, p.\u00a0451\u2013468). Bob Hale and Crispin Wright argue that it is not a problem for logicism because the incompleteness theorems apply equally to first order logic as they do to arithmetic. They argue that only those who believe that the natural numbers are to be defined in terms of first order logic have this problem.\n\nMany logicians believe that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems struck a fatal blow to David Hilbert's second problem, which asked for a finitary consistency proof for mathematics. The second incompleteness theorem, in particular, is often viewed as making the problem impossible. Not all mathematicians agree with this analysis, however, and the status of Hilbert's second problem is not yet decided (see \"Modern viewpoints on the status of the problem\").\n\n Minds and machines \n\nAuthors including the philosopher J. R. Lucas and physicist Roger Penrose have debated what, if anything, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems imply about human intelligence. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a Turing machine, or by the Church\u2013Turing thesis, any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is consistent, then G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.\n\nHilary Putnam (1960) suggested that while G\u00f6del's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. Assuming that it is consistent, either its consistency cannot be proved or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.\n\nAvi Wigderson (2010) has proposed that the concept of mathematical \"knowability\" should be based on computational complexity rather than logical decidability.  He writes that \"when knowability is interpreted by modern standards, namely via computational complexity, the G\u00f6del phenomena are very much with us.\"\n\nDouglas Hofstadter, in his books G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach and I Am a Strange Loop, cites G\u00f6del's theorems as an example of what he calls a strange loop, a hierarchical, self-referential structure existing within an axiomatic formal system. He argues that this is the same kind of structure which gives rise to consciousness, the sense of \"I\", in the human mind. While the self-reference in G\u00f6del's theorem comes from the G\u00f6del sentence asserting its own unprovability within the formal system of Principia Mathematica, the self-reference in the human mind comes from the way in which the brain abstracts and categorises stimuli into \"symbols\", or groups of neurons which respond to concepts, in what is effectively also a formal system, eventually giving rise to symbols modelling the concept of the very entity doing the perception.\nHofstadter argues that a strange loop in a sufficiently complex formal system can give rise to a \"downward\" or \"upside-down\" causality, a situation in which the normal hierarchy of cause-and-effect is flipped upside-down. In the case of G\u00f6del's theorem, this manifests, in short, as the following:\n\n\"Merely from knowing the formula's meaning, one can infer its truth or falsity without any effort to derive it in the old-fashioned way, which requires one to trudge methodically \"upwards\" from the axioms. This is not just peculiar; it is astonishing. Normally, one cannot merely look at what a mathematical conjecture says and simply appeal to the content of that statement on its own to deduce whether the statement is true or false.\" (I Am a Strange Loop.)\n\nIn the case of the mind, a far more complex formal system, this \"downward causality\" manifests, in Hofstadter's view, as the ineffable human instinct that the causality of our minds lies on the high level of desires, concepts, personalities, thoughts and ideas, rather than on the low level of interactions between neurons or even fundamental particles, even though according to physics the latter seems to possess the causal power.\n\n\"There is thus a curious upside-downness to our normal human way of perceiving the world: we are built to perceive \u201cbig stuff\u201d rather than \u201csmall stuff\u201d, even though the domain of the tiny seems to be where the actual motors driving reality reside.\" (I Am a Strange Loop.)\n\n Paraconsistent logic \n\nAlthough G\u00f6del's theorems are usually studied in the context of classical logic, they also have a role in the study of paraconsistent logic and of inherently contradictory statements (dialetheia). Graham Priest (1984, 2006) argues that replacing the notion of formal proof in G\u00f6del's theorem with the usual notion of informal proof can be used to show that naive mathematics is inconsistent, and uses this as evidence for dialetheism. The cause of this inconsistency is the inclusion of a truth predicate for a system within the language of the system (Priest 2006:47). Stewart Shapiro (2002) gives a more mixed appraisal of the applications of G\u00f6del's theorems to dialetheism.\n\n Appeals to the incompleteness theorems in other fields \n\nAppeals and analogies are sometimes made to the incompleteness theorems in support of arguments that go beyond mathematics and logic. Several authors have commented negatively on such extensions and interpretations, including Torkel Franz\u00e9n (2005); Panu Raatikainen (2005); Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont (1999); and Ophelia Benson and Jeremy Stangroom (2006). Bricmont and Stangroom (2006, p.\u00a010), for example, quote from Rebecca Goldstein's comments on the disparity between G\u00f6del's avowed Platonism and the anti-realist uses to which his ideas are sometimes put. Sokal and Bricmont (1999, p.\u00a0187) criticize R\u00e9gis Debray's invocation of the theorem in the context of sociology; Debray has defended this use as metaphorical (ibid.).\n\n History \n\nAfter G\u00f6del published his proof of the completeness theorem as his doctoral thesis in 1929, he turned to a second problem for his habilitation. His original goal was to obtain a positive solution to Hilbert's second problem (Dawson 1997, p.\u00a063). At the time, theories of the natural numbers and real numbers similar to second-order arithmetic were known as \"analysis\", while theories of the natural numbers alone were known as \"arithmetic\".\n\nG\u00f6del was not the only person working on the consistency problem. Ackermann had published a flawed consistency proof for analysis in 1925, in which he attempted to use the method of \u03b5-substitution originally developed by Hilbert. Later that year, von Neumann was able to correct the proof for a system of arithmetic without any axioms of induction. By 1928, Ackermann had communicated a modified proof to Bernays; this modified proof led Hilbert to announce his belief in 1929 that the consistency of arithmetic had been demonstrated and that a consistency proof of analysis would likely soon follow. After the publication of the incompleteness theorems showed that Ackermann's modified proof must be erroneous, von Neumann produced a concrete example showing that its main technique was unsound (Zach 2006, p.\u00a0418, Zach 2003, p.\u00a033).\n\nIn the course of his research, G\u00f6del discovered that although a sentence which asserts its own falsehood leads to paradox, a sentence that asserts its own non-provability does not. In particular, G\u00f6del was aware of the result now called Tarski's indefinability theorem, although he never published it. G\u00f6del announced his first incompleteness theorem to Carnap, Feigel and Waismann on August 26, 1930; all four would attend a key conference in K\u00f6nigsberg the following week.\n\n Announcement \nThe 1930 K\u00f6nigsberg conference was a joint meeting of three academic societies, with many of the key logicians of the time in attendance. Carnap, Heyting, and von Neumann delivered one-hour addresses on the mathematical philosophies of logicism, intuitionism, and formalism, respectively (Dawson 1996, p.\u00a069). The conference also included Hilbert's retirement address, as he was leaving his position at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Hilbert used the speech to argue his belief that all mathematical problems can be solved. He ended his address by saying,\n\nThis speech quickly became known as a summary of Hilbert's beliefs on mathematics (its final six words, \"Wir m\u00fcssen wissen. Wir werden wissen!\", were used as Hilbert's epitaph in 1943). Although G\u00f6del was likely in attendance for Hilbert's address, the two never met face to face (Dawson 1996, p.\u00a072).\n\nG\u00f6del announced his first incompleteness theorem at a roundtable discussion session on the third day of the conference. The announcement drew little attention apart from that of von Neumann, who pulled G\u00f6del aside for conversation. Later that year, working independently with knowledge of the first incompleteness theorem, von Neumann obtained a proof of the second incompleteness theorem, which he announced to G\u00f6del in a letter dated November 20, 1930 (Dawson 1996, p.\u00a070). G\u00f6del had independently obtained the second incompleteness theorem and included it in his submitted manuscript, which was received by Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik on November 17, 1930.\n\nG\u00f6del's paper was published in the Monatshefte in 1931 under the title \"\u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I\" (\"On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\"). As the title implies, G\u00f6del originally planned to publish a second part of the paper in the next volume of the Monatshefte; the prompt acceptance of the first paper was one reason he changed his plans (van Heijenoort 1967:328, footnote 68a).\n\n Generalization and acceptance \n\nG\u00f6del gave a series of lectures on his theorems at Princeton in 1933\u20131934 to an audience that included Church, Kleene, and Rosser. By this time, G\u00f6del had grasped that the key property his theorems required is that the system must be effective (at the time, the term \"general recursive\" was used). Rosser proved in 1936 that the hypothesis of \u03c9-consistency, which was an integral part of G\u00f6del's original proof, could be replaced by simple consistency, if the G\u00f6del sentence was changed in an appropriate way. These developments left the incompleteness theorems in essentially their modern form.\n\nGentzen published his consistency proof for first-order arithmetic in 1936. Hilbert accepted this proof as \"finitary\" although (as G\u00f6del's theorem had already shown) it cannot be formalized within the system of arithmetic that is being proved consistent.\n\nThe impact of the incompleteness theorems on Hilbert's program was quickly realized. Bernays included a full proof of the incompleteness theorems in the second volume of Grundlagen der Mathematik (1939), along with additional results of Ackermann on the \u03b5-substitution method and Gentzen's consistency proof of arithmetic. This was the first full published proof of the second incompleteness theorem.\n\n Criticisms \n\n Finsler \n\nPaul Finsler (1926) used a version of Richard's paradox to construct an expression that was false but unprovable in a particular, informal framework he had developed. G\u00f6del was unaware of this paper when he proved the incompleteness theorems (Collected Works Vol. IV., p.\u00a09). Finsler wrote to G\u00f6del in 1931 to inform him about this paper, which Finsler felt had priority for an incompleteness theorem. Finsler's methods did not rely on formalized provability, and had only a superficial resemblance to G\u00f6del's work (van Heijenoort 1967:328). G\u00f6del read the paper but found it deeply flawed, and his response to Finsler laid out concerns about the lack of formalization (Dawson:89). Finsler continued to argue for his philosophy of mathematics, which eschewed formalization, for the remainder of his career.\n\n Zermelo \n\nIn September 1931, Ernst Zermelo wrote to G\u00f6del to announce what he described as an \"essential gap\" in G\u00f6del's argument (Dawson:76). In October, G\u00f6del replied with a 10-page letter (Dawson:76, Grattan-Guinness:512-513), where he pointed out that Zermelo mistakenly assumed that the notion of truth in a system is definable in that system (which is not true in general by Tarski's undefinability theorem). But Zermelo did not relent and published his criticisms in print with \"a rather scathing paragraph on his young competitor\" (Grattan-Guinness:513). G\u00f6del decided that to pursue the matter further was pointless, and Carnap agreed (Dawson:77). Much of Zermelo's subsequent work was related to logics stronger than first-order logic, with which he hoped to show both the consistency and categoricity of mathematical theories.\n\n Wittgenstein \n\nLudwig Wittgenstein wrote several passages about the incompleteness theorems that were published posthumously in his 1953 Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, in particular one section sometimes called the \"notorious paragraph\" where he seems to confuse the notions of \"true\" and \"provable\" in Russell's system. G\u00f6del was a member of the Vienna Circle during the period in which Wittgenstein's early ideal language philosophy and Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus dominated the circle's thinking.  There has been some controversy about whether Wittgenstein misunderstood the incompleteness theorem or just expressed himself unclearly. Writings in G\u00f6del's Nachlass express the belief that Wittgenstein misread his ideas.\n\nMultiple commentators have read Wittgenstein as misunderstanding G\u00f6del (Rodych 2003), although Juliet Floyd and Hilary Putnam (2000), as well as Graham Priest (2004) have provided textual readings arguing that most commentary misunderstands Wittgenstein. On their release, Bernays, Dummett, and Kreisel wrote separate reviews on Wittgenstein's remarks, all of which were extremely negative (Berto 2009:208). The unanimity of this criticism caused Wittgenstein's remarks on the incompleteness theorems to have little impact on the logic community. In 1972, G\u00f6del stated: \"Has Wittgenstein lost his mind? Does he mean it seriously? He intentionally utters trivially nonsensical statements\" (Wang 1996:179), and wrote to Karl Menger  that Wittgenstein's comments demonstrate a misunderstanding of the incompleteness theorems writing:\n\nSince the publication of Wittgenstein's Nachlass in 2000, a series of papers in philosophy have sought to evaluate whether the original criticism of Wittgenstein's remarks was justified. Floyd and Putnam (2000) argue that Wittgenstein had a more complete understanding of the incompleteness theorem than was previously assumed. They are particularly concerned with the interpretation of a G\u00f6del sentence for an \u03c9-inconsistent system as actually saying \"I am not provable\", since the system has no models in which the provability predicate corresponds to actual provability. Rodych (2003) argues that their interpretation of Wittgenstein is not historically justified, while Bays (2004) argues against Floyd and Putnam's philosophical analysis of the provability predicate. Berto (2009) explores the relationship between Wittgenstein's writing and theories of paraconsistent logic.\n\n See also \n\n G\u00f6del machine\n G\u00f6del's completeness theorem\n G\u00f6del's speed-up theorem\n G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\n L\u00f6b's Theorem\n Minds, Machines and G\u00f6del\n M\u00fcnchhausen trilemma\n Non-standard model of arithmetic\n Proof theory\n Provability logic\n Quining\n Tarski's undefinability theorem\n Theory of everything#G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem\n Third Man Argument\n\n References \n Citations \n\n Articles by G\u00f6del \n Kurt G\u00f6del, 1931, \"\u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I\", Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik, v. 38 n. 1, pp.\u00a0173\u2013198.\n \u2014, 1931, \"\u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I\", in Solomon Feferman, ed., 1986.

Three translations exist. Of the first John Dawson states that: \"The Meltzer translation was seriously deficient and received a devastating review in the Journal of Symbolic Logic; \"G\u00f6del also complained about Braithwaite's commentary (Dawson 1997:216). \"Fortunately, the Meltzer translation was soon supplanted by a better one prepared by Elliott Mendelson for Martin Davis's anthology The Undecidable . . . he found the translation \"not quite so good\" as he had expected . . . [but because of time constraints he] agreed to its publication\" (ibid). (In a footnote Dawson states that \"he would regret his compliance, for the published volume was marred throughout by sloppy typography and numerous misprints\" (ibid)). Dawson states that \"The translation that G\u00f6del favored was that by Jean van Heijenoort\" (ibid). For the serious student another version exists as a set of lecture notes recorded by Stephen Kleene and J. B. Rosser \"during lectures given by G\u00f6del at to the Institute for Advanced Study during the spring of 1934\" (cf commentary by Davis 1965:39 and beginning on p.\u00a041); this version is titled \"On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems\".

For example, the statement:\n\"This statement cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic in fewer than a googolplex symbols\"\nis provable in Peano arithmetic (PA) but the shortest proof has at least a googolplex symbols, by an  argument similar to the proof of G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem: If PA is consistent, then it cannot prove the statement in fewer than a googolplex symbols, because the existence of such a proof would itself be a theorem of PA, a contradiction.

{"title": "Hilbert's program", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program", "text": "In mathematics, Hilbert's program, formulated by German mathematician David Hilbert in the early part of the 20th century, was a proposed solution to the foundational crisis of mathematics, when early attempts to clarify the foundations of mathematics were found to suffer from paradoxes and inconsistencies. As a solution, Hilbert proposed to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of axioms, and provide a proof that these axioms were consistent. Hilbert proposed that the consistency of more complicated systems, such as real analysis, could be proven in terms of simpler systems. Ultimately, the consistency of all of mathematics could be reduced to basic arithmetic.\n\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, published in 1931, showed that Hilbert's program was unattainable for key areas of mathematics. In his first theorem, G\u00f6del showed that any consistent system with a computable set of axioms which is capable of expressing arithmetic can never be complete: it is possible to construct a statement that can be shown to be true, but that cannot be derived from the formal rules of the system. In his second theorem, he showed that such a system could not prove its own consistency, so it certainly cannot be used to prove the consistency of anything stronger with certainty. This refuted Hilbert's assumption that a finitistic system could be used to prove the consistency of itself, and therefore anything else.\n\nStatement of Hilbert's program\nThe main goal of Hilbert's program was to provide secure foundations for all mathematics. In particular this should include:\nA formulation of all mathematics; in other words all mathematical statements should be written in a precise formal language, and manipulated according to well defined rules.\nCompleteness: a proof that all true mathematical statements can be proved in the formalism.\nConsistency: a proof that no contradiction can be obtained in the formalism of mathematics. This consistency proof should preferably use only \"finitistic\" reasoning about finite mathematical objects.\nConservation: a proof that any result about \"real objects\" obtained using reasoning about \"ideal objects\" (such as uncountable sets) can be proved without using ideal objects.\nDecidability: there should be an algorithm for deciding the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement.\n\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems\n\nKurt G\u00f6del showed that most of the goals of Hilbert's program were impossible to achieve, at least if interpreted in the most obvious way. G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem shows that any consistent theory powerful enough to encode addition and multiplication of integers cannot prove its own consistency. This presents a challenge to Hilbert's program:\n\nIt is not possible to formalize all mathematical true statements within a formal system, as any attempt at such a formalism will omit some true mathematical statements. There is no complete, consistent extension of even Peano arithmetic based on a recursively enumerable set of axioms.\nA theory such as Peano arithmetic cannot even prove its own consistency, so a restricted \"finitistic\" subset of it certainly cannot prove the consistency of more powerful theories such as set theory.\nThere is no algorithm to decide the truth (or provability) of statements in any consistent extension of Peano arithmetic. Strictly speaking, this negative solution to the Entscheidungsproblem appeared a few years after G\u00f6del's theorem, because at the time the notion of an algorithm had not been precisely defined.\n\nHilbert's program after G\u00f6del\nMany current lines of research in mathematical logic, such as proof theory and reverse mathematics, can be viewed as natural continuations of Hilbert's original program.  Much of it can be salvaged by changing its goals slightly (Zach 2005), and with the following modifications some of it was successfully completed:\nAlthough it is not possible to formalize all mathematics, it is possible to formalize essentially all the mathematics that anyone uses. In particular Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, combined with first-order logic, gives a satisfactory and generally accepted formalism for almost all current mathematics.\nAlthough it is not possible to prove completeness for systems at least as powerful as Peano arithmetic (at least if they have a computable set of axioms), it is possible to prove forms of completeness for many other interesting systems. The first big success was by G\u00f6del himself (before he proved the incompleteness theorems) who proved the completeness theorem for first-order logic, showing that any logical consequence of a series of axioms is provable. An example of a non-trivial theory for which completeness has been proved is the theory of algebraically closed fields of given characteristic.\nThe question of whether there are finitary consistency proofs of strong theories is difficult to answer, mainly because there is no generally accepted definition of a \"finitary proof\". Most mathematicians in proof theory seem to regard finitary mathematics as being contained in Peano arithmetic, and in this case it is not possible to give finitary proofs of reasonably strong theories. On the other hand, G\u00f6del himself suggested the possibility of giving finitary consistency proofs using finitary methods that cannot be formalized in Peano arithmetic, so he seems to have had a more liberal view of what finitary methods might be allowed. A few years later, Gentzen gave a consistency proof for Peano arithmetic. The only part of this proof that was not clearly finitary was a certain transfinite induction up to the ordinal \u03b50. If this transfinite induction is accepted as a finitary method, then one can assert that there is a finitary proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic. More powerful subsets of second order arithmetic have been given consistency proofs by Gaisi Takeuti and others, and one can again debate about exactly how finitary or constructive these proofs are. (The theories that have been proved consistent by these methods are quite strong, and include most \"ordinary\" mathematics.)\nAlthough there is no algorithm for deciding the truth of statements in Peano arithmetic, there are many interesting and non-trivial theories for which such algorithms have been found. For example, Tarski found an algorithm that can decide the truth of any statement in analytic geometry (more precisely, he proved that the theory of real closed fields is decidable). Given the Cantor\u2013Dedekind axiom, this algorithm can be regarded as an algorithm to decide the truth of any statement in Euclidean geometry. This is substantial as few people would consider Euclidean geometry a trivial theory.\n\nSee also\n\nGrundlagen der Mathematik\nFoundational crisis of mathematics\nAtomism\n\nReferences\nG.

{"title": "Hilbert's second problem", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_second_problem", "text": "In mathematics, Hilbert's second problem was posed by David Hilbert in 1900 as one of his 23 problems.  It asks for a proof that the arithmetic is consistent \u2013 free of any internal contradictions. Hilbert  stated that the axioms he considered for arithmetic were the ones given in , which include a second order completeness axiom.\n\nIn the 1930s, Kurt G\u00f6del and Gerhard Gentzen proved results that cast new light on the problem.  Some feel that G\u00f6del's theorems give a negative solution to the problem, while others consider Gentzen's proof as a partial positive solution.\n\n Hilbert's problem and its interpretation \n\nIn one English translation, Hilbert asks:\n\"When we are engaged in investigating the foundations of a science, we must set up a system of axioms which contains an exact and complete description of the relations subsisting between the elementary ideas of that science. ...  But above all I wish to designate the following as the most important among the numerous questions which can be asked with regard to the axioms: To prove that they are not contradictory, that is, that a definite number of logical steps based upon them can never lead to contradictory results. In geometry, the proof of the compatibility of the axioms can be effected by constructing a suitable field of numbers, such that analogous relations between the numbers of this field correspond to the geometrical axioms. ... On the other hand a direct method is needed for the proof of the compatibility of the arithmetical axioms.\"From the English translation by M. Newson, 1902 provided by http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/problems.html .  \n\nHilbert's statement is sometimes misunderstood, because by the \"arithmetical axioms\" he did not mean a system equivalent to Peano arithmetic, but a stronger system with a second-order completeness axiom. The system Hilbert asked for a completeness proof of is more like second-order arithmetic than first-order Peano arithmetic.\n\nAs a nowadays common interpretation, a positive solution to Hilbert's second question would in particular provide a proof that Peano arithmetic is consistent.\n\nThere are many known proofs that Peano arithmetic is consistent that can be carried out in strong systems such as Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.  These do not provide a resolution to Hilbert's second question, however, because someone who doubts the consistency of Peano arithmetic is unlikely to accept the axioms of set theory (which is much stronger) to prove its consistency.  Thus a satisfactory answer to Hilbert's problem must be carried out using principles that would be acceptable to someone who does not already believe PA is consistent.  Such principles are often called finitistic because they are completely constructive and do not presuppose a completed infinity of natural numbers.  G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem (see G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems) places a severe limit on how weak a finitistic system can be while still proving the consistency of Peano arithmetic.\n\n G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem \n\nG\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem shows that it is not possible for any proof that Peano Arithmetic is consistent to be carried out within Peano arithmetic itself.  This theorem shows that if the only acceptable proof procedures are those that can be formalized within arithmetic then Hilbert's call for a consistency proof cannot be answered.  However, as Nagel and Newman (1958:96\u201399) explain, there is still room for a proof that cannot be formalized in arithmetic:\n\n\"This imposing result of Godel's analysis should not be misunderstood: it does not exclude a meta-mathematical proof of the consistency of arithmetic. What it excludes is a proof of consistency that can be mirrored by the formal deductions of arithmetic. Meta-mathematical proofs of the consistency of arithmetic have, in fact, been constructed, notably by Gerhard Gentzen, a member of the Hilbert school, in 1936, and by others since then. ...  But these meta-mathematical proofs cannot be represented within the arithmetical calculus; and, since they are not finitistic, they do not achieve the proclaimed objectives of Hilbert's original program. ... The possibility of constructing a finitistic absolute proof of consistency for arithmetic is not excluded by G\u00f6del\u2019s results. G\u00f6del showed that no such proof is possible that can be represented within arithmetic. His argument does not eliminate the possibility of strictly finitistic proofs that cannot be represented within arithmetic. But no one today appears to have a clear idea of what a finitistic proof would be like that is not capable of formulation within arithmetic.\"A similar quotation with minor variations in wording appears in the 2001 edition p.107-108, as revised by Douglas R. Hofstadter, New York University Press, NY, .\n\n Gentzen's consistency proof \n\nIn 1936, Gentzen published a proof that Peano Arithmetic is consistent. Gentzen's result shows that a consistency proof can be obtained in a system that is much weaker than set theory.\n\nGentzen's proof proceeds by assigning to each proof in Peano arithmetic an ordinal number, based on the structure of the proof, with each of these ordinals less than \u03b50.Actually, the proof assigns a \"notation\" for an ordinal number to each proof.  The notation is a finite string of symbols that intuitively stands for an ordinal number.  By representing the ordinal in a finite way, Gentzen's proof does not presuppose strong axioms regarding ordinal numbers. He then proves by transfinite induction on these ordinals that no proof can conclude in a contradiction.  The method used in this proof can also be used to prove a cut elimination result for Peano arithmetic in a stronger logic than first-order logic, but the consistency proof itself can be carried out in ordinary first-order logic using the axioms of primitive recursive arithmetic and a transfinite induction principle.  Tait (2005) gives a game-theoretic interpretation of Gentzen's method.\n\nGentzen's consistency proof initiated the program of ordinal analysis in proof theory.  In this program, formal theories of arithmetic or set theory are assigned ordinal numbers that measure the consistency strength of the theories. A theory will be unable to prove the consistency of another theory with a higher proof theoretic ordinal.\n\n Modern viewpoints on the status of the problem \n\nWhile the theorems of G\u00f6del and Gentzen are now well understood by the mathematical logic community, no consensus has formed on whether (or in what way) these theorems answer Hilbert's second problem.  Simpson (1988:sec. 3) argues that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem shows that it is not possible to produce finitistic consistency proofs of strong theories.  Kreisel (1976) states that although G\u00f6del's results imply that no finitistic syntactic consistency proof can be obtained, semantic (in particular, second-order) arguments can be used to give convincing consistency proofs. Detlefsen (1990:p.\u00a065) argues that G\u00f6del's theorem does not prevent a consistency proof because its hypotheses might not apply to all the systems in which a consistency proof could be carried out. Dawson (2006:sec. 2) calls the belief that G\u00f6del's theorem eliminates the possibility of a persuasive consistency proof \"erroneous\", citing the consistency proof given by Gentzen and a later one given by G\u00f6del in 1958.\n\nSee also\n Takeuti conjecture\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Dawson, John W.

{"title": "Hilbert curve", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve", "text": "right|thumb|First six iterations of the Hilbert curve\nA Hilbert curve (also known as a Hilbert space-filling curve) is a continuous fractal space-filling curve first described by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1891,D. Hilbert: \u00dcber die stetige Abbildung einer Linie auf ein Fl\u00e4chenst\u00fcck. Mathematische Annalen 38 (1891), 459\u2013460. as a variant of the space-filling Peano curves discovered by Giuseppe Peano in 1890.G.Peano: Sur une courbe, qui remplit toute une aire plane. Mathematische Annalen 36 (1890), 157\u2013160.\n\nBecause it is space-filling, its Hausdorff dimension is  (precisely, its image is the unit square, whose dimension is 2 in any definition of dimension; its graph is a compact set homeomorphic to the closed unit interval, with Hausdorff dimension 2).\n\n is the th approximation to the limiting curve.  The Euclidean length of  is , i.e., it grows exponentially with , while at the same time always being bounded by a square with a finite area.\n\nImages\n\nApplications and mapping algorithms\n\nBoth the true Hilbert curve and its discrete approximations are useful because they give a mapping between 1D and 2D space that preserves locality fairly well..  This means that two data points which are close to each other in one-dimensional space are also close to each other after folding. The converse can't always be true.\n\nBecause of this locality property,  the Hilbert curve is widely used in computer science.  For example, the range of IP addresses used by computers can be mapped into a picture using the Hilbert curve.  Code to generate the image would map from 2D to 1D to find the color of each pixel, and the Hilbert curve is sometimes used because it keeps nearby IP addresses close to each other in the picture.\n\nA grayscale photograph can be converted to a dithered black-and-white image using thresholding, with the leftover amount from each pixel added to the next pixel along the Hilbert curve.  Code to do this would map from 1D to 2D, and the Hilbert curve is sometimes used because it does not create the distracting patterns that would be visible to the eye if the order were simply left to right across each row of pixels.  Hilbert curves in higher dimensions are an instance of a generalization of Gray codes, and are sometimes used for similar purposes, for similar reasons.  For multidimensional databases, Hilbert order has been proposed to be used instead of Z order because it has better locality-preserving behavior. For example, Hilbert curves have been used to compress and accelerate R-tree indexesI. Kamel, C. Faloutsos, Hilbert R-tree: An improved R-tree using fractals, in: Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA, 1994, pp. 500\u2013509. (see Hilbert R-tree). They have also been used to help compress data warehouses.\n\nGiven the variety of applications, it is useful to have algorithms to map in both directions.  In many languages, these are better if implemented with iteration rather than recursion.  The following C code performs the mappings in both directions, using iteration and bit operations rather than recursion.  It assumes a square divided into n by n cells, for n a power of 2, with integer coordinates, with (0,0) in the lower left corner, (n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01,\u00a0n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) in the upper right corner, and a distance d that starts at 0 in the lower left corner and goes to  in the lower-right corner. This is different from the animation shown above where the curve starts from upper left corner and terminates at upper right corner.\n\n//convert (x,y) to d\nint xy2d (int n, int x, int y) {\n    int rx, ry, s, d=0;\n    for (s=n/2; s>0; s/=2) {\n        rx = (x & s) > 0;\n        ry = (y & s) > 0;\n        d += s * s * ((3 * rx) ^ ry);\n        rot(n, &x, &y, rx, ry);\n    }\n    return d;\n}\n\n//convert d to (x,y)\nvoid d2xy(int n, int d, int *x, int *y) {\n    int rx, ry, s, t=d;\n    *x = *y = 0;\n    for (s=1; s<n; s*=2) {\n        rx = 1 & (t/2);\n        ry = 1 & (t ^ rx);\n        rot(s, x, y, rx, ry);\n        *x += s * rx;\n        *y += s * ry;\n        t /= 4;\n    }\n}\n\n//rotate/flip a quadrant appropriately\nvoid rot(int n, int *x, int *y, int rx, int ry) {\n    if (ry == 0) {\n        if (rx == 1) {\n            *x = n-1 - *x;\n            *y = n-1 - *y;\n        }\n\n        //Swap x and y\n        int t  = *x;\n        *x = *y;\n        *y = t;\n    }\n}\n\nThese use the C conventions: the & symbol is a bitwise AND, the ^ symbol is a bitwise XOR, the += operator adds on to a variable, and the /= operator divides a variable.  The handling of booleans in C means that in xy2d, the variable rx is set to 0 or 1 to match bit s of x, and similarly for ry.\n\nThe xy2d function works top down, starting with the most significant bits of x and y, and building up the most significant bits of d first.  The d2xy function works in the opposite order, starting with the least significant bits of d, and building up x and y starting with the least significant bits.  Both functions use the rotation function to rotate and flip the (x,y) coordinate system appropriately.\n\nThe two mapping algorithms work in similar ways.  The entire square is viewed as composed of 4 regions, arranged 2 by 2.  Each region is composed of 4 smaller regions, and so on, for a number of levels.  At level s, each region is s by s cells.  There is a single FOR loop that iterates through levels.  On each iteration, an amount is added to d or to x and y, determined by which of the 4 regions it is in at the current level.  The current region out of the 4 is (rx,ry), where rx and ry are each 0 or 1.  So it consumes 2 input bits, (either 2 from d or 1 each from x and y), and generates two output bits.  It also calls the rotation function so that (x,y) will be appropriate for the next level, on the next iteration.  For xy2d, it starts at the top level of the entire square, and works its way down to the lowest level of individual cells.  For d2xy, it starts at the bottom with cells, and works up to include the entire square.\n\nIt is possible to implement Hilbert curves efficiently even when the data space does not form a square. Moreover, there are several possible generalizations of Hilbert curves to higher dimensions.H. J.

{"title": "Integer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer", "text": "An integer (from the Latin integer meaning \"whole\") is a number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, 0, and\u00a0\u22122048 are integers, while 9.75, , and\u00a0 are not.\n\nThe set of integers consists of zero (), the positive natural numbers (, , ,\u00a0\u2026), also called whole numbers or counting numbers, and their additive inverses (the negative integers, i.e., \u22121, \u22122, \u22123,\u00a0\u2026). The set of integers is often denoted by a boldface Z (\"\") or blackboard bold  (Unicode U+2124 \u2124) standing for the German word Zahlen (, \"numbers\"). \n\n is a subset of the set of all rational numbers , in turn a subset of the real numbers .  Like the natural numbers,  is countably infinite.\n\nThe integers form the smallest group and the smallest ring containing the natural numbers. In algebraic number theory, the integers are sometimes qualified as rational integers to distinguish them from the more general algebraic integers. In fact, the (rational) integers are the algebraic integers that are also rational numbers.\n\nSymbol\n\nThe symbol  can be annotated to denote various sets, with varying usage amongst different authors: ,  or  for the positive integers,  for non-negative integers,  for non-zero integers. Some authors use  for non-zero integers, others use it for non-negative integers, or for . Additionally,  is used to denote either the set of integers modulo , i.e., a set of congruence classes of integers, or the set of -adic integers.Keith Pledger and Dave Wilkins, \"Edexcel AS and A Level Modular Mathematics: Core Mathematics 1\" Pearson 2008LK Turner, FJ BUdden, D Knighton, \"Advanced Mathematics\", Book 2, Longman 1975.\n\n Algebraic properties \nright|thumb|300px|Integers can be thought of as discrete, equally spaced points on an infinitely long number line. In the above, non-negative integers are shown in purple and negative integers in red.\n\nLike the natural numbers,  is closed under the operations of addition and multiplication, that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer. However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers, and, importantly,\u00a0,  (unlike the natural numbers) is also closed under subtraction. The integers form a unital ring which is the most basic one, in the following sense: for any unital ring, there is a unique ring homomorphism from the integers into this ring. This universal property, namely to be an initial object in the category of rings, characterizes the ring\u00a0.\n\n is not closed under division, since the quotient of two integers (e.g.,\u00a01 divided by\u00a02), need not be an integer. Although the natural numbers are closed under exponentiation, the integers are not (since the result can be a fraction when the exponent is negative).\n\nThe following table lists some of the basic properties of addition and multiplication for any integers ,  and .\n+Properties of addition and multiplication on integersAdditionMultiplicationClosure:is an integeris an integerAssociativity:Commutativity:Existence of an identity element:Existence of inverse elements:The only invertible integers (called units) are  and\u00a0.Distributivity:andNo zero divisors:  If , then  or  (or both)\n\nIn the language of abstract algebra, the first five properties listed above for addition say that  under addition is an abelian group. It is also a cyclic group, since every non-zero integer can be written as a finite sum  or . In fact,  under addition is the only infinite cyclic group, in the sense that any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to .\n\nThe first four properties listed above for multiplication say that  under multiplication is a commutative monoid. However, not every integer has a multiplicative inverse; e.g., there is no integer  such that . This means that  under multiplication is not a group.\n\nAll the rules from the above property table, except for the last, taken together say that  together with addition and multiplication is a commutative ring with unity. It is the prototype of all objects of such algebraic structure. Only those equalities of expressions are true in\u00a0 for all values of variables, which are true in any unital commutative ring. Note that certain non-zero integers map to zero in certain rings.\n\nThe lack of zero divisors in the integers (last property in the table) means that the commutative ring\u00a0 is an integral domain.\n\nThe lack of multiplicative inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that  is not closed under division, means that  is not a field. The smallest field containing the integers as a subring is the field of rational numbers. The process of constructing the rationals from the integers can be mimicked to form the field of fractions of any integral domain. And back, starting from an algebraic number field (an extension of rational numbers), its ring of integers can be extracted, which includes  as its subring.\n\nAlthough ordinary division is not defined on , the division \"with remainder\" is defined on them. It is called Euclidean division and possesses the following important property: that is, given two integers  and  with , there exist unique integers  and  such that  and , where  denotes the absolute value of . The integer  is called the quotient and  is called the remainder of the division of  by . The Euclidean algorithm for computing greatest common divisors works by a sequence of Euclidean divisions.\n\nAgain, in the language of abstract algebra, the above says that Z is a Euclidean domain. This implies that  is a principal ideal domain and any positive integer can be written as the products of primes in an essentially unique way. This is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.\n\nOrder-theoretic properties\n is a totally ordered set without upper or lower bound. The ordering of  is given by:\n\nAn integer is positive if it is greater than zero and negative if it is less than zero. Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive.\n\nThe ordering of integers is compatible with the algebraic operations in the following way:\n if  and , then \n if  and , then .\n\nIt follows that  together with the above ordering is an ordered ring.\n\nThe integers are the only nontrivial totally ordered abelian group whose positive elements are well-ordered.. This is equivalent to the statement that any Noetherian valuation ring is either a field or a discrete valuation ring.\n\nConstruction\nthumb|alt=Representation of equivalence classes for the numbers \u22125 to 5\n|Red points represent ordered pairs of natural numbers. Linked red points are equivalence classes representing the blue integers at the end of the line.|upright=1.5\nIn elementary school teaching, integers are often intuitively defined as the (positive) natural numbers,  zero, and the negations of the natural numbers. However, this style of definition leads to many different cases (each arithmetic operation needs to be defined on each combination of types of integer) and makes it tedious to prove that these operations obey the laws of arithmetic.. Therefore, in modern set-theoretic mathematics a more abstract construction,Ivorra Castillo: \u00c1lgebra which allows one to define the arithmetical operations without any case distinction, is often used instead.. The integers can thus be formally constructed as the equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers .\n\nThe intuition is that  stands for the result of subtracting  from . To confirm our expectation that  and  denote the same number, we define an equivalence relation  on these pairs with the following rule:\n\nprecisely when\n\nAddition and multiplication of integers can be defined in terms of the equivalent operations on the natural numbers; denoting by  the equivalence class having  as a member, one has:\n\nThe negation (or additive inverse) of an integer is obtained by reversing the order of the pair:\n\nHence subtraction can be defined as the addition of the additive inverse:\n\nThe standard ordering on the integers is given by:\n iff \n\nIt is easily verified that these definitions are independent of the choice of representatives of the equivalence classes.\n\nEvery equivalence class has a unique member that is of the form  or  (or both at once). The natural number  is identified with the class  (in other words the natural numbers are embedded into the integers by map sending  to ), and the class  is denoted  (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class  a second time since \n\nThus,  is denoted by\n\nIf the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers (using the embedding mentioned above), this convention creates no ambiguity.\n\nThis notation recovers the familiar representation of the integers as  }.\n\nSome examples are:\n\nIn theoretical computer science, other approaches for the construction of integers are used by automated theorem provers and term rewrite engines.\nIntegers are represented as algebraic terms built using a few basic operations  (such as zero, succ, pred, etc.) and, possibly, using natural numbers, which are assumed to be already constructed (e.g., using the Peano approach).\n\nThere exist at least ten such constructions of signed integers. These constructions differ in several ways: the number of basic operations used for the construction, the number (usually, between 0 and 2) and the types of arguments accepted by these operations; the presence or absence of natural numbers as arguments of some of these operations, and the fact that these operations are free constructors or not, i.e., that the same integer can be represented using only one or many algebraic terms.\n\nThe technique for the construction of integers presented above in this section corresponds to the particular case where there is a single basic operation pair that takes as arguments two natural numbers  and , and returns an integer (equal to ). This operation is not free since the integer 0 can be written pair(0,0), or pair(1,1), or pair(2,2), etc. This technique of construction is used by the proof assistant Isabelle; however, many other tools use alternative construction techniques, notable those based upon free constructors, which are simpler and can be implemented more efficiently in computers.\n\nComputer science\n\nAn integer is often a primitive data type in computer languages. However, integer data types can only represent a subset of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. Also, in the common two's complement representation, the inherent definition of sign distinguishes between \"negative\" and \"non-negative\" rather than \"negative, positive, and\u00a00\". (It is, however, certainly possible for a computer to determine whether an integer value is truly positive.) Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted int or Integer in several programming languages (such as Algol68, C, Java, Delphi, etc.).\n\nVariable-length representations of integers, such as bignums, can store any integer that fits in the computer's memory. Other integer data types are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of\u00a02 (4, 8, 16, etc.) or a memorable number of decimal digits (e.g., 9 or\u00a010).\n\nCardinality\nThe cardinality of the set of integers is equal to  (aleph-null).

{"title": "Latino sine flexione", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione", "text": "Latino sine flexione (\"Latin without inflections\"), Interlingua de Academia pro Interlingua (IL de ApI) or Peano\u2019s Interlingua (abbreviated as IL), is an international auxiliary language compiled by the Academia pro Interlingua under chairmanship of the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858\u20131932) in 1887-1914. It is a simplified version of Latin, and retains its vocabulary. Language codes ISO 639: ISO 639-2 and -1 were requested on 23 July 2017 at Library of Congress (proposed: IL and ILA); ISO-639-3 was requested on 10 August 2017 at SIL (proposed: ILA). Interlingua-IL was published in the journal Revue de Math\u00e9matiques (meaning Mathematical Review), in an article of 1903 entitled De Latino Sine Flexione, Lingua Auxiliare Internationale (meaning Latin Without Inflection, International Auxiliary Language),Peano, Giuseppe (1903). De Latino Sine Flexione. Lingua Auxiliare Internationale , Revista de Mathematica (Revue de Math\u00e9matiques), Tomo VIII, pp. 74-83. Fratres Bocca Editores: Torino. which explained the reason for its creation. The article argued that other auxiliary languages were unnecessary, since Latin was already established as the world\u2019s international language. The article was written in classical Latin, but it gradually dropped its inflections until there were none.\n\nHistory\nIn 1903 Peano published the article De Latino Sine Flexione to introduce his language, by quoting a series of suggestions by Leibniz about a simplified form of Latin.Couturat, Louis (1901). La Logique de Leibniz. Paris.Couturat, Louis (1903). Opuscules et fragments in\u00e9dits de Leibniz. Paris. Peano\u2019s article appeared to be a serious development of the idea, so he gained a reputation among the movement for the auxiliary language.\nIn 1904 Peano undertook an essay about the way to obtain the minimal grammar of an eventual minimal Latin (Latino minimo), with a minimal vocabulary purely international.Peano, Giuseppe (1904). Vocabulario de Latino internationale comparato cum Anglo, Franco, Germano, Hispano, Italo, Russo, Gr\u00e6co et Sanscrito . Torino.\n\nPeano and some colleagues published articles in Latino sine flexione for several years at the Revue de Math\u00e9matiques.  Because of his desire to prove that this was indeed an international language, Peano boldly published the final edition of his famous Formulario mathematico in Latino sine flexione. However, as Hubert Kennedy notes, most mathematicians were put off by the artificial appearance of the language, and made no attempt to read it.Kennedy, Hubert (2006). Peano. Life and Works of Giuseppe Peano. Concord, CA: Peremptory Publications: p. 169 (a), p. 185 (b).\n\nIn October 1907, Peano was at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris to take part in the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language. Having declared for Latino sine flexione to be adopted, he eventually could not participate in the final voting, because of labour affairs at Turin.Academia pro Interlingua (Nov. 1909). D\u00e9l\u00e9gation pour l\u2019Adoption d\u2019une Langue Auxiliaire Internationale . Discussiones (2): p. 37-9.\n\nOn 26 December 1908, Peano was elected member and director of the Akademi internasional de lingu universal still using Idiom Neutral, which was refounded one year later under the name Academia pro Interlingua. Every academician might use their favourite form of Interlingua, the term being initially used in a general sense as a synonym for international language, yet it soon began to be specially used to denote a reformed Latino sine flexione based on the common rules the academicians were reaching by frequent votings. Thus, the name Interlingua soon began to denote the language evolving from the Academia Pro Interlingua, with the corresponding abbreviation IL.\n\nHowever, every member was free to write in their own personal style, and indeed some members were proposing radical reforms which eventually might end up as independent languages (like Michaux's Romanal or De Wahl's Interlingue). For this reason, the name Peano\u2019s Interlingua or Interlingua (IL) might be regarded as the most accurate for the particular standard by Peano. (As found in \u201cInterglossa and its predecessors\u201d.Hogben, Lancelot (1943). Interglossa. A draft of an auxiliary for a democratic world order, being an attempt to apply semantic principles to language design.  Harmondsworth, Middlesex, Eng. / New York:  Penguin Books: p. 10-11. OCLC 1265553.)\n\nThe discussions to reach a standard Interlingua may be seen on the pages of Discussiones, the official journal of the Academia pro Interlingua from 1909 to 1913. This and subsequent journals of the academy have been recently published in a CD-Rom by the mathematics department of the university of Turin,Silvia Roero, Clara (coord.) (2003). Le Riviste di Giuseppe Peano  (CD-Rom N. 4). Dipartimento di Matematica dell\u2019 Universit\u00e0 di Torino. the place where Peano developed his teaching and research.\n\nSince De Latino Sine Flexione had set the principle to take Latin nouns either in the ablative or nominative form (nomen was preferred to nomine), in 1909 Peano published a vocabulary in order to assist in selecting the proper form of every noun,Peano, Giuseppe (1909). Vocabulario Commune ad linguas de Europa . Cavoretto - Torino. yet an essential value of Peano\u2019s Interlingua was that the lexicon might be found straightforward in any Latin dictionary (by getting the thematic vowel of the stem from the genitive ending, that is: -a -o -e -u -e from -ae -i -is -us -ei).\nFinally, a large vocabulary with 14 000 words was published in 1915.Peano, Giuseppe (1915). Vocabulario Commune ad Latino-Italiano-Fran\u00e7ais-English-Deutsch pro usu de interlinguistas . Cavoretto - Torino.\n\nA reformed Interlingua was presented in 1951 by Alexander Gode as the last director of the International Auxiliary Language Association. It was claimed to be independent from Peano\u2019s Interlingua, because it had developed a new method to detect the most recent common prototypes. But that method usually leads to the Latin ablative, so most vocabulary of Peano\u2019s Interlingua would be kept. Accordingly, the very name Interlingua was kept, yet a distinct abbreviation was adopted: IA instead of IL.\n\nAlphabet and pronunciation\n+ Interlingua (de ApI) alphabet Number 1234568891011121314151617181920212223242526 Upper case  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ Lower case abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz IPA phonemesks\n\nAccording to Peano's guide to the language in 1931, \"most Interlinguists are in favour of the old Latin pronunciation.\" This gives the pronunciation of vowels as follows:\n a\u2014as in father \u2013 \n e\u2014as in they \u2013 \n i\u2014as in feet \u2013 \n o\u2014as in tone \u2013 \n u\u2014as in rule \u2013 \n y\u2014as French u \u2013 \n j\u2014as in yes \u2013 \n ae\u2014as in eye \u2013 \n oe\u2014as in boy \u2013 \n\nConsonants are pronounced as in English with the following exceptions:\n b\u2014like English b, but like p if followed by s or t \u2013 \n g\u2014like g in go, get \u2013 \n h\u2014silent in th, ph, ch, rh, otherwise like English h \u2013 \n qu\u2014as qu in quarrel \u2013 \n r\u2014as in corr (trilled) \u2013 \n v\u2014like English w. \u2013 \n x\u2014as ks. \u2013 \n ch, ph, th\u2014as c, p, t in can, pan, tan \u2013 \n c\u2014like k always, as in scan, scat \u2013  (not aspirated)\n p\u2014as in span\n t\u2014as in stand\n\nThe following simplifications to pronunciation are also allowed:\n y and j\u2014as i in tin \u2013 \n ae and oe\u2014as  above\n b\u2014always like English b \u2013 \n h\u2014silent\n ph\u2014as p or f \u2013 \n v\u2014like English v \u2013 \n th\u2014as t\n ch\u2014as c\n\nThe stress is based on the classical Latin rule:\n Words with two syllables have the stress on the penult.\n Words with three or more syllables have the stress on the penult only if it has a long vowel, otherwise on the antepenult  (p. xii).\nA secondary accent may be placed when necessary as the speaker deems appropriate.\n\nParts of speech\nThough Peano removed the inflections of Latin from nouns and adjectives, he did not entirely remove grammatical gender, permitting the option of a feminine ending for occupations. The gender of animals is immutable. All forms of nouns end with a vowel and are taken from the ablative case, but as this was not listed in most Latin dictionaries, he gave the rule for its derivation from the genitive case. The plural is not required when not necessary, such as when a number has been specified, the plural can be read from the context, and so on; however Peano gives the option of using the suffix -s to indicate it when needed. Verbs have few inflections of conjugation; tenses and moods are instead indicated by verb adjuncts. The result is a change to a positional language.\n\nParticles\nParticles that have no inflection in classical Latin are used in their natural form:\n supra, infra, intra, extra\u2026 (but superiore, inferiore, interiore, exteriore from superior, -oris and so on.)\n super, subter, inter, praeter, semper\u2026 (but nostro, vestro, dextro\u2026 from noster, -tra, -trum and so on.)\n tres, quatuor, quinque, sex, septem, octo, novem, decem\u2026 (but uno from unus, -a, -um; duo from duo, -ae, -o; nullo from nullus, -a, -um; multo from multus, -a, -um, etc.)\n\nNouns\nThe form of nouns depends on the Latin declensions.\n\n Latin declension number (genitive ending) 1: -ae2: -i3: -is4: -us5: -ei Latino ending -a-o-e-u-e\n\nLatin declension/nominative form Latin genitive Latin ablative Latino English 1st: rosa rosaerosarosarose 2nd: laurus laurilaurolaurolaurel 3rd: pax pacispacepacepeace 4th: casus casuscasucasucase 5th: series serieiserieserieseries\n\nThose proper nouns written with the Roman alphabet are kept as close to the original as possible. The following are examples: M\u00fcnchen, New York, Roma, Giovanni.\n\nPronounsManuale Practico de Interlingua . Pronomines: p. 29.\n Personal\n\n Number Singular Plural 1st person me  nos 2nd person te vos 3rd person illo (male), illa (female), id (neutral)illos Reflexive se  se\n\n Demonstrative: illo (it, far), isto (it, near), ipso (itself); for conjunction: que (me vide que illo es rapide = I see that it is fast)\n Possessive: meo, tuo, suo, nostro, vestro, (suo)\n Relative and conjunctive: qui (who, that human), quod (which, that thing)\n Reflexive: se\n Indefinitive: un, uno (One tells...), ullo (any), omne or omni (all, each, every), aliquo (anyone), nullo (nothing), nemo (noone)\n\nVerbs\nVerbs are formed from the Latin by dropping the final -re of the infinitive. Tense, mood, etc., are indicated by particles, auxiliary verbs, or adverbs, but none is required if the sense is clear from the context.  If needed, the past may be indicated by preceding the verb with e, and the future with i.\n\nThere are specific endings to create the infinitive and participles:\n basic form: ama (loves)\n infinitive: amare (to love)\n passive participle: amato (loved)\n active participle: amante (loving)\n\nCollateral endingsManuale Practico de Interlingua .

Germania omnis a Gallis Raetisque et Pannoniis Rheno et Danuvio fluminibus, a Sarmatis Dacisque mutuo metu aut montibus separatur: cetera Oceanus ambit, latos sinus et insularum inmensa spatia complectens, nuper cognitis quibusdam gentibus ac regibus, quos bellum aperuit. Rhenus, Raeticarum Alpium inaccesso ac praecipiti vertice ortus, modico flexu in occidentem versus septentrionali Oceano miscetur. Danuvius molli et clementer edito montis Abnobae iugo effusus pluris populos adit, donec in Ponticum mare sex meatibus erumpat: septimum os paludibus hauritur. Fluvios Rheno et Danuvio separa toto Germania ab Gallos, Raetos et Pannonios; montes, aut metu mutuo, separa illo ab Sarmatas et Dacos: Oceano ambi ceteros, complectente sinus lato de mari et spatios immenso de insulas, ad certo gentes et reges recente cognito, aperto ab bello. Rheno, orto in vertice inaccesso et praecipite de Alpes Raetico, flecte se parvo versus occidente et misce se in Oceano septentrionale. Danuvio, effuso in jugo molle et clemente edito de monte Abnoba, visita plure populo, usque illo erumpe in mari Pontico per sex cursu: ore septimo perde se in paludes. \n\n Criticism \nPeano formally defended the maxim that the best grammar is no grammar, bearing in mind the example of Chinese.In modern linguistics, counter to popular \u2013 and Peano's \u2013 usage, grammar does not refer to morphological structures alone, but also to syntax and phonology, for example, which both Latino sine flexione and Chinese still have. In this sense, \"languages without grammar\" cannot exist. According to Lancelot Hogben, Peano\u2019s Interlingua still shares a major flaw with many other auxiliary languages, having \"either too much grammar of the wrong sort, or not enough of the right\".  (p.\u00a010)\nHogben argues that at least nouns and verbs should be easily distinguished by characteristic endings, so that one can easily get an initial understanding of the sentence. Thus, in Peano\u2019s Interlingua the verbs might be given some specific, standardized verbal form, such as the infinitive, which is sufficient at the Latin indirect speech. Instead, the raw imperative is proposed in De Latino Sine Flexione:\n\nAccording to Hogben, another handicap is the lack of a pure article, which might clearly indicate the nouns. Nevertheless, Peano occasionally suggested that illo (that) and uno (one) might be used as articles.\n\nOnce more according to Hogben, the syntax of Peano\u2019s Interlingua remained conservative:\n\nReviewing the list of more widely known Latin titles, one might conclude that the sequence noun-adjective is the norm in Latin, yet the inverted sequence is also current.\u201cNote on Peano\u2019s Interlingua\u201d . Updated: June 2014. The ratio is over 2 to 1 in a list of Latin titles commented by Stroh.Stroh, Wilfried (2009). Le latin est mort. Vive la latin! [2007. Latein ist tot, es lebe Latein]. Paris: Les Belles Lettres. . E.g. \u201cPrincipia Mathematica\u201d.\nAs for a sequence nominative-genitive, it may be the norm in Latin in a similar ratio. E.g. \u201cSystema Naturae\u201d. Indeed, the sequence nominative-genitive must always be the norm in Peano\u2019s Interlingua, since the preposition de must introduce the genitive. Thus, Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica would turn into Principio Mathematico de Philosophia Naturale. Since the function of both the adjective and the genitive is often the same, one might infer that the sequence noun-adjective might always be the norm.\n\n See also \n\n Med\u017euslovjanski or Interslavic, a zonal IAL for Slavic Languages following a similar philosophy\n Dog Latin - imitation of Latin using words from other languages\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Instituto pro Latino sine flexione - Site in Latino sine flexione; Peano's original writings on this language, blog in Latino sine flexione, etc.\n Blog in Latino sine Flexione\n (Latino sine flexione) 100 exemplo de Interlingua, ab Giuseppe Peano\n (Latino sine flexione) Revista \"Discussiones\", de Academia Pro Interlingua (1909-13)\n Nuntios: Latino sine Flexione in http://nuntios.blogspot.com/\n\nCategory:International auxiliary languages\nCategory:Simplified languages\nCategory:Constructed languages introduced in the 1900s\nCategory:1903 introductions"}

Appel and Haken's proof of this took 139 pages, and also depended on long computer calculations.\n1974 The Gorenstein\u2013Harada theorem classifying finite groups of sectional 2-rank at most 4 was 464 pages long.\n1976 Eisenstein series Langlands's proof of the functional equation for Eisenstein series was 337 pages long.\n1983 Trichotomy theorem Gorenstein and Lyons's proof for the case of rank at least 4 was 731 pages long, and Aschbacher's proof of the rank 3 case adds another 159 pages, for a total of 890 pages.\n1983 Selberg trace formula Hejhal's proof of a general form of the Selberg trace formula consisted of 2 volumes with a total length of 1322 pages.\nArthur\u2013Selberg trace formula. Arthur's proofs of the various versions of this cover several hundred pages spread over many papers.\n2000 Almgren's regularity theorem Almgren's proof was 955 pages long.\n2000 Lafforgue's theorem on the Langlands conjecture for the general linear group over function fields. Laurent Lafforgue's proof of this was about 600 pages long, not counting many pages of background results.\n2003 Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, Geometrization theorem, Geometrization conjecture. Perelman's original proofs of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and the Geometrization conjecture were not lengthy, but were rather sketchy. Several other mathematicians have published proofs with the details filled in, which come to several hundred pages.\n2004 Quasithin groups The classification of the simple quasithin groups by Aschbacher and Smith was 1221 pages long, one of the longest single papers ever written.\n2004 Classification of finite simple groups. The proof of this is spread out over hundreds of journal articles which makes it hard to estimate its total length, which is probably around 10000 to 20000 pages.\n2004 Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem. The proof takes about 500 pages spread over about 20 papers.\n2005 Kepler conjecture Hales's proof of this involves several hundred pages of published arguments, together with several gigabytes of computer calculations.\n2006 the strong perfect graph theorem, by Maria Chudnovsky, Neil Robertson, Paul Seymour, and Robin Thomas. 180 pages in the Annals of Mathematics.\n\nLong computer calculations\n\nThere are many mathematical theorems that have been checked by long computer calculations. If these were written out as proofs many would be far longer than most of the proofs above. There is not really a clear distinction between computer calculations and proofs, as several of the proofs above, such as the 4-color theorem and the Kepler conjecture, use long computer calculations as well as many pages of mathematical argument. For the computer calculations in this section, the mathematical arguments are only a few pages long, and the length is due to long but routine calculations.  Some typical examples of such theorems include:\n\nSeveral proofs of the existence of sporadic simple groups, such as the Lyons group,  originally used computer calculations with large matrices or with permutations on billions of symbols. In most cases, such as the baby monster group, the computer proofs were later replaced by shorter proofs avoiding computer calculations. Similarly, the calculation of the maximal subgroups of the larger sporadic groups uses a lot of computer calculations.\n2004 Verification of the Riemann hypothesis for the first 1013 zeros of the Riemann zeta function.\n2007 Verification that Checkers is a draw.\n2008 Proofs that various Mersenne numbers with around ten million digits are prime.\nCalculations of large numbers of digits of \u03c0.\n2010 Showing that Rubik's Cube can be solved in 20 moves.\n2012 Showing that  Sudoku needs at least 17 clues.\n2013 Ternary Goldbach conjecture: Every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. \n2014 Proof of Erd\u0151s discrepancy conjecture for particular case C=2: every \u00b11-sequence of the length 1161 has a discrepancy at least 3, original proof generated by a SAT solver, had a size of 13 gigabytes and was later reduced to 850 megabytes.\n2016 Solving boolean Pythagorean triples problem required the generation of 200 terabytes of proof.\n2017 Heule, who coauthored solution to the boolean Pythagorean triples problem, announced 2 petabytes long proof that 5th Schur's number is 161.\n\nLong proofs in mathematical logic\n\nKurt G\u00f6del showed how to find explicit examples of statements in formal systems that are provable in that system but whose shortest proof is absurdly long. For example, the statement:\n\"This statement cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic in less than a googolplex symbols\"\nis provable in Peano arithmetic but the shortest proof has at least a googolplex symbols. It has a short proof in a more powerful system: in fact, it is easily provable in Peano arithmetic together with the statement that Peano arithmetic is consistent (which cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem).\n\nIn this argument, Peano arithmetic can be replaced by any more powerful consistent system, and a googolplex can be replaced by any number that can be described concisely in the system.\n\nHarvey Friedman found some explicit natural examples of this phenomenon, giving some explicit statements in Peano arithmetic and other formal systems  whose shortest proofs  are ridiculously long . For example, the statement\n\"there is an integer n such that if there is a sequence of rooted trees T1, T2, ..., Tn such that Tk has at most k+10 vertices, then some tree can be homeomorphically embedded in a later one\"\nis provable in Peano arithmetic, but the shortest proof has length at least A(1000), where A(0)=1 and A(n+1)=2A(n). The statement is a special case of Kruskal's theorem and has a short proof in second order arithmetic.\n\nSee also\n\nList of incomplete proofs\nProof by intimidation\n\nReferences\n\nPublished Incomplete Proofs\nCategory:Theorems\nCategory:Mathematical proofs"}
{"title": "Logical connective", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective", "text": "In logic, a logical connective (also called a logical operator, sentential connective, or sentential operator) is a symbol or word used to connect two or more sentences (of either a formal or a natural language) in a grammatically valid way, such that the value of the compound sentence produced depends only on that of the original sentences and on the meaning of the connective.\n\nThe most common logical connectives are binary connectives (also called dyadic connectives) which join two sentences which can be thought of as the function's operands. Also commonly, negation is considered to be a unary connective.\n\nLogical connectives along with quantifiers are the two main types of logical constants used in formal systems such as propositional logic and predicate logic. Semantics of a logical connective is often, but not always, presented as a truth function.\n\nA logical connective is similar to but not equivalent to a conditional operator.\n\nIn language\n\nNatural language\nIn the grammar of natural languages two sentences may be joined by a grammatical conjunction to form a grammatically compound sentence. Some but not all such grammatical conjunctions are truth functional. For example, consider the following sentences:\n\nThe words and and so are grammatical conjunctions joining the sentences (A) and (B)  to form the compound sentences (C) and (D). The and in (C) is a logical connective, since the truth of (C) is completely determined by (A) and (B): it would make no sense to affirm (A) and (B) but deny (C). However, so in (D) is not a logical connective, since it would be quite reasonable to affirm (A) and (B) but deny (D): perhaps, after all, Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water, not because Jack had gone up the hill at all.\n\nVarious English words and word pairs express logical connectives, and some of them are synonymous. Examples are:\n\n Word  Connective  Symbol  Logical gate and  conjunction  \"\u2227\"  AND and then  conjunction  \"\u2227\"  AND and then within  conjunction  \"\u2227\"  AND or  disjunction  \"\u2228\"  OR either...or  exclusive disjunction  \"\u22bb\"  XOR either, but not both  exclusive disjunction  \"\u22bb\"  XOR implies  material implication  \"\u2192\"  IMPLY is implied by  converse implication  \"\u2190\"   if...then  material implication   \"\u2192\"   IMPLY ...if  converse implication  \"\u2190\"  if and only if  biconditional  \"\u2194\"  XNOR only if  converse implication  \"\u2190\"   just in case  biconditional  \"\u2194\"  XNOR but  conjunction  \"\u2227\"  AND however  conjunction  \"\u2227\"  AND not both  alternative denial  \"\u2191\"  NAND neither...nor  joint denial  \"\u2193\"  NOR not, not that negation  \"\u00ac\"  NOT it is false that  negation  \"\u00ac\"  NOT it is not the case that  negation  \"\u00ac\"  NOT although  conjunction  \"\u2227\"  AND even though  conjunction  \"\u2227\"  AND therefore   material implication   \"\u2192\"   IMPLY so   material implication   \"\u2192\"   IMPLY that is to say  biconditional  \"\u2194\"  XNOR furthermore  conjunction  \"\u2227\"  AND but not  material nonimplication  \"\u219b\"   NIMPLY not...but  converse nonimplication  \"\u219a\"  no...without  material implication  \"\u2192\"   IMPLY without...there is no  converse implication  \"\u2190\"  \n\nFormal languages\nIn formal languages, truth functions are represented by unambiguous symbols. These symbols are called logical connectives, logical operators, propositional operators, or, in classical logic, truth-functional connectives. See well-formed formula for the rules which allow new well-formed formulas to be constructed by joining other well-formed formulas using truth-functional connectives.\n\nLogical connectives can be used to link more than two statements, so one can speak about -ary logical connective.\n\nCommon logical connectives\n  Symbol, name\n  Truth table\n  Venn diagram\n   Unary connectives\n    \u00a0=\n  0\n  1\n    \u22a4  Truth/tautology\n   1\n  1\n  32px\n    Proposition \n   0\n  1\n  32px\n   \u22a5  Falsity/contradiction\n   0\n  0\n  32px\n   \u00ac  Negation\n   1\n  0\n  32px\n\n   Binary connectives\n    \u00a0=\n  0\n  1\n   \u00a0=\n  0\n  1\n  0\n  1\n    Proposition \n  0011 40px\n    Proposition \n  0101 40px\n   \u2227  Conjunction\n  0001 40px\n   \u2191  Alternative denial\n  1110 40px\n   \u2228  Disjunction\n  0111 40px\n   \u2193  Joint denial\n  1000 40px\n   \u2192  Material conditional\n  1101 40px\n     Exclusive or\n  0110 40px\n   \u2194  Biconditional\n  1001 40px\n   \u2190  Converse implication\n  1011 40px\n   More information\n \n\nList of common logical connectives\nCommonly used logical connectives include\n Negation (not): \u00ac\u2009, N (prefix), ~\n Conjunction (and): \u2227\u2009, K (prefix), &\u2009, \u2219\n Disjunction (or): \u2228, A (prefix)\n Material implication (if...then): \u2192\u2009, C (prefix), \u21d2\u2009, \u2283\n Biconditional (if and only if): \u2194\u2009, E (prefix), \u2261\u2009, =\n\nAlternative names for biconditional are iff, xnor, and bi-implication.\n\nFor example, the meaning of the statements it is raining and I am indoors is transformed when the two are combined with logical connectives. For statement P = It is raining and Q = I am indoors:\n It is not raining (P)\n It is raining and  I am indoors ()\n It is raining or I am indoors ()\n If it is raining, then I am indoors ()\n If I am indoors, then it is raining ()\n I am indoors if and only if it is raining ()\n\nIt is also common to consider the always true formula and the always false formula to be connective:\n True formula (\u22a4, 1, V [prefix], or T)\n False formula (\u22a5, 0, O [prefix], or F)\n\nHistory of notations\n Negation: the symbol \u00ac appeared in Heyting in 1929.Heyting (1929) Die formalen Regeln der intuitionistischen Logik.Denis Roegel,;l,;l.';, (2002), Petit panorama des notations logiques du 20e si\u00e8cle (see chart on page 2). (compare to Frege's symbol \u2adf in his Begriffsschrift); the symbol ~ appeared in Russell in 1908;Russell (1908) Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types (American Journal of Mathematics 30, p222\u2013262, also in From Frege to G\u00f6del edited by van Heijenoort). an alternative notation is to add a horizontal line on top of the formula, as in ; another alternative notation is to use a prime symbol as in P'.\n Conjunction: the symbol \u2227 appeared in Heyting in 1929 (compare to Peano's use of the set-theoretic notation of intersection \u2229Peano (1889) Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita.); & appeared at least in Sch\u00f6nfinkel in 1924;Sch\u00f6nfinkel (1924)  \u00dcber die Bausteine der mathematischen Logik, translated as On the building blocks of mathematical logic in From Frege to G\u00f6del edited by van Heijenoort. . comes from Boole's interpretation of logic as an elementary algebra.\n Disjunction: the symbol \u2228 appeared in Russell in 1908 (compare to Peano's use of the set-theoretic notation of union \u222a); the symbol + is also used, in spite of the ambiguity coming from the fact that the + of ordinary elementary algebra is an exclusive or when interpreted logically in a two-element ring; punctually in the history a + together with a dot in the lower right corner has been used by Peirce,<ref>Peirce (1867) On an improvement in Boole's calculus of logic.</ref>\n Implication: the symbol \u2192 can be seen in Hilbert in 1917;Hilbert (1917/1918) Prinzipien der Mathematik (Bernays' course notes). \u2283 was used by Russell in 1908 (compare to Peano's inverted C notation); \u21d2 was used in Vax.Vax (1982) Lexique logique, Presses Universitaires de France.\n Biconditional: the symbol \u2261 was used at least by Russell in 1908; \u2194 was used at least by Tarski in 1940;Tarski (1940) Introduction to logic and to the methodology of deductive sciences. \u21d4 was used in Vax; other symbols appeared punctually in the history such as \u2283\u2282 in Gentzen,Gentzen (1934) Untersuchungen \u00fcber das logische Schlie\u00dfen. ~ in Sch\u00f6nfinkel or \u2282\u2283 in Chazal.Chazal (1996) : \u00c9l\u00e9ments de logique formelle.\n True: the symbol 1 comes from Boole's interpretation of logic as an elementary algebra over the two-element Boolean algebra; other notations include  to be found in Peano.\n False: the symbol 0 comes also from Boole's interpretation of logic as a ring; other notations include  to be found in Peano.\n\nSome authors used letters for connectives at some time of the history: u. for conjunction (German's \"und\" for \"and\") and o. for disjunction (German's \"oder\" for \"or\") in earlier works by Hilbert (1904); Np for negation, Kpq for conjunction, Dpq for alternative denial, Apq for disjunction, Xpq for joint denial, Cpq for implication, Epq for biconditional in \u0141ukasiewicz (1929);See Roegel cf. Polish notation.\n\nRedundancy\n\nSuch a logical connective as converse implication \"\u2190\" is actually the same as material conditional with swapped arguments; thus, the symbol for converse implication is redundant. In some logical calculi (notably, in classical logic) certain essentially different compound statements are logically equivalent. A less trivial example of a redundancy is the classical equivalence between  and . Therefore, a classical-based logical system does not need the conditional operator \"\u2192\" if \"\u00ac\" (not) and \"\u2228\" (or) are already in use, or may use the \"\u2192\" only as a syntactic sugar for a compound having one negation and one disjunction.\n\nThere are sixteen Boolean functions associating the input truth values  and  with four-digit binary outputs.Boche\u0144ski (1959), A Pr\u00e9cis of Mathematical Logic, passim. These correspond to possible choices of binary logical connectives for classical logic. Different implementations of classical logic can choose different functionally complete subsets of connectives.\n\nOne approach is to choose a minimal set, and define other connectives by some logical form, as in the example with the material conditional above.\nThe following are the minimal functionally complete sets of operators in classical logic whose arities do not exceed 2:\nOne element {\u2191}, {\u2193}.\nTwo elements , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .\nThree elements , , , , , .\n\nAnother approach is to use with equal rights connectives of a certain convenient and functionally complete, but not minimal set. This approach requires more propositional axioms, and each equivalence between logical forms must be either an axiom or provable as a theorem.\n\nThe situation, however, is more complicated in intuitionistic logic.   Of its five connectives, {\u2227,\u2009\u2228,\u2009\u2192,\u2009\u00ac,\u2009\u22a5}, only negation \"\u00ac\" can be reduced to other connectives (see details). Neither conjunction, disjunction, nor material conditional has an equivalent form constructed of the other four logical connectives.\n\nProperties\nSome logical connectives possess properties which may be expressed in the theorems containing the connective. Some of those properties that a logical connective may have are:\n\n Associativity Within an expression containing two or more of the same associative connectives in a row, the order of the operations does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.\n Commutativity The operands of the connective may be swapped preserving logical equivalence to the original expression.\n Distributivity A connective denoted by \u00b7 distributes over another connective denoted by +, if  for all operands , , .\n Idempotence Whenever the operands of the operation are the same, the compound is logically equivalent to the operand.\n Absorption A pair of connectives \u2227, \u2228 satisfies the absorption law if  for all operands , .\n Monotonicity If f(a1, ..., an) \u2264 f(b1, ..., bn) for all a1, ..., an, b1, ..., bn \u2208 {0,1} such that a1 \u2264 b1, a2 \u2264 b2, ..., an \u2264 bn. E.g., \u2228, \u2227, \u22a4, \u22a5.\n Affinity Each variable always makes a difference in the truth-value of the operation or it never makes a difference. E.g., \u00ac, \u2194,  , \u22a4, \u22a5.\n Duality To read the truth-value assignments for the operation from top to bottom on its truth table is the same as taking the complement of reading the table of the same or another connective from bottom to top. Without resorting to truth tables it may be formulated as . E.g., \u00ac.\n Truth-preserving The compound all those argument are tautologies is a tautology itself. E.g., \u2228, \u2227, \u22a4, \u2192, \u2194, \u2282 (see validity).\n Falsehood-preserving The compound all those argument are contradictions is a contradiction itself. E.g., \u2228, \u2227, , \u22a5, \u2284, \u2285 (see validity).\n Involutivity (for unary connectives) . E.g. negation in classical logic.\n\nFor classical and intuitionistic logic, the \"=\" symbol means that corresponding implications \"\u2026\u2192\u2026\" and \"\u2026\u2190\u2026\" for logical compounds can be both proved as theorems, and the \"\u2264\" symbol means that \"\u2026\u2192\u2026\" for logical compounds is a consequence of corresponding \"\u2026\u2192\u2026\" connectives for propositional variables. Some many-valued logics may have incompatible definitions of equivalence and order (entailment).\n\nBoth conjunction and disjunction are associative, commutative and idempotent in classical logic, most varieties of many-valued logic and intuitionistic logic. The same is true about distributivity of conjunction over disjunction and disjunction over conjunction, as well as for the absorption law.\n\nIn classical logic and some varieties of many-valued logic, conjunction and disjunction are dual, and negation is self-dual, the latter is also self-dual in intuitionistic logic. \n\nOrder of precedence\nAs a way of reducing the number of necessary parentheses, one may introduce precedence rules: \u00ac has higher precedence than \u2227, \u2227 higher than \u2228, and \u2228 higher than \u2192. So for example,  is short for .\n\nHere is a table that shows a commonly used precedence of logical operators..\n\nHowever, not all compilers use the same order; for instance, an ordering in which disjunction is lower precedence than implication or bi-implication has also been used.. Sometimes precedence between conjunction and disjunction is unspecified requiring to provide it explicitly in given formula with parentheses. The order of precedence determines which connective is the \"main connective\" when interpreting a non-atomic formula.\n\nComputer science\n\nA truth-functional approach to logical operators is implemented as logic gates in digital circuits. Practically all digital circuits (the major exception is DRAM) are built up from NAND, NOR, NOT, and transmission gates; see more details in Truth function in computer science. Logical operators over bit vectors (corresponding to finite Boolean algebras) are bitwise operations.\n\nBut not every usage of a logical connective in computer programming has a Boolean semantic. For example, lazy evaluation is sometimes implemented for  and , so these connectives are not commutative if either or both of the expressions ,  have side effects. Also, a conditional, which in some sense corresponds to the material conditional connective, is essentially non-Boolean because for if (P) then Q; the consequent\u00a0Q is not executed if the antecedent\u00a0P is false (although a compound as a whole is successful \u2248 \"true\" in such case). This is closer to intuitionist and constructivist views on the material conditional, rather than to classical logic's ones.\n\nSee also\n\n Boolean domain\n Boolean function\n Boolean logic\n Boolean-valued function\n List of Boolean algebra topics\n\n Logical constant\n Modal operator\n Propositional calculus\n Truth function\n Truth table\n Truth values\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Boche\u0144ski, J\u00f3zef Maria (1959), A Pr\u00e9cis of Mathematical Logic'', translated from the French and German editions by Otto Bird, D.

{"title": "Mathematics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "text": "thumb|Euclid (holding calipers), Greek mathematician, 3rd century BC, as imagined by Raphael in this detail from The School of Athens.\n\nMathematics (from Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 m\u00e1th\u0113ma, \"knowledge, study, learning\") includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change. It has no generally accepted definition.\n\nMathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.\n\nRigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858\u20131932), David Hilbert (1862\u20131943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th\u00a0century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.Eves, p. 306\n\nMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.Peterson, p. 12\n\nHistory\n\nthumb|The Babylonian mathematical tablet Plimpton 322, dated to 1800 BC.\nthumb|right|Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to approximate the value of pi.\nthumb|right|350px|The numerals used in the Bakhshali manuscript, dated between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE.\nThe history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals, was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.\n\nAs evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time\u00a0\u2013 days, seasons, years.See, for example, Raymond L. Wilder, Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study, passim\n\nEvidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000\u00a0BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy.Kline 1990, Chapter 1. The most ancient mathematical texts from Mesopotamia and Egypt are from 2000\u20131800 BC. Many early texts mention Pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a sexagesimal numeral system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.\n\nBeginning in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, the Ancient Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with Greek mathematics. Around 300 BC, Euclid introduced the axiomatic method still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His textbook Elements is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time. The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be Archimedes (c. 287\u2013212 BC) of Syracuse. He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of solids of revolution and used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus. Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are conic sections (Apollonius of Perga, 3rd century BC), trigonometry (Hipparchus of Nicaea (2nd century BC), and the beginnings of algebra (Diophantus, 3rd century AD).\n\nThe Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition of sine and cosine, and an early form of infinite series.\n\nleft|thumb|200px|A page from al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b's Algebra\nDuring the Golden Age of Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th\u00a0centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of Islamic mathematics was the development of algebra. Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in spherical trigonometry and the addition of the decimal point to the Arabic numeral system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as Al-Khwarismi, Omar Khayyam and Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b.\n\nDuring the early modern period, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in Western Europe. The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. Leonhard Euler was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory, number theory, and statistics. In the early 20th century, Kurt G\u00f6del transformed mathematics by publishing his incompleteness theorems, which show that any axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.\n\nMathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January\u00a02006 issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, \"The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical Reviews database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9\u00a0million, and more than 75\u00a0thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\"\n\nEtymology\nThe word mathematics comes from Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 (m\u00e1th\u0113ma), meaning \"that which is learnt\", \"what one gets to know\", hence also \"study\" and \"science\". The word for \"mathematics\" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning \"mathematical study\" even in Classical times.Both meanings can be found in Plato, the narrower in Republic 510c, but Plato did not use a math- word; Aristotle did, commenting on it. . OED Online , \"Mathematics\". Its adjective is  (math\u0113matik\u00f3s), meaning \"related to learning\" or \"studious\", which likewise further came to mean \"mathematical\". In particular,  (math\u0113matik\u1e17 t\u00e9khn\u0113), , meant \"the mathematical art\".\n\nSimilarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the math\u0113matikoi (\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af)\u2014which at the time meant \"teachers\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense.\n\nIn Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of mathematici, meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.\n\nThe apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form  (and the less commonly used singular derivative ), goes back to the Latin neuter plural  (Cicero), based on the Greek plural  (ta math\u0113matik\u00e1), used by Aristotle (384\u2013322\u00a0BC), and meaning roughly \"all things mathematical\"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, which were inherited from Greek.The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, Oxford English Dictionary, sub \"mathematics\", \"mathematic\", \"mathematics\" In English, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to maths or, in North America, math.\"maths, n.\" and \"math, n.3\". Oxford English Dictionary, on-line version (2012).\n\nDefinitions of mathematics\n\nthumb|upright|Leonardo Fibonacci, the Italian mathematician who introduced the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system invented between the 1st and 4th\u00a0centuries by Indian mathematicians, to the Western World\nMathematics has no generally accepted definition. Aristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. In the 19th\u00a0century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as group theory and projective geometry, which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions. Three leading types of definition of mathematics today are called logicist, intuitionist, and formalist, each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought. All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.\n\nAn early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was Benjamin Peirce's \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\" (1870). In the Principia Mathematica, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead advanced the philosophical program known as logicism, and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of symbolic logic. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's \"All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic\" (1903).\n\nIntuitionist definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer, identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is \"Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other.\" A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.\n\nFormalist definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. Haskell Curry defined mathematics simply as \"the science of formal systems\". A formal system is a set of symbols, or tokens, and some rules telling how the tokens may be combined into formulas. In formal systems, the word axiom has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of \"a self-evident truth\". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.\n\nA great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable. There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science. Some just say, \"Mathematics is what mathematicians do.\"\n\nMathematics as science\nupright|thumb|left|Carl Friedrich Gauss, known as the prince of mathematicians\nThe German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences\".Waltershausen, p. 79 More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics \"the Queen of Science\u00a0... the main driving force behind scientific discovery\". In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum, as well as in German K\u00f6nigin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding to science means a \"field of knowledge\", and this was the original meaning of \"science\" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting the meaning of \"science\" to natural science follows the rise of Baconian science, which contrasted \"natural science\" to scholasticism, the Aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as biology, chemistry, or physics. Albert Einstein stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"Einstein, p. 28. The quote is Einstein's answer to the question: \"How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?\" This question was inspired by Eugene Wigner's paper \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences\".\n\nMany philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science according to the definition of Karl Popper. However, in the 1930s G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems convinced many mathematicians that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that \"most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently.\"Popper 1995, p. 56 Other thinkers, notably Imre Lakatos, have applied a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself.Imre Lakatos (1976), Proofs and Refutations. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\n\nAn alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as theoretical physics) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.\n\nThe opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematiciansSee, for example Bertrand Russell's statement \"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ...\" in his History of Western Philosophy feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as in art) or discovered (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics, indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nInspiration, pure and applied mathematics, and aesthetics\n\nMathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, land measurement, architecture and later astronomy; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the physicist Richard Feynman invented the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's string theory, a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental forces of nature, continues to inspire new mathematics.\n\nSome mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between pure mathematics and applied mathematics. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. number theory in cryptography. This remarkable fact, that even the \"purest\" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what Eugene Wigner has called \"the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics\". As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics Subject Classification runs to 46\u00a0pages. Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, operations research, and computer science.\n\nFor those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the elegance of mathematics, its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty. Simplicity and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant proof, such as Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, and in an elegant numerical method that speeds calculation, such as the fast Fourier transform. G. H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic. Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a mathematical object. A theorem expressed as a characterization of the object by these features is the prize. Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments has been published in Proofs from THE BOOK.\n\nThe popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions. And at the other social extreme, philosophers continue to find problems in philosophy of mathematics, such as the nature of mathematical proof.\n\nNotation, language, and rigor\n\nupright|thumb|Leonhard Euler created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today.\n\nMost of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century. Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.Kline, p. 140, on Diophantus; p. 261, on Vieta. Euler (1707\u20131783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to Barbara Oakley, this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more abstract and more encrypted than those of natural language.Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language.\" Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as cow) with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live cow chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters c\u2013o\u2013w on the page. But you can't point to a real live plus sign that the symbol '+' is modeled after \u2013 the idea underlying the plus sign is more abstract.\" Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"By encryptedness, I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition.\"\n\nMathematical language can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as or and only, have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as open and field refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as iff for \"if and only if\" belong to mathematical jargon. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as \"rigor\".\n\nMathematical proof is fundamentally a matter of rigor. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken \"theorems\", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject. The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of Isaac Newton the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th\u00a0century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about computer-assisted proofs. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.Ivars Peterson, The Mathematical Tourist, Freeman, 1988, . p. 4 \"A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly\", (in reference to the Haken\u2013Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).\n\nAxioms in traditional thought were \"self-evident truths\", but that conception is problematic.\"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil.\" Bertrand Russell (1919), Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, New York and London, p. 71.  At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system. It was the goal of Hilbert's program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has undecidable formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.Patrick Suppes, Axiomatic Set Theory, Dover, 1972, . p. 1, \"Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects.\"\n\nFields of mathematics\n\nright|thumb|The abacus is a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.\nMathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to logic, to set theory (foundations), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences (applied mathematics), and more recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty. While some areas might seem unrelated, the Langlands program has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.\n\nFoundations and philosophy\nIn order to clarify the foundations of mathematics, the fields of mathematical logic and set theory were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections of objects. Category theory, which deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase \"crisis of foundations\" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.Luke Howard Hodgkin & Luke Hodgkin, A History of Mathematics, Oxford University Press, 2005. Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the controversy over Cantor's set theory and the Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy.\n\nMathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous axiomatic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems which (informally) imply that any effective formal system that contains basic arithmetic, if sound (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily incomplete (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved in that system). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, G\u00f6del showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into recursion theory, model theory, and proof theory, and is closely linked to theoretical computer science, as well as to category theory. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a consequence of the MRDP theorem.\n\nTheoretical computer science includes computability theory, computational complexity theory, and information theory. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model\u00a0\u2013 the Turing machine. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the \"\" problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems.Clay Mathematics Institute, P=NP, claymath.org Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as compression and entropy.\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n||| 128px || 96px || 96px\n|-\n|Mathematical logic || Set theory || Category theory || Theory of computation\n|}\n\nPure mathematics\nQuantity\n\nThe study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers (\"whole numbers\") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in arithmetic. The deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory, from which come such popular results as Fermat's Last Theorem. The twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture are two unsolved problems in number theory.\n\nAs the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers (\"fractions\"). These, in turn, are contained within the real numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities. Real numbers are generalized to complex numbers. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and octonions. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers, which formalize the concept of \"infinity\". According to the fundamental theorem of algebra all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the cardinal numbers. These include the aleph numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"20\"\n| ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n|Natural numbers|| Integers || Rational numbers || Real numbers || Complex numbers\n|}\n\nStructure\n\nMany mathematical objects, such as sets of numbers and functions, exhibit internal structure as a consequence of operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.\n\nBy its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using Galois theory, which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra, which is the general study of vector spaces, whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n| || 96px || 96px || 96px || 96px || 96px\n|-\n|| Number theory || Algebra || Group theory || Combinatorics || Graph theory || Order theory \n|}\n\nSpace\n\nThe study of space originates with geometry\u00a0\u2013 in particular, Euclidean geometry, which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known Pythagorean theorem. Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, non-Euclidean geometries (which play a central role in general relativity) and topology. Quantity and space both play a role in analytic geometry, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. Convex and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer science. Within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus on manifolds, in particular, vector and tensor calculus. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of polynomial equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of topological groups, which combine structure and space. Lie groups are used to study space, structure, and change. Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes point-set topology, set-theoretic topology, algebraic topology and differential topology. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are metrizability theory, axiomatic set theory, homotopy theory, and Morse theory. Topology also includes the now solved Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture. Other results in geometry and topology, including the four color theorem and Kepler conjecture, have been proved only with the help of computers.\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|96px || 96px || 96px || 96px || 96px || 70px\n|-\n|Geometry || Trigonometry || Differential geometry || Topology || Fractal geometry || Measure theory\n|}\n\nChange\n\nUnderstanding and describing change is a common theme in the natural sciences, and calculus was developed as a tool to investigate it. Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex numbers. Functional analysis focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) spaces of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations. Many phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic behavior.\n\n96px  96px  96px  96px  96px  96pxCalculus  Vector calculus Differential equations  Complex analysis  Dynamical systems  Chaos theory\n\nApplied mathematics\n\nApplied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge. The term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, applied mathematics focuses on the \"formulation, study, and use of mathematical models\" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.\n\nIn the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics.\n\nStatistics and other decision sciences\n\nApplied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with probability theory. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) \"create data that makes sense\" with random sampling and with randomized experiments;Rao, C.R. (1997) Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work, World Scientific.  the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from observational studies, statisticians \"make sense of the data\" using the art of modelling and the theory of inference\u00a0\u2013 with model selection and estimation; the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested on new data.\n\nStatistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence. Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.: \n\nComputational mathematics\nComputational mathematics proposes and studies methods for solving mathematical problems that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory; numerical analysis includes the study of approximation and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding errors. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory. Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.\n\n96px 96px  96px  96px  96px  96px  96pxGame theory  Fluid dynamics  Numerical analysis  Optimization  Probability theory  Statistics  Cryptography96px  96px  96px  96px  96px  96pxMathematical finance  Mathematical physics  Mathematical chemistry  Mathematical biology Mathematical economics  Control theory\n\nMathematical awards\nArguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal, established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe Wolf Prize in Mathematics, instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the Abel Prize, was instituted in 2003. The Chern Medal was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.\n\nA famous list of 23 open problems, called \"Hilbert's problems\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the \"Millennium Prize Problems\", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the Riemann hypothesis, duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a $1\u00a0million reward.\n\nSee also\n\n International Mathematical Olympiad\n Lists of mathematics topics\n Mathematical sciences\n Mathematics and art\n Mathematics education\n National Museum of Mathematics\n Philosophy of mathematics\n Relationship between mathematics and physics\n Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .\n \n \n \n \n \n\nFurther reading\n\n \n \n \n \u00a0\u2013 A translated and expanded version of a Soviet mathematics encyclopedia, in ten volumes.

Pierre de Fermat was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique, adequality, for finding the maxima and minima of functions.\n\nAs defined in set theory, the maximum and minimum of a set are the greatest and least elements in the set, respectively. Unbounded infinite sets, such as the set of real numbers, have no minimum or maximum.\n\nDefinition\nA real-valued function f defined on a domain X has a global (or absolute) maximum point at x\u2217 if f(x\u2217) \u2265 f(x) for all x in X. Similarly, the function has a global (or absolute) minimum point at x\u2217 if f(x\u2217) \u2264 f(x) for all x in X. The value of the function at a maximum point is called the maximum value of the function and the value of the function at a minimum point is called the minimum value of the function. Symbolically, this can be written as follows:\n is a global maximum point of function  if  \nSimilarly for global minimum point.\n\nIf the domain X is a metric space then f is said to have a local (or relative) maximum point at the point x\u2217 if there exists some \u03b5 > 0 such that f(x\u2217) \u2265 f(x) for all x in X within distance \u03b5 of x\u2217. Similarly, the function has a local minimum point at x\u2217 if f(x\u2217) \u2264 f(x) for all x in X within distance \u03b5 of x\u2217. A similar definition can be used when X is a topological space, since the definition just given can be rephrased in terms of neighbourhoods. Mathematically, the given definition is written as follows:\nLet  be a metric space and function . Then  is a local maximum point of function   if  such that \n\nSimilarly for a local minimum point.\n\nIn both the global and local cases, the concept of a strict extremum can be defined. For example, x\u2217 is a strict global maximum point if, for all x in X with x \u2260 x\u2217, we have f(x\u2217) > f(x), and x\u2217 is a strict local maximum point if there exists some \u03b5 > 0 such that, for all x in X within distance \u03b5 of x\u2217 with x \u2260 x\u2217, we have f(x\u2217) > f(x). Note that a point is a strict global maximum point if and only if it is the unique global maximum point, and similarly for minimum points.\n\nA continuous real-valued function with a compact domain always has a maximum point and a minimum point. An important example is a function whose domain is a closed (and bounded) interval of real numbers (see the graph above).\n\nSearch\nFinding global maxima and minima is the goal of mathematical optimization. If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then by the extreme value theorem global maxima and minima exist. Furthermore, a global maximum (or minimum) either must be a local maximum (or minimum) in the interior of the domain, or must lie on the boundary of the domain. So a method of finding a global maximum (or minimum) is to look at all the local maxima (or minima) in the interior, and also look at the maxima (or minima) of the points on the boundary, and take the largest (or smallest) one.\n\nLikely the most important, yet quite obvious, feature of continuous real-valued functions of a real variable is that they decrease before local minima and increase afterwards, likewise for maxima. (Formally, if f is continuous real-valued function of a real variable x then x0 is a local minimum iff there exist a<x0<b such that f decreases on (a,x0) and increases on (x0,b)) A direct consequence of this is the Fermat's theorem, which states that local extrema must occur at critical points. One can distinguish whether a critical point is a local maximum or local minimum by using the first derivative test, second derivative test, or higher-order derivative test, given sufficient differentiability.\n\nFor any function that is defined piecewise, one finds a maximum (or minimum) by finding the maximum (or minimum) of each piece separately, and then seeing which one is largest (or smallest).\n\nExamples\nthumb|right|The global maximum of  occurs at x = e.\n The function x2 has a unique global minimum at x = 0.\n The function x3 has no global minima or maxima.  Although the first derivative (3x2) is 0 at x = 0, this is an inflection point.\n The function  has a unique global maximum at x = e. (See figure at right)\n The function x\u2212x has a unique global maximum over the positive real numbers at x = 1/e.\n The function x3/3 \u2212 x has first derivative x2 \u2212 1 and second derivative 2x.  Setting the first derivative to 0 and solving for x gives stationary points at \u22121 and +1.  From the sign of the second derivative we can see that \u22121 is a local maximum and +1 is a local minimum.  Note that this function has no global maximum or minimum.\n The function |x| has a global minimum at x = 0 that cannot be found by taking derivatives, because the derivative does not exist at x = 0.\n The function cos(x) has infinitely many global maxima at 0, \u00b12, \u00b14, ..., and infinitely many global minima at \u00b1\u03c0, \u00b13\u03c0, ....\n The function 2 cos(x) \u2212 x has infinitely many local maxima and minima, but no global maximum or minimum.\n The function cos(3x)/x with 0.1\u00a0\u2264\u00a0x\u00a0\u2264\u00a01.1 has a global maximum at x\u00a0= 0.1 (a boundary), a global minimum near x\u00a0= 0.3, a local maximum near x\u00a0= 0.6, and a local minimum near x\u00a0= 1.0. (See figure at top of page.)\n The function x3 + 3x2 \u2212 2x + 1 defined over the closed interval (segment) [\u22124,2] has a local and maximum at x = \u22121\u2212/3, a local minimum at x = \u22121+/3, a global maximum at x = 2 and a global minimum at x = \u22124.\n\nFunctions of more than one variable\n\nthumb|Peano surface, a counterexample to some criteria of local maxima of the 19th century\nFor functions of more than one variable, similar conditions apply. For example, in the (enlargeable) figure at the right, the necessary conditions for a local maximum are similar to those of a function with only one variable. The first partial derivatives as to  z (the variable to be maximized) are zero at the maximum (the glowing dot on top in the figure).  The second partial derivatives are negative.  These are only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for a local maximum because of the possibility of a saddle point. For use of these conditions to solve for a maximum, the function z must also be differentiable throughout. The second partial derivative test can help classify the point as a relative maximum or relative minimum.\nIn contrast, there are substantial differences between functions of one variable and functions of more than one variable in the identification of global extrema. For example, if a bounded differentiable function f defined on a closed interval in the real line has a single critical point, which is a local minimum, then it is also a global minimum (use the intermediate value theorem and Rolle's theorem to prove this by reductio ad absurdum). In two and more dimensions, this argument fails, as the function\n\nshows. Its only critical point is at (0,0), which is a local minimum with \u0192(0,0)\u00a0=\u00a00. However, it cannot be a global one, because \u0192(2,3)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.\n\nMaxima or minima of a functional\nIf the domain of a function for which an extremum is to be found consists itself of functions, i.e. if an extremum is to be found of a functional, the extremum is found using the calculus of variations.\n\nIn relation to sets\nMaxima and minima can also be defined for sets. In general, if an ordered set S has a greatest element m, m is a maximal element. Furthermore, if S is a subset of an ordered set T and m is the greatest element of S with respect to order induced by T, m is a least upper bound of S in T. The similar result holds for least element, minimal element and greatest lower bound. The maximum and minimum function for sets are used in databases, and can be computed rapidly, since the maximum (or minimum) of a set can be computed from the maxima of a partition; formally, they are self-decomposable aggregation functions.\n\nIn the case of a general partial order, the least element (smaller than all other) should not be confused with a minimal element (nothing is smaller).  Likewise, a greatest element of a partially ordered set (poset) is an upper bound of the set which is contained within the set, whereas a maximal element m of a poset A is an element of A such that if m \u2264 b (for any b in A) then m = b. Any least element or greatest element of a poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements.  If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable.\n\nIn a totally ordered set, or chain, all elements are mutually comparable, so such a set can have at most one minimal element and at most one maximal element.  Then, due to mutual comparability, the minimal element will also be the least element and the maximal element will also be the greatest element. Thus in a totally ordered set we can simply use the terms minimum and maximum. If a chain is finite then it will always have a maximum and a minimum.  If a chain is infinite then it need not have a maximum or a minimum.  For example, the set of natural numbers has no maximum, though it has a minimum. If an infinite chain S is bounded, then the closure Cl(S) of the set occasionally has a minimum and a maximum, in such case they are called the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of the set S, respectively.\n\nSee also\nDerivative test\nInfimum and supremum\nLimit superior and limit inferior\nMechanical equilibrium\nSample maximum and minimum\nSaddle point\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMaxima and Minima From MathWorld\u2014A Wolfram Web Resource.\nThomas Simpson's work on Maxima and Minima at Convergence\nApplication of Maxima and Minima with sub pages of solved problems\n\nCategory:Calculus\nCategory:Mathematical analysis\nCategory:Mathematical optimization\nCategory:Superlatives"}

Here we see 2 being multiplied by 3 using scaling, giving 6 as a result.\nthumb|Animation for the multiplication 2 \u00d7 3 = 6.\nthumb|right|4 \u00d7 5 = 20. The large rectangle is composed of 20 squares, each having dimensions of 1 by 1.\nthumb|right|Area of a cloth ; \nMultiplication (often denoted by the cross symbol \"\u00d7\", by a point \"\u22c5\", by juxtaposition, or, on computers, by an asterisk \"\u2217\") is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic, with the others being addition, subtraction and division.\n\nThe multiplication of whole numbers may be thought as a repeated addition; that is, the multiplication of two numbers is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them, the multiplicand, as the value of the other one, the multiplier. The multiplier can be written first and multiplicand second (though the custom can vary by culture); both can be called factors.\n\nFor example, 4 multiplied by 3 (often written as  and spoken as \"3 times 4\") can be calculated by adding 3 copies of 4 together:\n\nHere 3 and 4 are the factors and 12 is the product.\n\nOne of the main properties of multiplication is the commutative property: adding 3 copies of 4 gives the same result as adding 4 copies of 3:\n\nThus the designation of multiplier and multiplicand does not affect the result of the multiplication.\n\nThe multiplication of integers (including negative numbers), rational numbers (fractions) and real numbers is defined by a systematic generalization of this basic definition.\n\nMultiplication can also be visualized as counting objects arranged in a rectangle (for whole numbers) or as finding the area of a rectangle whose sides have given lengths. The area of a rectangle does not depend on which side is measured first, which illustrates the commutative property. The product of two measurements is a new type of measurement, for instance multiplying the lengths of the two sides of a rectangle gives its area, this is the subject of dimensional analysis.\n\nThe inverse operation of multiplication is division. For example, since 4 multiplied by 3 equals 12, then 12 divided by 3 equals 4. Multiplication by 3, followed by division by 3, yields the original number (since the division of a number other than 0 by itself equals 1).\n\nMultiplication is also defined for other types of numbers, such as complex numbers, and more abstract constructs, like matrices. For some of these more abstract constructs, the order in which the operands are multiplied together matters. A listing of the many different kinds of products that are used in mathematics is given in the product (mathematics) page.\n\nNotation and terminology\n\nthumb|right|The multiplication sign \u00d7\nIn arithmetic, multiplication is often written using the sign \"\u00d7\" between the terms; that is, in infix notation. For example,\n (verbally, \"two times three equals six\")\n\nThe sign is encoded in Unicode at .\n\nThere are other mathematical notations for multiplication:\n Multiplication is also denoted by dot signs, usually a middle-position dot (rarely period):\n or \nThe middle dot notation, encoded in Unicode as , is standard in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries where the period is used as a decimal point. When the dot operator character is not accessible, the interpunct\u00a0(\u00b7) is used. In other countries that use a comma as a decimal mark, either the period or a middle dot is used for multiplication.\n In algebra, multiplication involving variables is often written as a juxtaposition (e.g., xy for x times y or 5x for five times x), also called implied multiplication. The notation can also be used for quantities that are surrounded by parentheses (e.g., 5(2) or (5)(2) for five times two). This implicit usage of multiplication can cause ambiguity when the concatenated variables happen to match the name of another variable, when a variable name in front of a parenthesis can be confused with a function name, or in the correct determination of the order of operations.\n In vector multiplication, there is a distinction between the cross and the dot symbols. The cross symbol generally denotes the taking a cross product of two vectors, yielding a vector as the result, while the dot denotes taking the dot product of two vectors, resulting in a scalar.\n\nIn computer programming, the asterisk (as in 5*2) is still the most common notation. This is due to the fact that most computers historically were limited to small character sets (such as ASCII and EBCDIC) that lacked a multiplication sign (such as \u22c5 or \u00d7), while the asterisk appeared on every keyboard. This usage originated in the FORTRAN programming language.\n\nThe numbers to be multiplied are generally called the \"factors\". The number to be multiplied is the \"multiplicand\", and the number by which it is multiplied is the \"multiplier\". Usually the multiplier is placed first and the multiplicand is placed second; however sometimes the first factor is the multiplicand and the second the multiplier.. Also as the result of a multiplication does not depend on the order of the factors, the distinction between \"multiplicand\" and \"multiplier\" is useful only at a very elementary level and in some multiplication algorithms, such as the long multiplication. Therefore, in some sources, the term \"multiplicand\" is regarded as a synonym for \"factor\". In algebra, a number that is the multiplier of a variable or expression (e.g., the 3 in 3xy2) is called a coefficient.\n\nThe result of a multiplication is called a product. A product of integers is a multiple of each factor. For example, 15 is the product of 3 and 5, and is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5.\n\nComputation\n200px|right|thumb|The Educated Monkey \u2013 a tin toy dated 1918, used as a multiplication \u201ccalculator\u201d. For example: set the monkey\u2019s feet to 4 and 9, and get the product \u2013 36 \u2013 in its hands.\n\nThe common methods for multiplying numbers using pencil and paper require a multiplication table of memorized or consulted products of small numbers (typically any two numbers from 0 to 9), however one method, the peasant multiplication algorithm, does not.\n\nMultiplying numbers to more than a couple of decimal places by hand is tedious and error prone. Common logarithms were invented to simplify such calculations, since adding logarithms is equivalent to multiplying. The slide rule allowed numbers to be quickly multiplied to about three places of accuracy. Beginning in the early 20th century, mechanical calculators, such as the Marchant, automated multiplication of up to 10\u00a0digit numbers. Modern electronic computers and calculators have greatly reduced the need for multiplication by hand.\n\nHistorical algorithms\nMethods of multiplication were documented in the Egyptian, Greek, Indian and Chinese civilizations.\n\nThe Ishango bone, dated to about 18,000 to 20,000\u00a0BC, hints at a knowledge of multiplication in the Upper Paleolithic era in Central Africa.\n\nEgyptians\n\nThe Egyptian method of multiplication of integers and fractions, documented in the Ahmes Papyrus, was by successive additions and doubling. For instance, to find the product of 13 and 21 one had to double 21 three times, obtaining , , . The full product could then be found by adding the appropriate terms found in the doubling sequence:\n13 \u00d7 21 = (1 + 4 + 8) \u00d7 21 = (1 \u00d7 21) + (4 \u00d7 21) + (8 \u00d7 21) = 21 + 84 + 168 = 273.\n\nBabylonians\nThe Babylonians used a sexagesimal positional number system, analogous to the modern day decimal system. Thus, Babylonian multiplication was very similar to modern decimal multiplication.  Because of the relative difficulty of remembering  different products, Babylonian mathematicians employed multiplication tables. These tables consisted of a list of the first twenty multiples of a certain principal number n: n, 2n, ..., 20n; followed by the multiples of 10n: 30n 40n, and 50n. Then to compute any sexagesimal product, say 53n, one only needed to add 50n and 3n computed from the table.\n\nChinese\n\nthumb|right|250px|\nIn the mathematical text Zhoubi Suanjing, dated prior to 300\u00a0BC, and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, multiplication calculations were written out in words, although the early Chinese mathematicians employed Rod calculus involving place value addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  Chinese were already using a decimal multiplication table since the Warring States period.\n\nModern methods\nright|250px|thumb|Product of 45 and 256. Note the order of the numerals in 45 is reversed down the left column. The carry step of the multiplication can be performed at the final stage of the calculation (in bold), returning the final product of . This is a variant of Lattice multiplication.\nThe modern method of multiplication based on the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system was first described by Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta gave rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Henry Burchard Fine, then professor of Mathematics at Princeton University, wrote the following:\nThe Indians are the inventors not only of the positional decimal system itself, but of most of the processes involved in elementary reckoning with the system. Addition and subtraction they performed quite as they are performed nowadays; multiplication they effected in many ways, ours among them, but division they did cumbrously.\nThese place value decimal arithmetic algorithms were introduced to Arab countries by Al Khwarizmi in the early 9th\u00a0century, and popularized in the Western world by Fibonacci in the 13th century.\n\nGrid Method\nGrid method multiplication or the box method, is used in primary schools in England and Wales & in some areas of the United States to help teach an understanding of how multiple digit multiplication works. An example of multiplying 34 by 13 would be to lay the numbers out in a grid like:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=15 style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"40pt\" | \u00a0\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"120pt\" | 30\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"40pt\" | 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 10\n|300\n|40\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n|90\n|12\n|}\n\nand then add the entries.\n\nComputer algorithms\n\nThe classical method of multiplying two -digit numbers requires  digit multiplications. Multiplication algorithms have been designed that reduce the computation time considerably when multiplying large numbers. Methods based on the discrete Fourier transform reduce the computational complexity to . Recently, the factor  has been replaced by a function that increases much slower although it is still not constant (as it can be hoped).\n\nIn March, 2019, David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven submitted an article presenting an integer multiplication algorithm with a claimed complexity of David Harvey, Joris Van Der Hoeven (2019). Integer multiplication in time O(n log n)\n\nProducts of measurements\n\nOne can only meaningfully add or subtract quantities of the same type but can multiply or divide quantities of different types. Four bags with three marbles each can be thought of as:\n[4 bags] \u00d7 [3 marbles per bag] = 12 marbles.\n\nWhen two measurements are multiplied together the product is of a type depending on the types of the measurements. The general theory is given by dimensional analysis. This analysis is routinely applied in physics but has also found applications in finance.\n\nA common example is multiplying speed by time gives distance, so\n50 kilometers per hour \u00d7 3 hours = 150 kilometers.\nIn this case, the hour units cancel out and we are left with only kilometer units.\n\nOther examples:\n2.5 meters \u00d7 4.5 meters = 11.25 square meters\n11 meters/seconds \u00d7 9 seconds = 99 meters\n4.5 residents per house \u00d7 20 houses = 90 residents\n\nProducts of sequences\nCapital Pi notation\nThe product of a sequence of terms can be written with the product symbol, which derives from the capital letter \u03a0 (Pi) in the Greek alphabet. Unicode position U+220F (\u220f) contains a glyph for denoting such a product, distinct from U+03A0 (\u03a0), the letter. The meaning of this notation is given by:\n\nthat is\n\nThe subscript gives the symbol for a dummy variable (i in this case), called the \"index of multiplication\" together with its lower bound (1), whereas the superscript (here 4) gives its upper bound. The lower and upper bound are expressions denoting integers. The factors of the product are obtained by taking the expression following the product operator, with successive integer values substituted for the index of multiplication, starting from the lower bound and incremented by 1 up to and including the upper bound. So, for example:\n\nMore generally, the notation is defined as\n\nwhere m and n are integers or expressions that evaluate to integers. In case , the value of the product is the same as that of the single factor xm. If , the product is the empty product, with the value\u00a01.\n\nInfinite products\n\nOne may also consider products of infinitely many terms; these are called infinite products. Notationally, we would replace n above by the lemniscate \u221e. The product of such a series is defined as the limit of the product of the first n terms, as n grows without bound. That is, by definition,\n\nOne can similarly replace m with negative infinity, and define:\n\nprovided both limits exist.\n\nProperties\nthumb|right|Multiplication of numbers 0\u201310. Line labels = multiplicand. X axis = multiplier. Y axis = product.Extension of this pattern into other quadrants gives the reason why a negative number times a negative number yields a positive number.Note also how multiplication by zero causes a reduction in dimensionality, as does multiplication by a singular matrix where the determinant is 0. In this process, information is lost and cannot be regained.\nFor the real and complex numbers, which includes for example natural numbers, integers, and fractions, multiplication has certain properties:\n\nCommutative property\nThe order in which two numbers are multiplied does not matter:\n\nAssociative property\nExpressions solely involving multiplication or addition are invariant with respect to order of operations:\n\nDistributive property\nHolds with respect to multiplication over addition. This identity is of prime importance in simplifying algebraic expressions:\n\nIdentity element\nThe multiplicative identity is 1; anything multiplied by 1 is itself. This feature of 1 is known as the identity property:\n\nProperty of 0\nAny number multiplied by 0 is 0. This is known as the zero property of multiplication:\n\nNegation\n\u22121 times any number is equal to the additive inverse of that number.\n where \n\n\u20131 times \u20131 is 1.\n\nInverse element\nEvery number x, except 0, has a multiplicative inverse, , such that .\n\nOrder preservation\nMultiplication by a positive number preserves order:\nFor , if  then .\nMultiplication by a negative number reverses order:\nFor , if  then .\nThe complex numbers do not have an ordering.\n\nOther mathematical systems that include a multiplication operation may not have all these properties. For example, multiplication is not, in general, commutative for matrices and quaternions.\n\nAxioms\n\nIn the book Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita, Giuseppe Peano proposed axioms for arithmetic based on his axioms for natural numbers. Peano arithmetic has two axioms for multiplication:\n\nHere S(y) represents the successor of y, or the natural number that follows y. The various properties like associativity can be proved from these and the other axioms of Peano arithmetic including induction. For instance S(0), denoted by 1, is a multiplicative identity because\n\nThe axioms for integers typically define them as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers. The model is based on treating (x,y) as equivalent to  when x and y are treated as integers. Thus both (0,1) and (1,2) are equivalent to \u22121. The multiplication axiom for integers defined this way is\n\nThe rule that \u22121 \u00d7 \u22121 = 1 can then be deduced from\n\nMultiplication is extended in a similar way to rational numbers and then to real numbers.\n\nMultiplication with set theory\nThe product of non-negative integers can be defined with set theory using cardinal numbers or the Peano axioms. See below how to extend this to multiplying arbitrary integers, and then arbitrary rational numbers. The product of real numbers is defined in terms of products of rational numbers, see construction of the real numbers.\n\nMultiplication in group theory\nThere are many sets that, under the operation of multiplication, satisfy the axioms that define group structure. These axioms are closure, associativity, and the inclusion of an identity element and inverses.\n\nA simple example is the set of non-zero rational numbers. Here we have identity 1, as opposed to groups under addition where the identity is typically 0. Note that with the rationals, we must exclude zero because, under multiplication, it does not have an inverse: there is no rational number that can be multiplied by zero to result in 1. In this example we have an abelian group, but that is not always the case.\n\nTo see this, look at the set of invertible square matrices of a given dimension, over a given field. Now it is straightforward to verify closure, associativity, and inclusion of identity (the identity matrix) and inverses. However, matrix multiplication is not commutative, therefore this group is nonabelian.\n\nAnother fact of note is that the integers under multiplication is not a group, even if we exclude zero. This is easily seen by the nonexistence of an inverse for all elements other than 1 and\u00a0\u22121.\n\nMultiplication in group theory is typically notated either by a dot, or by juxtaposition (the omission of an operation symbol between elements). So multiplying element a by element b could be notated a  b or ab.  When referring to a group via the indication of the set and operation, the dot is used, e.g., our first example could be indicated by \n\nMultiplication of different kinds of numbers\nNumbers can count (3\u00a0apples), order (the 3rd\u00a0apple), or measure (3.5\u00a0feet high); as the history of mathematics has progressed from counting on our fingers to modelling quantum mechanics, multiplication has been generalized to more complicated and abstract types of numbers, and to things that are not numbers (such as matrices) or do not look much like numbers (such as quaternions).\n\nIntegers\n is the sum of N copies of M when N and M are positive whole numbers. This gives the number of things in an array N wide and M high. Generalization to negative numbers can be done by\n and\n\nThe same sign rules apply to rational and real numbers.\n\nRational numbers\nGeneralization to fractions  is by multiplying the numerators and denominators respectively: . This gives the area of a rectangle  high and  wide, and is the same as the number of things in an array when the rational numbers happen to be whole numbers.\n\nReal numbers\nReal numbers and their products can be defined in terms of sequences of rational numbers.\n\nComplex numbers\nConsidering complex numbers  and  as ordered pairs of real numbers  and , the product  is . This is the same as for reals, , when the imaginary parts  and  are zero.\n\nEquivalently, denoting  as , we have \n\nFurther generalizations\nSee Multiplication in group theory, above, and Multiplicative group, which for example includes matrix multiplication. A very general, and abstract, concept of multiplication is as the \"multiplicatively denoted\" (second) binary operation in a ring. An example of a ring that is not any of the above number systems is a polynomial ring (you can add and multiply polynomials, but polynomials are not numbers in any usual sense.)\n\nDivision\nOften division, , is the same as multiplication by an inverse, . Multiplication for some types of \"numbers\" may have corresponding division, without inverses; in an integral domain x may have no inverse \"\" but  may be defined. In a division ring there are inverses, but  may be ambiguous in non-commutative rings since  need not be the same as .\n\nExponentiation\n\nWhen multiplication is repeated, the resulting operation is known as exponentiation. For instance, the product of three factors of two (2\u00d72\u00d72) is \"two raised to the third power\", and is denoted by 23, a two with a superscript three.

{"title": "Natural number", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number", "text": "right|thumb|Natural numbers can be used for counting (one apple, two apples, three apples, \u2026)\n\nIn mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in \"there are six coins on the table\") and ordering (as in \"this is the third largest city in the country\"). In common mathematical terminology, words colloquially used for counting are \"cardinal numbers\" and words connected to ordering represent \"ordinal numbers\". The natural numbers can, at times, appear as a convenient set of codes (labels or \"names\"); that is, as what linguists call nominal numbers, foregoing many or all of the properties of being a number in a mathematical sense.\n\nSome definitions, including the standard ISO 80000-2, begin the natural numbers with , corresponding to the non-negative integers , whereas others start with 1, corresponding to the positive integers . says: \"\u2115 is the set of natural numbers (positive integers)\" (p. 3) include zero in the natural numbers: 'Intuitively, the set  of all natural numbers may be described as follows:  contains an \"initial\" number 0; ...'. They follow that with their version of the Peano Postulates. (p. 15) Texts that exclude zero from the natural numbers sometimes refer to the natural numbers together with zero as the whole numbers, but in other writings, that term is used instead for the integers (including negative integers).\n\nThe natural numbers are a basis from which many other number sets may be built by extension: the integers (Grothendieck group), by including (if not yet in) the neutral element 0 and an additive inverse (\u2212n) for each nonzero natural number n; the rational numbers, by including a multiplicative inverse (1/n) for each nonzero integer n (and also the product of these inverses by integers); the real numbers by including with the rationals the limits of (converging) Cauchy sequences of rationals; the complex numbers, by including with the real numbers the unresolved square root of minus one (and also the sums and products thereof); and so on. says: \"The whole fantastic hierarchy of number systems is built up by purely set-theoretic means from a few simple assumptions about natural numbers.\" (Preface, p. x): \"Numbers make up the foundation of mathematics.\" (p. 1) These chains of extensions make the natural numbers canonically embedded (identified) in the other number systems.\n\nProperties of the natural numbers, such as divisibility and the distribution of prime numbers, are studied in number theory. Problems concerning counting and ordering, such as partitioning and enumerations, are studied in combinatorics.\n\nIn common language, for example in primary school, natural numbers may be called counting numbers both to intuitively exclude the negative integers and zero, and also to contrast the discreteness of counting to the continuity of measurement, established by the real numbers.\n\nHistory\n\nAncient roots\nthumb|upright|The Ishango bone (on exhibition at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences)Flash presentation, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Brussels, Belgium.The Ishango Bone, Democratic Republic of the Congo, on permanent display at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Brussels, Belgium. UNESCO's Portal to the Heritage of Astronomy is believed to have been used 20,000 years ago for natural number arithmetic.\n\nThe most primitive method of representing a natural number is to put down a mark for each object. Later, a set of objects could be tested for equality, excess or shortage, by striking out a mark and removing an object from the set.\n\nThe first major advance in abstraction was the use of numerals to represent numbers. This allowed systems to be developed for recording large numbers. The ancient Egyptians developed a powerful system of numerals with distinct hieroglyphs for\u00a01, 10, and all the powers of\u00a010 up to over 1\u00a0million. A stone carving from Karnak, dating from around 1500\u00a0BC and now at the Louvre in Paris, depicts\u00a0276 as 2\u00a0hundreds, 7\u00a0tens, and 6\u00a0ones; and similarly for the number\u00a04,622. The Babylonians had a place-value system based essentially on the numerals for\u00a01 and\u00a010, using base sixty, so that the symbol for sixty was the same as the symbol for one, its value being determined from context.Georges Ifrah, The Universal History of Numbers, Wiley, 2000, \n\nA much later advance was the development of the idea that\u00a0 can be considered as a number, with its own numeral. The use of a\u00a00 digit in place-value notation (within other numbers) dates back as early as 700\u00a0BC by the Babylonians, but they omitted such a digit when it would have been the last symbol in the number. The Olmec and Maya civilizations used\u00a00 as a separate number as early as the , but this usage did not spread beyond Mesoamerica... The use of a numeral\u00a00 in modern times originated with the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta in 628. However, 0 had been used as a number in the medieval computus (the calculation of the date of Easter), beginning with Dionysius Exiguus in 525, without being denoted by a numeral (standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for\u00a00); instead nulla (or the genitive form nullae) from nullus, the Latin word for \"none\", was employed to denote a\u00a00 value.\n\nThe first systematic study of numbers as abstractions is usually credited to the Greek philosophers Pythagoras and Archimedes. Some Greek mathematicians treated the number\u00a01 differently than larger numbers, sometimes even not as a number at all.This convention is used, for example, in Euclid's Elements, see Book VII, definitions 1 and 2.\n\nIndependent studies also occurred at around the same time in India, China, and Mesoamerica.Morris Kline, Mathematical Thought From Ancient to Modern Times, Oxford University Press, 1990 [1972], \n\nModern definitions\nIn 19th century Europe, there was mathematical and philosophical discussion about the exact nature of the natural numbers. A school of Naturalism stated that the natural numbers were a direct consequence of the human psyche. Henri Poincar\u00e9 was one of its advocates, as was Leopold Kronecker who summarized \"God made the integers, all else is the work of man\".The English translation is from Gray. In a footnote, Gray attributes the German quote to: \"Weber 1891/92, 19, quoting from a lecture of Kronecker's of 1886.\"\nWeber, Heinrich L. 1891-2. Kronecker. Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung 2:5\u201323. (The quote is on p. 19.)\n\nIn opposition to the Naturalists, the constructivists saw a need to improve the logical rigor in the foundations of mathematics.\"Much of the mathematical work of the twentieth century has been devoted to examining the logical foundations and structure of the subject.\"  In the 1860s, Hermann Grassmann suggested a recursive definition for natural numbers thus stating they were not really natural but a consequence of definitions. Later, two classes of such formal definitions were constructed; later, they were shown to be equivalent in most practical applications.\n\nSet-theoretical definitions of natural numbers were initiated by Frege and he initially defined a natural number as the class of all sets that are in one-to-one correspondence with a particular set, but this definition turned out to lead to paradoxes including Russell's paradox. Therefore, this formalism was modified so that a natural number is defined as a particular set, and any set that can be put into one-to-one correspondence with that set is said to have that number of elements.\n\nThe second class of definitions was introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce, refined by Richard Dedekind, and further explored by Giuseppe Peano; this approach is now called Peano arithmetic. It is based on an axiomatization of the properties of ordinal numbers: each natural number has a successor and every non-zero natural number has a unique predecessor. Peano arithmetic is equiconsistent with several weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Theorems that can be proved in ZFC but cannot be proved using the Peano Axioms include Goodstein's theorem.L. Kirby; J. Paris, Accessible Independence Results for Peano Arithmetic, Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society 14 (4): 285. , 1982.\n\nWith all these definitions it is convenient to include\u00a00 (corresponding to the empty set) as a natural number. Including\u00a00 is now the common convention among set theorists and logicians. Other mathematicians also include\u00a00, e.g., Computer languages often start from zero when enumerating items like loop counters and string- or array-elements. Many mathematicians have kept the older tradition and take\u00a01 to be the first natural number.This is common in texts about Real analysis. See, for example,  or .\n\nSince different properties are customarily associated to the tokens  and , e.g., neutral elements for addition and multiplications, respectively, it is important to know which version of natural numbers, generically denoted by  is employed in the case under consideration. This can be done by explanation in prose, by explicitly writing down the set, or by qualifying the generic identifier with a super- or subscript (see also in #Notation), e.g., like this:\n Naturals with zero: \n Naturals without zero: \n\nNotation\nright|thumb|upright|The double-struck capital N symbol, often used to denote the set of all natural numbers (see List of mathematical symbols).\nMathematicians use N or  (an N in blackboard bold) to refer to the set of all natural numbers. Older texts have also occasionally employed J as the symbol for this set.\n\nTo be unambiguous about whether 0 is included or not, sometimes a subscript (or superscript) \"0\" is added in the former case, and a superscript \"\" or subscript \"\" is added in the latter case:\n\n.\n\nAlternatively, since natural numbers naturally embed in the integers, they may be referred to as the positive, or the non-negative integers, respectively.\n\nProperties\n\nInfinity\nThe set of natural numbers is an infinite set. This kind of infinity is, by definition, called countable infinity. All sets that can be put into a bijective relation to the natural numbers are said to have this kind of infinity. This is also expressed by saying that the cardinal number of the set is aleph-naught ().\n\nAddition\nOne can recursively define an addition operator on the natural numbers by setting  and  for all , . Here  should be read as \"successor\". This turns the natural numbers  into a commutative monoid with identity element\u00a00, the so-called free object with one generator. This monoid satisfies the cancellation property and can be embedded in a group (in the mathematical sense of the word group). The smallest group containing the natural numbers is the integers.\n\nIf 1 is defined as , then . That is,  is simply the successor of .\n\nMultiplication\nAnalogously, given that addition has been defined, a multiplication operator \u00d7 can be defined via  and . This turns  into a free commutative monoid with identity element\u00a01; a generator set for this monoid is the set of prime numbers.\n\nRelationship between addition and multiplication\nAddition and multiplication are compatible, which is expressed in the distribution law: . These properties of addition and multiplication make the natural numbers an instance of a commutative semiring. Semirings are an algebraic generalization of the natural numbers where multiplication is not necessarily commutative. The lack of additive inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that  is not closed under subtraction (i.e., subtracting one natural from another does not always result in another natural), means that  is not a ring; instead it is a semiring (also known as a rig).\n\nIf the natural numbers are taken as \"excluding 0\", and \"starting at 1\", the definitions of + and \u00d7 are as above, except that they begin with  and .\n\nOrder\nIn this section, juxtaposed variables such as  indicate the product , and the standard order of operations is assumed.\n\nA total order on the natural numbers is defined by letting  if and only if there exists another natural number  where . This order is compatible with the arithmetical operations in the following sense: if ,  and  are natural numbers and , then  and .\n\nAn important property of the natural numbers is that they are well-ordered: every non-empty set of natural numbers has a least element. The rank among well-ordered sets is expressed by an ordinal number; for the natural numbers, this is denoted as  (omega).\n\nDivision\nIn this section, juxtaposed variables such as  indicate the product , and the standard order of operations is assumed.\n\nWhile it is in general not possible to divide one natural number by another and get a natural number as result, the procedure of division with remainder is available as a substitute: for any two natural numbers  and  with  there are natural numbers  and  such that\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\n\nThe number  is called the quotient and  is called the remainder of the division of  by\u00a0. The numbers  and  are uniquely determined by  and\u00a0. This Euclidean division is key to several other properties (divisibility), algorithms (such as the Euclidean algorithm), and ideas in number theory.\n\nAlgebraic properties satisfied by the natural numbers\nThe addition (+) and multiplication (\u00d7) operations on natural numbers as defined above have several algebraic properties:\n Closure under addition and multiplication: for all natural numbers  and , both  and  are natural numbers.\n Associativity: for all natural numbers , , and ,  and .\n Commutativity: for all natural numbers  and ,  and .\n Existence of identity elements: for every natural number a,  and .\n Distributivity of multiplication over addition for all natural numbers , , and , .\n No nonzero zero divisors: if  and  are natural numbers such that , then  or  (or both).\n\nGeneralizations\nTwo important generalizations of natural numbers arise from the two uses of counting and ordering: cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers.\n A natural number can be used to express the size of a finite set; more precisely, a cardinal number is a measure for the size of a set, which is even suitable for infinite sets. This concept of \"size\" relies on maps between sets, such that two sets have the same size, exactly if there exists a bijection between them. The set of natural numbers itself, and any bijective image of it, is said to be countably infinite and to have cardinality aleph-null ().\n Natural numbers are also used as linguistic ordinal numbers: \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", and so forth. This way they can be assigned to the elements of a totally ordered finite set, and also to the elements of any well-ordered countably infinite set. This assignment can be generalized to general well-orderings with a cardinality beyond countability, to yield the ordinal numbers. An ordinal number may also be used to describe the notion of \"size\" for a well-ordered set, in a sense different from cardinality: if there is an order isomorphism (more than a bijection!) between two well-ordered sets, they have the same ordinal number. The first ordinal number that is not a natural number is expressed as ; this is also the ordinal number of the set of natural numbers itself.\n\nMany well-ordered sets with cardinal number  have an ordinal number greater than  (the latter is the lowest possible). The least ordinal of cardinality  (i.e., the initial ordinal) is .\n\nFor finite well-ordered sets, there is a one-to-one correspondence between ordinal and cardinal numbers; therefore they can both be expressed by the same natural number, the number of elements of the set. This number can also be used to describe the position of an element in a larger finite, or an infinite, sequence.\n\nA countable non-standard model of arithmetic satisfying the Peano Arithmetic (i.e., the first-order Peano axioms) was developed by Skolem in 1933.  The hypernatural numbers are an uncountable model that can be constructed from the ordinary natural numbers via the ultrapower construction.\n\nGeorges Reeb used to claim provocatively that The na\u00efve integers don't fill up . Other generalizations are discussed in the article on numbers.\n\nFormal definitions\n\nPeano axioms\n\nMany properties of the natural numbers can be derived from the five Peano axioms: calls them \"Peano's Postulates\" and begins with \"1.0 is a natural number.\" (p. 117f)\n uses the language of set theory instead of the language of arithmetic for his five axioms. He begins with \"(I) (where, of course, \" ( is the set of all natural numbers). (p. 46)\n gives \"a two-part axiom\" in which the natural numbers begin with 1. (Section 10.1: An Axiomatization for the System of Positive Integers)\n\n 0 is a natural number.\n Every natural number has a successor.\n 0 is not the successor of any natural number.\n If the successor of  equals the successor of , then  equals .\n The axiom of induction: If a statement is true of 0, and if the truth of that statement for a number implies its truth for the successor of that number, then the statement is true for every natural number.\n\nThese are not the original axioms published by Peano, but are named in his honor.  Some forms of the Peano axioms have 1 in place of 0.  In ordinary arithmetic, the successor of  is . Replacing axiom 5 by an axiom schema, one obtains a (weaker) first-order theory called Peano arithmetic.\n\nConstructions based on set theory\n\nVon Neumann ordinals\n\nIn the area of mathematics called set theory, a specific construction due to John von Neumann attributes the idea to unpublished work of Zermelo in 1916 and several papers by von Neumann the 1920s. defines the natural numbers as follows:\n Set , the empty set,\n Define  for every set .  is the successor of , and  is called the successor function.\n By the axiom of infinity, there exists a set which contains 0 and is closed under the successor function. Such sets are said to be  'inductive'. The intersection of all such inductive sets is defined to be the set of natural numbers. It can be checked that the set of natural numbers satisfies the Peano axioms.\n It follows that each natural number is equal to the set of all natural numbers less than it:\n,\n,\n,\n,\n, etc.\n\nWith this definition, a natural number  is a particular set with  elements, and  if and only if  is a subset of . The standard definition, now called definition of von Neumann ordinals, is: \"each ordinal is the well-ordered set of all smaller ordinals.\"\n\nAlso, with this definition, different possible interpretations of notations like  (-tuples versus mappings of  into ) coincide.\n\nEven if one does not accept the axiom of infinity and therefore cannot accept that the set of all natural numbers exists, it is still possible to define any one of these sets.\n\nZermelo ordinals\n\nAlthough the standard construction is useful, it is not the only possible construction. Ernst Zermelo's construction goes as follows:\n Set \n Define ,\n It then follows that\n,\n,\n,\n, etc.\nEach natural number is then equal to the set containing just the natural number preceding it.

{"title": "Non-standard model of arithmetic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_model_of_arithmetic", "text": "In mathematical logic, a non-standard model of arithmetic is a model of (first-order) Peano arithmetic that contains non-standard numbers.  The term standard model of arithmetic refers to the standard natural numbers 0, 1, 2, \u2026.  The elements of any model of Peano arithmetic are linearly ordered and possess an initial segment isomorphic to the standard natural numbers. A non-standard model is one that has additional elements outside this initial segment.  The construction of such models is due to Thoralf Skolem (1934).\n\n Existence \n\nThere are several methods that can be used to prove the existence of non-standard models of arithmetic.\n\n From the compactness theorem \n\nThe existence of non-standard models of arithmetic can be demonstrated by an application of the compactness theorem.  To do this, a set of axioms P* is defined in a language including the language of Peano arithmetic together with a new constant symbol x. The axioms consist of the axioms of Peano arithmetic P together with another infinite set of axioms: for each numeral n, the axiom x > n is included. Any finite subset of these axioms is satisfied by a model that is the standard model of arithmetic plus the constant x interpreted as some number larger than any numeral mentioned in the finite subset of P*. Thus by the compactness theorem there is a model satisfying all the axioms P*. Since any model of P* is a model of P (since a model of a set of axioms is obviously also a model of any subset of that set of axioms), we have that our extended model is also a model of the Peano axioms. The element of this model corresponding to x cannot be a standard number, because as indicated it is larger than any standard number.\n\nUsing more complex methods, it is possible to build non-standard models that possess more complicated properties. For example, there are models of Peano arithmetic in which Goodstein's theorem fails. It can be proved in Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory that Goodstein's theorem holds in the standard model, so a model where Goodstein's theorem fails must be non-standard.\n\n From the incompleteness theorems \n\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems also imply the existence of non-standard models of arithmetic.\nThe incompleteness theorems show that a particular sentence G, the G\u00f6del sentence of Peano arithmetic, is not provable nor disprovable in Peano arithmetic. By the completeness theorem, this means that G is false in some model of Peano arithmetic. However, G is true in the standard model of arithmetic, and therefore any model in which G is false must be a non-standard model. Thus satisfying ~G is a sufficient condition for a model to be nonstandard. It is not a necessary condition, however; for any G\u00f6del sentence G, there are models of arithmetic with G true of all cardinalities.\n\nArithmetic unsoundness for models with ~G true\n\nAssuming that arithmetic is consistent, arithmetic with ~G is also consistent. However, since ~G means that arithmetic is inconsistent, the result will not be \u03c9-consistent (because ~G is false and this violates \u03c9-consistency).\n\n From an ultraproduct \n\nAnother method for constructing a non-standard model of arithmetic is via an ultraproduct. A typical construction uses the set of all sequences of natural numbers, .  Identify two sequences if they agree almost everywhere. The resulting semiring is a non-standard model of arithmetic.  It can be identified with the hypernatural numbers.\n\n Structure of countable non-standard models \n\nThe  ultraproduct models are uncountable.  One way to see this is to construct an injection of the infinite product of N into the ultraproduct. However, by the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem there must exist countable non-standard models of arithmetic. One way to define such a model is to use Henkin semantics.\n\nAny countable non-standard model of arithmetic has order type , where \u03c9 is the order type of the standard natural numbers, \u03c9* is the dual order (an infinite decreasing sequence) and \u03b7 is the order type of the rational numbers.  In other words, a countable non-standard model begins with an infinite increasing sequence (the standard elements of the model). This is followed by a collection of \"blocks,\" each of order type , the order type of the integers. These blocks are in turn densely ordered with the order type of the rationals. The result follows fairly easily because it is easy to see that the blocks of non-standard numbers have to be dense and linearly ordered without endpoints, and the order type of the rationals is the only countable dense linear order without endpoints.Andrey Bovykin and Richard Kaye Order-types of models of Peano arithmetic: a short survey June 14, 2001Andrey Bovykin On order-types of models of arithmetic thesis submitted to the University of Birmingham for the degree of Ph.D. in the Faculty of Science 13 April 2000Fred Landman LINEAR ORDERS, DISCRETE, DENSE, AND CONTINUOUS \u2013 includes proof that Q is the only countable dense linear order.\n\nSo, the order type of the countable non-standard models is known. However, the arithmetical operations are much more complicated.\n\nIt is easy to see that the arithmetical structure differs from . For instance if a nonstandard (non-finite) element u is in the model, then so is  for any m, n in the initial segment N, yet u2 is larger than  for any standard finite m.\n\nAlso one can define \"square roots\" such as the least v such that .  These cannot be within a standard finite number of any rational multiple of u. By analogous methods to non-standard analysis one can also use PA to define close approximations to irrational multiples of a non-standard number u such as the least v with  (these can be defined in PA using non-standard finite rational approximations of  even though pi itself cannot be). Once more,  has to be larger than any standard finite number for any standard finite m, n.     \n\nThis shows that the arithmetical structure of a countable non-standard model is more complex than the structure of the rationals. There is more to it than that though.\n\nTennenbaum's theorem shows that for any countable non-standard model of Peano arithmetic there is no way to code the elements of the model as (standard) natural numbers such that either the addition or multiplication operation of the model is a computable on the codes. This result was first obtained by Stanley Tennenbaum in 1959.\n\n References \n Citations \n\n Sources \n\n Boolos, G., and Jeffrey, R. 1974.

{"title": "PA degree", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA_degree", "text": "In the mathematical field of computability theory, a PA degree is a Turing degree that computes a complete extension of Peano arithmetic\u00a0(Jockusch\u00a01987). These degrees are closely related to fixed-point-free (DNR) functions, and have been thoroughly investigated in recursion theory.\n\n Background \n\nIn recursion theory,  denotes the computable function with index (program) e in some standard numbering of computable functions, and  denotes the eth computable function using a set B of natural numbers as an oracle.\n\nA set A of natural numbers is Turing reducible to a set B if there is a computable function that, given an oracle for set B, computes the characteristic function \u03c7A of the set A. That is,  there is an e such that . This relationship is denoted A \u2264T B; the relation \u2264T is a preorder.\n\nTwo sets of natural numbers are Turing equivalent if each is Turing reducible to the other. The notation A \u2261T B indicates A and B are Turing equivalent. The relation \u2261T is an equivalence relation known as Turing equivalence. A Turing degree is a collection of sets of natural numbers, such that any two sets in the collection are Turing equivalent. Equivalently, a Turing degree is an equivalence class of the relation \u2261T.\n\nThe Turing degrees are partially ordered by Turing reducibility. The notation a \u2264T b indicates there is a set in degree b that computes a set in degree a. Equivalently, a \u2264T b holds if and only if every set in b computes every set in a.\n\nA function f from the natural numbers to the natural numbers is said to be diagonally nonrecursive (DNR) if, for all n,  (here inequality holds by definition if  is undefined).  If the range of f is the set {0,1} then f is a DNR2 function. It is known that there are DNR functions that do not compute any DNR2 function.\n\n Completions of Peano arithmetic \n\nA completion of Peano arithmetic is a set of formulas in the language of Peano arithmetic, such that the set is consistent in first-order logic and such that, for each formula, either that formula or its negation is included in the set. Once a G\u00f6del numbering of the formulas in the language of PA has been fixed, it is possible to identify completions of PA with sets of natural numbers, and thus to speak about the computability of these completions.\n\nA Turing degree is defined to be a PA degree if there is a set of natural numbers in the degree that computes a completion of Peano Arithmetic. (This is equivalent to the proposition that every set in the degree computes a completion of PA.) Because there are no computable completions of PA, the degree 0 consisting of the computable sets of natural numbers is not a PA degree.\n\nBecause PA is an effective first-order theory, the completions of PA can be characterized as the infinite paths through a particular computable subtree of 2<\u03c9. Thus the PA degrees are exactly the degrees that compute an infinite path through this tree.\n\n Properties \n\nThe PA degrees are upward closed in the Turing degrees: if a is a PA degree and a \u2264T b then b is a PA degree.\n\nThe Turing degree 0\u2018, which is the degree of the halting problem, is a PA degree. There are also PA degrees that are not above 0\u2018. For example, the low basis theorem implies that there is a low PA degree.  On the other hand, Anton\u00edn Ku\u010dera has proved that there is a degree less than 0\u2018 that computes a DNR function but is not a PA degree (Jockusch\u00a01989:197).\n\nCarl Jockusch and Robert Soare\u00a0(1972) proved that the PA degrees are exactly the degrees of DNR2 functions.\n\nBy definition, a degree is PA if and only if it computes a path through the tree of completions of Peano arithmetic.

{"title": "Paragraph", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph", "text": "A paragraph (from the Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 paragraphos, \"to write beside\" or \"written beside\") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.\n\nHistory\n\nThe oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group. The Greek paragraphos evolved into the pilcrow (\u00b6), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The hedera leaf (e.g. \u2619) has also been used in the same way.\nthumb|Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US Constitution\n\nIn ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences into paragraphs was a line break (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.\nModern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph whitespace, or put in the indentation space.\n\nA second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to create \"block paragraphs.\" On a typewriter, a double carriage return produces a blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters (or word processing software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading. This style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the World Wide Web and email.\n\nTypographical considerations\n\nWidows and orphans occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last line in a column or page, or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page.\n\nProfessionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should \"Set opening paragraphs flush left.\" Bringhurst explains as follows:\n\nThe function of a paragraph is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.\n\nThe Elements of Typographic Style states that \"at least one en [space]\" should be used to indent paragraphs after the first, noting that that is the \"practical minimum\". An em space is the most commonly used paragraph indent. Miles Tinker, in his book Legibility of Print, concluded that indenting the first line of paragraphs increases readability by 7%, on the average.\n\nIn computing\n\nIn word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph.\nThis distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks.  The software may apply vertical whitespace or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.\n\nHow such documents are actually stored depends on the file format.  For example, HTML uses the <p> tag as a paragraph container.  In plaintext files, there are two common formats.  Pre-formatted text will have a newline at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line.  An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.\n\nA line break that is inserted manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be distinct from a paragraph break, although this is typically not done in prose. HTML's <br\u00a0/> tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the W3C recommends using it only to separate lines of verse (where each \"paragraph\" is a stanza), or in a street address.\n\nNumbering\n\nParagraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system, where (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 A Course of Modern Analysis, chapter 9 is devoted to Fourier Series; within that chapter \u00a79.6 introduces Riemann's theory, the following section \u00a79.61 treats an associated function, following \u00a79.62 some properties of that function, following \u00a79.621 a related lemma, while \u00a79.63 introduces Riemann's main theorem, and so on. Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of numbering to Giuseppe Peano on their \"Contents\" page, although this attribution does not seem to be widely credited elsewhere.\n\n Section breaks \n\nMany published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time. This extra space, especially when co-occurring at a page or section break, may contain an asterisk, three asterisks, a special stylistic dingbat, or a special symbol known as an asterism.\n\nStyle advice\n\nThe crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate.  The form varies among different types of writing.  For example, newspapers, scientific journals, and fictional essays have somewhat different conventions for the placement of paragraph breaks.\n\nA common English usage misconception is that a paragraph has three to five sentences; single-word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing, and journalists often use single-sentence paragraphs.\n\nEnglish students are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have a topic sentence or \"main idea\", preferably first, and multiple \"supporting\" or \"detail\" sentences which explain or supply evidence.  One technique of this type, intended for essay writing, is known as the Schaffer paragraph.  This advice differs from stock advice for the construction of paragraphs in Japanese (translated as danraku \u6bb5\u843d).\n\nSee also\n Inverted pyramid (journalism)\n\n Notes \n\n References \nThe American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.  4th ed.

{"title": "Peano axioms", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms", "text": "In mathematical logic, the Peano axioms, also known as the Dedekind\u2013Peano axioms or the Peano postulates, are axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of metamathematical investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether number theory is consistent and complete.\n\nThe need to formalize arithmetic was not well appreciated until the work of Hermann Grassmann, who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the successor operation and induction. In 1881, Charles Sanders Peirce provided an axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic.,  In\u00a01888, Richard Dedekind proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in\u00a01889, Peano published a simplified version of them as a collection of axioms in his book, The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method ().\n\nThe Peano axioms contain three types of statements. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set of natural numbers. The next four are general statements about equality; in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the Peano axioms, but rather as axioms of the \"underlying logic\". The next three axioms are first-order statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final axiom is a second order statement of the principle of mathematical induction over the natural numbers. A weaker first-order system called Peano arithmetic is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the second-order induction axiom with a first-order axiom schema.\n\n Formulation \n\nWhen Peano formulated his axioms, the language of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for set membership (\u2208, which comes from Peano's \u03b5) and implication (\u2283, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the Begriffsschrift by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schr\u00f6der.\n\nThe Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of natural numbers, usually represented as a set N or  The non-logical symbols for the axioms consist of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol S.\n\nThe first axiom states that the constant 0 is a natural number:\n\nThe next four axioms describe the equality relation. Since they are logically valid in first-order logic with equality, they are not considered to be part of \"the Peano axioms\" in modern treatments.\n\nThe remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued \"successor\" function S.\n\nPeano's original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the \"first\" natural number. This choice is arbitrary, as axiom 1 does not endow the constant 0 with any additional properties. However, because 0 is the additive identity in arithmetic, most modern formulations of the Peano axioms start from 0. Axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 define a unary representation of the intuitive notion of natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as S(0), 2 as S(S(0)), etc. However, considering the notion of natural numbers as being defined by these axioms, axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 do not imply that the successor function generates all the natural numbers different from 0. Put differently, they do not guarantee that every natural number other than zero must succeed some other natural number.\n\nThe intuitive notion that each natural number can be obtained by applying successor sufficiently often to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the axiom of induction.\n\nThe induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form:\n\nIn Peano's original formulation, the induction axiom is a second-order axiom. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker first-order induction scheme. There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section  below.\n\n Arithmetic \n\nThe Peano axioms can be augmented with the operations of addition and multiplication and the usual total (linear) ordering on N. The respective functions and relations are constructed in set theory or second-order logic, and can be shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.\n\n Addition \n\nAddition is a function that maps two natural numbers (two elements of N) to another one. It is defined recursively as:\n\n \nFor example:\n\n \n\nThe structure  is a commutative monoid with identity element 0.  is also a cancellative magma, and thus embeddable in a group. The smallest group embedding N is the integers.\n\n Multiplication \n\nSimilarly, multiplication is a function mapping two natural numbers to another one. Given addition, it is defined recursively as:\n\n \nIt is easy to see that S(0) (or \"1\", in the familiar language of decimal representation) is the multiplicative right identity:\n\n a \u00b7 S(0) = a + (a \u00b7 0) = a + 0 = a\n\nTo show that S(0) is also the multiplicative left identity requires the induction axiom due to the way multiplication is defined:\n\n S(0) is the left identity of 0: S(0) \u00b7 0 = 0.\n If S(0) is the left identity of a (that is S(0) \u00b7 a = a), then S(0) is also the left identity of S(a): S(0) \u00b7 S(a) = S(0) + S(0) \u00b7 a = S(0) + a = a + S(0) = S(a + 0) = S(a).\n\nTherefore by the induction axiom S(0) is the multiplicative left identity of all natural numbers.  Moreover, it can be shown that multiplication distributes over addition:\n\n a \u00b7 (b + c) = (a \u00b7 b) + (a \u00b7 c).\n\nThus,  is a commutative semiring.\n\n Inequalities \n\nThe usual total order relation \u2264 on natural numbers can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number:\n\n For all ,  if and only if there exists some  such that .\n\nThis relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for , if , then:\n\n a + c \u2264 b + c, and\n a \u00b7 c \u2264 b \u00b7 c.\n\nThus, the structure  is an ordered semiring; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring.\n\nThe axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following form that uses a stronger hypothesis, making use of the order relation \"\u2264\":\n\n For any predicate \u03c6, if\n \u03c6(0) is true, and\n for every , if  implies that \u03c6(k) is true, then \u03c6(S(n)) is true,\n then for every , \u03c6(n) is true.\n\nThis form of the induction axiom, called strong induction, is a consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited for reasoning about the \u2264 order. For example, to show that the naturals are well-ordered\u2014every nonempty subset of N has a least element\u2014one can reason as follows. Let a nonempty  be given and assume X has no least element.\n\n Because 0 is the least element of N, it must be that .\n For any , suppose for every , . Then , for otherwise it would be the least element of X.\n\nThus, by the strong induction principle, for every , . Thus, , which contradicts X being a nonempty subset of N. Thus X has a least element.\n\n First-order theory of arithmetic \n\nAll of the Peano axioms except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), but it can be transformed into a first-order axiom schema of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom. The reason that it is weaker is that the number of predicates in first-order language is countable, whereas the number of sets of natural numbers is uncountable. Thus, there exist sets that cannot be described in first-order language (in fact, most sets have this property).\n\nFirst-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have another technical limitation. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.\n\nThe following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality), which contains six of the seven axioms of Robinson arithmetic, is sufficient for this purpose:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a countably infinite set of axioms. For each formula  in the language of Peano arithmetic, the first-order induction axiom for \u03c6 is the sentence\n\n \n\nwhere  is an abbreviation for y1,...,yk. The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom, that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula \u03c6.\n\n Equivalent axiomatizations \nThere are many different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, such as the one just described, use a signature that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of ordered semirings, including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.\n\n , i.e., addition is associative.\n , i.e., addition is commutative.\n , i.e., multiplication is associative.\n , i.e., multiplication is commutative.\n , i.e., multiplication distributes over addition.\n , i.e., zero is an identity for addition, and an absorbing element for multiplication (actually superfluous).\n , i.e., one is an identity for multiplication.\n , i.e., the '<' operator is transitive.\n , i.e., the '<' operator is irreflexive.\n , i.e., the ordering satisfies trichotomy.\n , i.e. the ordering is preserved under addition of the same element.\n , i.e. the ordering is preserved under multiplication by the same positive element.\n , i.e. given any two distinct elements, the larger is the smaller plus another element.\n , i.e. zero and one are distinct and there is no element between them.\n , i.e. zero is the minimum element.\n\nThe theory defined by these axioms is known as PA\u2212; the theory PA is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema. An important property of PA\u2212 is that any structure  satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by ) isomorphic to . Elements in that segment are called standard elements, while other elements are called nonstandard elements.\n\n Models \n\nA model of the Peano axioms is a triple , where N is a (necessarily infinite) set,  and  satisfies the axioms above. Dedekind proved in his 1888 book, The Nature and Meaning of Numbers (, i.e., \u201cWhat are the numbers and what are they good for?\u201d) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are isomorphic. In particular, given two models  and  of the Peano axioms, there is a unique homomorphism  satisfying\n\n \nand it is a bijection. This means that the second-order Peano axioms are categorical. This is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, however.\n\n Set-theoretic models \n\nThe Peano axioms can be derived from set theoretic constructions of the natural numbers and axioms of set theory such as ZF.,  The standard construction of the naturals, due to John von Neumann, starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, \u2205, and an operator s on sets defined as:\n\n \n\nThe set of natural numbers N is defined as the intersection of all sets closed under s that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it:\n\n \nand so on. The set N together with 0 and the successor function  satisfies the Peano axioms.\n\nPeano arithmetic is equiconsistent with several weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, existence of the empty set, and the axiom of adjunction), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.\n\n Interpretation in category theory \n\nThe Peano axioms can also be understood using category theory. Let C be a category with terminal object 1C, and define the category of pointed unary systems, US1(C) as follows:\n\n The objects of US1(C) are triples  where X is an object of C, and  and  are C-morphisms.\n A morphism \u03c6 : (X, 0X, SX) \u2192 (Y, 0Y, SY) is a C-morphism  with  and .\n\nThen C is said to satisfy the Dedekind\u2013Peano axioms if US1(C) has an initial object; this initial object is known as a natural number object in C. If  is this initial object, and  is any other object, then the unique map  is such that\n\n \nThis is precisely the recursive definition of 0X and SX.\n\n Nonstandard models \n\nAlthough the usual natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other models as well (called \"non-standard models\"); the compactness theorem implies that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.\n\nWhen interpreted as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.\n\nIt is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. The answer is affirmative as Skolem in 1933 provided an explicit  construction of such a nonstandard model.  On the other hand, Tennenbaum's theorem, proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is computable. This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. There is only one possible order type of a countable nonstandard model. Letting \u03c9 be the order type of the natural numbers, \u03b6 be the order type of the integers, and \u03b7 be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is , which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.\n\n Overspill \n\nA cut in a nonstandard model M is a nonempty subset I of M so that I is downward closed (x<y and y\u2208I implies x\u2208I) and I is closed under successor. A proper cut is a cut that is a proper subset of M. Each nonstandard model has many proper cuts, including one that corresponds to the standard natural numbers.   However, the induction scheme in Peano arithmetic prevents any proper cut from being definable.  The overspill lemma, first proved by Abraham Robinson, formalizes this fact. \n\nOverspill Lemma Let M be a nonstandard model of PA and let I be a proper cut of M. Suppose that  is a tuple of elements of M and  is a formula in the language of arithmetic so that\n for all b\u2208I.\nThen there is a c in M that is greater than every element of I such that\n\n Consistency \n\nWhen the Peano axioms were first proposed, Bertrand Russell and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a \"natural number\".An illustration of 'interpretation' is Russell's own definition of 'cardinal number'. The uninterpreted system in this case is Peano's axioms for the number system, whose three primitive ideas and five axioms, Peano believed, were sufficient to enable one to derive all the properties of the system of natural numbers. Actually, Russell maintains, Peano's axioms define any progression of the form  of which the series of the natural numbers is one instance. Henri Poincar\u00e9 was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were consistent; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything.So Poincar\u00e9 turned to see whether logicism could generate arithmetic, more precisely, the arithmetic of ordinals. Couturat, said Poincar\u00e9, had accepted the Peano axioms as a definition of a number. But this will not do. The axioms cannot be shown to be free of contradiction by finding examples of them, and any attempt to show that they were contradiction-free by examining the totality of their implications would require the very principle of mathematical induction Couturat believed they implied. For (in a further passage dropped from S&M) either one assumed the principle in order to prove it, which would only prove that if it is true it is not self-contradictory, which says nothing; or one used the principle in another form than the one stated, in which case one must show that the number of steps in one's reasoning was an integer according to the new definition, but this could not be done (1905c, 834). In 1900, David Hilbert posed the problem of proving their consistency using only finitistic methods as the second of his twenty-three problems. In 1931, Kurt G\u00f6del proved his second incompleteness theorem, which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.\n\nAlthough it is widely claimed that G\u00f6del's theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. G\u00f6del himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958, G\u00f6del published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using type theory. In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using transfinite induction up to an ordinal called \u03b50. Gentzen explained: \"The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles\". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal \u03b50 can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a Turing machine describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.\n\nThe vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano's axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as Gentzen's proof. A small number of philosophers and mathematicians, some of whom also advocate ultrafinitism, reject Peano's axioms because accepting the axioms amounts to accepting the infinite collection of natural numbers. In particular, addition (including the successor function) and multiplication are assumed to be total. Curiously, there are self-verifying theories that are similar to PA but have subtraction and division instead of addition and multiplication, which are axiomatized in such a way to avoid proving sentences that correspond to the totality of addition and multiplication, but which are still able to prove all true  theorems of PA, and yet can be extended to a consistent theory that proves its own consistency (stated as the non-existence of a Hilbert-style proof of \"0=1\").\n\n See also \n\n Foundations of mathematics\n Frege's theorem\n Goodstein's theorem\n Neo-logicism\n Non-standard model of arithmetic\n Paris\u2013Harrington theorem\n Presburger arithmetic\n Robinson arithmetic\n Second-order arithmetic\n Typographical Number Theory\n\n Notes \n\n References \n Citations \n\n Sources \n\n \n . \n Two English translations:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n Contains translations of the following two papers, with valuable commentary:\n \n \n\n Further reading \n \n\n External links \n\n Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \"Henri Poincar\u00e9\" by Mauro Murzi.

Peano's curve is a surjective, continuous function from the unit interval onto the unit square, however it is not injective. Peano was motivated by an earlier result of Georg Cantor that these two sets have the same cardinality. Because of this example, some authors use the phrase \"Peano curve\" to refer more generally to any space-filling curve..\n\nConstruction\nPeano's curve may be constructed by a sequence of steps, where the ith step constructs a set Si of squares, and a sequence Pi of the centers of the squares, from the set and sequence constructed in the previous step. As a base case, S0 consists of the single unit square, and P0 is the one-element sequence consisting of its center point.\n\nIn step i, each square s of Si\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 is partitioned into nine smaller equal squares, and its center point c is replaced by a contiguous subsequence of the centers of these nine smaller squares.\nThis subsequence is formed by grouping the nine smaller squares into three columns, ordering the centers contiguously within each column, and then ordering the columns from one side of the square to the other, in such a way that the distance between each consecutive pair of points in the subsequence equals the side length of the small squares. There are four such orderings possible:\nLeft three centers bottom to top, middle three centers top to bottom, and right three centers bottom to top\nRight three centers bottom to top, middle three centers top to bottom, and left three centers bottom to top\nLeft three centers top to bottom, middle three centers bottom to top, and right three centers top to bottom\nRight three centers top to bottom, middle three centers bottom to top, and left three centers top to bottom\nAmong these four orderings, the one for s is chosen in such a way that the distance between the first point of the ordering and its predecessor in Pi also equals the side length of the small squares. If c was the first point in its ordering, then the first of these four orderings is chosen for the nine centers that replace c..\n\nThe Peano curve itself is the limit of the curves through the sequences of square centers, as i goes to infinity.\n\nVariants\n200px|thumb|Peano curve with the middle line erased creates a Sierpinski carpet\n\nIn the definition of the Peano curve, it is possible to perform some or all of the steps by making the centers of each row of three squares be contiguous, rather than the centers of each column of squares. These choices lead to many different variants of the Peano curve.\n\nA \"multiple radix\" variant of this curve with different numbers of subdivisions in different directions can be used to fill rectangles of arbitrary shapes.\n\nThe Hilbert curve is a simpler variant of the same idea, based on subdividing squares into four equal smaller squares instead of into nine equal smaller squares.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Continuous mappings\nCategory:Fractal curves"}

{"title": "Presburger arithmetic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic", "text": "Presburger arithmetic is the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, named in honor of Moj\u017cesz Presburger, who introduced it in 1929. The signature of Presburger arithmetic contains only the addition operation and equality, omitting the multiplication operation entirely. The axioms include a schema of induction.\n\nPresburger arithmetic is much weaker than Peano arithmetic, which includes both addition and multiplication operations. Unlike Peano arithmetic, Presburger arithmetic is a decidable theory. This means it is possible to algorithmically determine, for any sentence in the language of Presburger arithmetic, whether that sentence is provable from the axioms of Presburger arithmetic. The asymptotic running-time computational complexity of this decision problem is at least doubly exponential, however, as shown by .\n\nOverview\nThe language of Presburger arithmetic contains constants 0 and 1 and a binary function +, interpreted as addition. In this language, the axioms of Presburger arithmetic are the universal closures of the following:\n \u00ac(0 = x + 1)\n x + 1 = y + 1 \u2192 x = y\n x + 0 = x\n x + (y + 1) = (x + y) + 1\n Let P(x) be a first-order formula in the language of Presburger arithmetic with a  free variable x (and possibly other free variables). Then the following formula is an axiom:\n(P(0) \u2227 \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 P(x + 1))) \u2192 \u2200y P(y).\n\n(5) is an axiom schema of induction, representing infinitely many axioms. Since the axioms in the schema in (5) cannot be replaced by any finite number of axioms, Presburger arithmetic is not finitely axiomatizable in first-order logic.\n\nPresburger arithmetic cannot formalize concepts such as divisibility or primality. Generally, any number concept leading to multiplication cannot be defined in Presburger arithmetic, since that leads to incompleteness and undecidability. However, it can formulate individual instances of divisibility; for example, it proves \"for all x, there exists y : (y + y = x) \u2228 (y + y + 1 = x)\". This states that every number is either even or odd.\n\nProperties\n\nMoj\u017cesz Presburger proved Presburger arithmetic to be:\n consistent: There is no statement in Presburger arithmetic which can be deduced from the axioms such that its negation can also be deduced.\n complete: For each statement in the language of Presburger arithmetic, either it is possible to deduce it from the axioms or it is possible to deduce its negation. \n decidable: There exists an algorithm which decides whether any given statement in Presburger arithmetic is a theorem or a nontheorem.\n\nThe decidability of Presburger arithmetic can be shown using quantifier elimination, supplemented by reasoning about arithmetical congruence (Enderton 2001, p.\u00a0188).\n\nPeano arithmetic, which is Presburger arithmetic augmented with multiplication, is not decidable, as a consequence of the negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. By G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem, Peano arithmetic is incomplete and its consistency is not internally provable (but see Gentzen's consistency proof).\n\nThe decision problem for Presburger arithmetic is an interesting example in computational complexity theory and computation. Let n be the length of a statement in Presburger arithmetic. Then Fischer and Rabin (1974) proved that any decision algorithm for Presburger arithmetic has a worst-case runtime of at least , for some constant c>0.  Hence, the decision problem for Presburger arithmetic is an example of a decision problem that has been proved to require more than exponential run time. Fischer and Rabin also proved that for any reasonable axiomatization (defined precisely in their paper), there exist theorems of length n which have doubly exponential length proofs. Intuitively, this means there are computational limits on what can be proven by computer programs. Fischer and Rabin's work also implies that Presburger arithmetic can be used to define formulas which correctly calculate any algorithm as long as the inputs are less than relatively large bounds. The bounds can be increased, but only by using new formulas. On the other hand, a triply exponential upper bound on a decision procedure for Presburger Arithmetic was proved by Oppen (1978). A more tight complexity bound was shown using alternating complexity classes by .\n\nThe set of true statements in Presburger arithmetic (PA) is complete for TimeAlternations(22nO(1), n).  Thus, its complexity is between double exponential nondeterministic time (2-NEXP) and double exponential space (2-EXPSPACE). Completeness is under polynomial time many-to-one reductions.  (Also, note that while Presburger arithmetic is commonly abbreviated PA, in mathematics in general PA usually means Peano arithmetic.)\n\nFor a more fine-grained result, let PA(i) be the set of true \u03a3i PA statements, and PA(i, j) the set of true \u03a3i PA statements with each quantifier block limited to j variables.  '<' is considered to be quantifier-free; here, bounded quantifiers are counted as quantifiers.\nPA(1, j) is in P, while PA(1) is NP-complete.\nFor i > 0 and j > 2, PA(i + 1, j) is \u03a3iP-complete. The hardness result only needs j>2 (as opposed to j=1) in the last quantifier block.\nFor i>0, PA(i+1) is \u03a3iEXP-complete (and is TimeAlternations(2nO(i), i)-complete). \n\nApplications\nBecause Presburger arithmetic is decidable,  automatic theorem provers for Presburger arithmetic exist. For example, the Coq proof assistant system features the tactic omega for Presburger arithmetic and the Isabelle proof assistant contains a verified quantifier elimination procedure by Nipkow (2010). The double exponential complexity of the theory makes it infeasible to use the theorem provers on complicated formulas, but this behavior occurs only in the presence of nested quantifiers: Oppen and Nelson (1980) describe an automatic theorem prover which uses the simplex algorithm on an extended Presburger arithmetic without nested quantifiers to prove some of the instances of quantifier-free Presburger arithmetic formulas. More recent satisfiability modulo theories solvers use complete integer programming techniques to handle quantifier-free fragment of Presburger arithmetic theory (King, Barrett, Tinelli 2014).\n\nPresburger arithmetic can be extended to include multiplication by constants, since multiplication is repeated addition. Most array subscript calculations then fall within the region of decidable problems.  This approach is the basis of at least five proof-of-correctness systems for computer programs, beginning with the Stanford Pascal Verifier in the late 1970s and continuing through to Microsoft's Spec# system of 2005.\n\nPresburger-definable integer relation\n\nSome properties are now given about integer relations definable in Presburger Arithmetic. For the sake of simplicity, all relations considered in this section are over natural integers.\n\nA relation is  Presburger-definable if and only if it is a semilinear set.\n\nA unary integer relation , that is, a set of natural integers, is Presburger-definable if and only if it is ultimately periodic. That is, if there exists a threshold  and a positive period  such that, for all integer  such that ,  if and only if .\n\nBy the Cobham\u2013Semenov theorem, a relation is Presburger-definable if and only if it is definable in B\u00fcchi arithmetic of base  for all . A relation definable in B\u00fcchi arithmetic of base  and  for  and  being multiplicatively independent integers is Presburger definable.\n\nAn integer relation  is Presburger-definable if and only if all sets of integers which are definable in first order logic with addition and  (that is, Presburger Arithmetic plus a predicate for ) are Presburger-definable. Equivalently, for each relation  which is not Presburger-definable, there exists a first-order formula with addition and  which defines a set of integers which is not definable using only addition.\n\nMuchnik's characterization\nPresburger-definable relations admit another characterization: by Muchnik's theorem. It is more complicated to state, but led to the proof of the two former characterizations. Before Muchnik's theorem can be stated, some additional definitions must be introduced.\n\nLet  be a set, the section  of , for  and  is defined as \n\nGiven two sets  and a -tuple of integers , the set  is called -periodic in  if, for all  such that  then  if and only if . For , the set   is said to be  -periodic in  if it is  -periodic for some  such that  \n\nFinally, for  let \n\n \n\ndenote the cube of size  whose lesser corner is .\n\nMuchnik's Theorem.  is Presburger-definable if and only if:\n if  then  all sections of  are Presburger-definable and \n there exists  such that, for every , there exists  such that for all  with \n\n is -periodic in .\n\nIntuitively, the integer  represents the length of a shift, the integer  is the size of the cubes and  is the threshold before the periodicity. This result remains true when the condition \n\n \n\nis replaced either by  or by .\n\nThis characterization led to the so-called \"definable criterion for definability in Presburger arithmetic\", that is: there exists a first-order formula with addition and a -ary predicate  which holds if and only if  is interpreted by a Presburger-definable relation. Muchnik's theorem also allows one to prove that it is decidable whether an automatic sequence accepts a Presburger-definable set.\n\nSee also\nRobinson arithmetic\n\nReferences\n\n Cooper, D.

{"title": "Proof theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory", "text": "Proof theory is a major branchAccording to Wang (1981), pp. 3\u20134, proof theory is one of four domains mathematical logic, together with model theory, axiomatic set theory, and recursion theory. Barwise (1978) consists of four corresponding parts, with part D being about \"Proof Theory and Contstructive Mathematics\". of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques.  Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system.  As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.\n\nSome of the major areas of proof theory include structural proof theory, ordinal analysis, provability logic, reverse mathematics, proof mining, automated theorem proving, and proof complexity. Much research also focuses on applications in computer science, linguistics, and philosophy.\n\nHistory\nAlthough the formalisation of logic was much advanced by the work of such figures as Gottlob Frege, Giuseppe Peano, Bertrand Russell, and Richard Dedekind, the story of modern proof theory is often seen as being established by David Hilbert, who initiated what is called Hilbert's program in the foundations of mathematics. The central idea of this program was that if we could give finitary proofs of consistency for all the sophisticated formal theories needed by mathematicians, then we could ground these theories by means of a metamathematical argument, which shows that all of their purely universal assertions (more technically their provable  sentences) are finitarily true; once so grounded we do not care about the non-finitary meaning of their existential theorems, regarding these as pseudo-meaningful stipulations of the existence of ideal entities.\n\nThe failure of the program was induced by Kurt G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, which showed that any \u03c9-consistent theory that is sufficiently strong to express certain simple arithmetic truths, cannot prove its own consistency, which on G\u00f6del's formulation is a   sentence. However, modified versions of Hilbert's program emerged and research has been carried out on related topics. This has led, in particular, to:\nRefinement of G\u00f6del's result, particularly J. Barkley Rosser's refinement, weakening the above requirement of \u03c9-consistency to simple consistency;\nAxiomatisation of the core of G\u00f6del's result in terms of a modal language, provability logic;\nTransfinite iteration of theories, due to Alan Turing and Solomon Feferman;\nThe discovery of self-verifying theories, systems strong enough to talk about themselves, but too weak to carry out the diagonal argument that is the key to G\u00f6del's unprovability argument.\n\nIn parallel to the rise and fall of Hilbert's program, the foundations of structural proof theory were being founded. Jan \u0141ukasiewicz  suggested in 1926 that one could improve on Hilbert systems as a basis for the axiomatic presentation of logic if one allowed the drawing of conclusions from assumptions in the inference rules of the logic.  In response to this, Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u015bkowski (1929) and Gerhard Gentzen (1934) independently provided such systems, called calculi of natural deduction, with Gentzen's approach introducing the idea of symmetry between the grounds for asserting propositions, expressed in introduction rules, and the consequences of accepting propositions in the elimination rules, an idea that has proved very important in proof theory..  Gentzen (1934) further introduced the idea of the sequent calculus, a calculus advanced in a similar spirit that better expressed the duality of the logical connectives,Girard, Lafont, and Taylor (1988). and went on to make fundamental advances in the formalisation of intuitionistic logic,  and provide the first combinatorial proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic.  Together, the presentation of natural deduction and the sequent calculus introduced the fundamental idea of analytic proof to proof theory.\n\nStructural proof theory\n\nStructural proof theory is the subdiscipline of proof theory that studies the specifics of proof calculi. The three most well-known styles of proof calculi are:\nThe Hilbert calculi\nThe natural deduction calculi\nThe sequent calculi\n\nEach of these can give a complete and axiomatic formalization of propositional or predicate logic of either the classical or intuitionistic flavour, almost any modal logic, and many substructural logics, such as relevance logic or linear logic.  Indeed, it is unusual to find a logic that resists being represented in one of these calculi.\n\nProof theorists are typically interested in proof calculi that support a notion of analytic proof.  The notion of analytic proof was introduced by Gentzen for the sequent calculus; there the analytic proofs are those that are cut-free. Much of the interest in cut-free proofs comes from the subformula property: every formula in the end sequent of a cut-free proof is a subformula of one of the premises. This allows one to show consistency of the sequent calculus easily; if the empty sequent were derivable it would have to be a subformula of some premise, which it is not. Gentzen's midsequent theorem, the Craig interpolation theorem, and Herbrand's theorem also follow as corollaries of the cut-elimination theorem.\n\nGentzen's natural deduction calculus also supports a notion of analytic proof, as shown by Dag Prawitz. The definition is slightly more complex: we say the analytic proofs are the normal forms, which are related to the notion of normal form in term rewriting.  More exotic proof calculi such as Jean-Yves Girard's proof nets also support a notion of analytic proof.\n\nStructural proof theory is connected to type theory by means of the Curry-Howard correspondence, which observes a structural analogy between the process of normalisation in the natural deduction calculus and beta reduction in the typed lambda calculus.  This provides the foundation for the intuitionistic type theory developed by Per Martin-L\u00f6f, and is often extended to a three way correspondence, the third leg of which are the cartesian closed categories.\n\nOther research topics in structural theory include analytic tableau, which apply the central idea of analytic proof from structural proof theory to provide decision procedures and semi-decision procedures for a wide range of logics, and the proof theory of substructural logics.\n\nOrdinal analysis\n\nOrdinal analysis is a powerful technique for providing combinatorial consistency proofs for subsystems of arithmetic, analysis, and set theory. G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem is often interpreted as demonstrating that finitistic consistency proofs are impossible for theories of sufficient strength. Ordinal analysis allows one to measure precisely the infinitary content of the consistency of theories. For a consistent recursively axiomatized theory T, one can prove in finitistic arithmetic that the well-foundedness of a certain transfinite ordinal implies the consistency of T. G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem implies that the well-foundedness of such an ordinal cannot be proved in the theory T.\n\nConsequences of ordinal analysis include (1) consistency of subsystems of classical second order arithmetic and set theory relative to constructive theories, (2) combinatorial independence results, and (3) classifications of provably total recursive functions and provably well-founded ordinals.\n\nOrdinal analysis was originated by Gentzen, who proved the consistency of Peano Arithmetic using transfinite induction up to ordinal \u03b50. Ordinal analysis has been extended to many fragments of first and second order arithmetic and set theory. One major challenge has been the ordinal analysis of impredicative theories. The first breakthrough in this direction was Takeuti's proof of the consistency of \u03a0-CA0 using the method of ordinal diagrams.\n\nProvability logic\n\nProvability logic is a modal logic, in which the box operator is interpreted as 'it is provable that'. The point is to capture the notion of a proof predicate of a reasonably rich formal theory. As basic axioms of the provability logic GL (G\u00f6del-L\u00f6b), which captures provable in Peano Arithmetic, one takes modal analogues of the Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions and L\u00f6b's theorem (if it is provable that the provability of A implies A, then A is provable).\n\nSome of the basic results concerning the incompleteness of Peano Arithmetic and related theories have analogues in provability logic. For example, it is a theorem in GL that if a contradiction is not provable then it is not provable that a contradiction is not provable (G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem). There are also modal analogues of the fixed-point theorem. Robert Solovay proved that the modal logic GL is complete with respect to Peano Arithmetic. That is, the propositional theory of provability in Peano Arithmetic is completely represented by the modal logic GL. This straightforwardly implies that propositional reasoning about provability in Peano Arithmetic is complete and decidable.\n\nOther research in provability logic has focused on first-order provability logic, polymodal provability logic (with one modality representing provability in the object theory and another representing provability in the meta-theory), and interpretability logics intended to capture the interaction between provability and interpretability. Some very recent research has involved applications of graded provability algebras to the ordinal analysis of arithmetical theories.\n\nReverse mathematics\n\nReverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics.Simpson 2010 The field was founded by Harvey Friedman. Its defining method can be described as \"going backwards from the theorems to the axioms\", in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms. The reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and Zorn's lemma are equivalent over ZF set theory. The goal of reverse mathematics, however, is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory.\n\nIn reverse mathematics, one starts with a framework language and a base theory\u2014a core axiom system\u2014that is too weak to prove most of the theorems one might be interested in, but still powerful enough to develop the definitions necessary to state these theorems.  For example, to study the theorem \"Every bounded sequence of real numbers has a supremum\" it is necessary to use a base system that can speak of real numbers and sequences of real numbers.\n\nFor each theorem that can be stated in the base system but is not provable in the base system, the goal is to determine the particular axiom system (stronger than the base system) that is necessary to prove that theorem. To show that a system S is required to prove a theorem T, two proofs are required. The first proof shows T is provable from S; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system S. The second proof, known as a reversal, shows that T itself implies S; this proof is carried out in the base system. The reversal establishes that no axiom system S\u2032 that extends the base system can be weaker than S while still proving\u00a0T.\n\nOne striking phenomenon in reverse mathematics is the robustness of the Big Five axiom systems. In order of increasing strength, these systems are named by the initialisms RCA0, WKL0, ACA0, ATR0, and \u03a0-CA0. Nearly every theorem of ordinary mathematics that has been reverse mathematically analyzed has been proven equivalent to one of these five systems. Much recent research has focused on combinatorial principles that do not fit neatly into this framework, like RT (Ramsey's theorem for pairs).\n\nResearch in reverse mathematics often incorporates methods and techniques from recursion theory as well as proof theory.\n\nFunctional interpretations\nFunctional interpretations are interpretations of non-constructive theories in functional ones. Functional interpretations usually proceed in two stages. First, one \"reduces\" a classical theory C to an intuitionistic one I. That is, one provides a constructive mapping that translates the theorems of C to the theorems of I. Second, one reduces the intuitionistic theory I to a quantifier free theory of functionals F. These interpretations contribute to a form of Hilbert's program, since they prove the consistency of classical theories relative to constructive ones. Successful functional interpretations have yielded reductions of infinitary theories to finitary theories and impredicative theories to predicative ones.\n\nFunctional interpretations also provide a way to extract constructive information from proofs in the reduced theory. As a direct consequence of the interpretation one usually obtains the result that any recursive function whose totality can be proven either in I or in C is represented by a term of F. If one can provide an additional interpretation of F in I, which is sometimes possible, this characterization is in fact usually shown to be exact. It often turns out that the terms of F coincide with a natural class of functions, such as the primitive recursive or polynomial-time computable functions. Functional interpretations have also been used to provide ordinal analyses of theories and classify their provably recursive functions.\n\nThe study of functional interpretations began with Kurt G\u00f6del's interpretation of intuitionistic arithmetic in a quantifier-free theory of functionals of finite type. This interpretation is commonly known as the Dialectica interpretation. Together with the double-negation interpretation of classical logic in intuitionistic logic, it provides a reduction of classical arithmetic to intuitionistic arithmetic.\n\nFormal and informal proof\n\nThe informal proofs of everyday mathematical practice are unlike the formal proofs of proof theory. They are rather like high-level sketches that would allow an expert to reconstruct a formal proof at least in principle, given enough time and patience. For most mathematicians, writing a fully formal proof is too pedantic and long-winded to be in common use.\n\nFormal proofs are constructed with the help of computers in interactive theorem proving. \nSignificantly, these proofs can be checked automatically, also by computer. Checking formal proofs is usually simple, whereas finding proofs (automated theorem proving) is generally hard. An informal proof in the mathematics literature, by contrast, requires weeks of peer review to be checked, and may still contain errors.\n\nProof-theoretic semantics\n\nIn linguistics, type-logical grammar, categorial grammar and Montague grammar apply formalisms based on structural proof theory to give a formal natural language semantics.\n\nSee also\n\n Intermediate logic\n Model theory\n Proof (truth)\n Proof techniques\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n J.

{"title": "Rational number", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number", "text": "thumb|The rational numbers (\u211a) are included in the real numbers (\u211d). On the other hand, they include the integers (\u2124), which in turn include the natural numbers (\u2115)\n\nIn mathematics, a rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction  of two integers, a numerator  and a non-zero denominator . Since  may be equal to\u00a01, every integer is a rational number. The set of all rational numbers, often referred to as \"the rationals\", the field of rationals or the field of rational numbers is usually denoted by a boldface  (or blackboard bold , Unicode \u211a); it was thus denoted in 1895 by Giuseppe Peano after quoziente, Italian for \"quotient\".\n\nThe decimal expansion of a rational number always either terminates after a finite number of digits or begins to repeat the same finite sequence of digits over and over. Moreover, any repeating or terminating decimal represents a rational number. These statements hold true not just for base 10, but also for any other integer base (e.g. binary, hexadecimal).\n\nA real number that is not rational is called irrational. Irrational numbers include , , , and . The decimal expansion of an irrational number continues without repeating. Since the set of rational numbers is countable, and the set of real numbers is uncountable, almost all real numbers are irrational.\n\nRational numbers can be formally defined as equivalence classes of pairs of integers  such that , for the equivalence relation defined by  if, and only if . With this formal definition, the fraction  becomes the standard notation for the equivalence class of .\n\nRational numbers together with addition and multiplication form a field which contains the integers and is contained in any field containing the integers. In other words, the field of rational numbers is a prime field, and a field has characteristic zero if and only if it contains the rational numbers as a subfield. Finite extensions of  are called algebraic number fields, and the algebraic closure of  is the field of algebraic numbers.\n\nIn mathematical analysis, the rational numbers form a dense subset of the real numbers. The real numbers can be constructed from the rational numbers by completion, using Cauchy sequences, Dedekind cuts, or infinite decimals.\n\nTerminology\nThe term rational in reference to the set Q refers to the fact that a rational number represents a ratio of two integers. In mathematics, \"rational\" is often used as a noun abbreviating \"rational number\". The adjective rational sometimes means that the coefficients are rational numbers. For example, a rational point is a point with rational coordinates (that is a point whose coordinates are rational numbers); a rational matrix is a matrix of rational numbers; a rational polynomial may be a polynomial with rational coefficients, although the term \"polynomial over the rationals\" is generally preferred, for avoiding confusion with \"rational expression\" and \"rational function\" (a polynomial is a rational expression and defines a rational function, even if its coefficients are not rational numbers). However, a rational curve is not a curve defined over the rationals, but a curve which can be parameterized by rational functions.\n\nArithmetic\n\nIrreducible fraction\nEvery rational number may be expressed in a unique way as an irreducible fraction , where  and  are coprime integers, and . This is often called the canonical form.\n\nStarting from a rational number , its canonical form may be obtained by dividing  and  by their greatest common divisor, and, if , changing the sign of the resulting numerator and denominator.\n\nEmbedding of integers\nAny integer  can be expressed as the rational number , which is its canonical form as a rational number.\n\nEquality\n if and only if \n\nIf both fractions are in canonical form then \n if and only if  and \n\nOrdering\nIf both denominators are positive, and, in particular, if both fractions are in canonical form,\n if and only if \n\nIf either denominator is negative, each fraction with a negative denominator must first be converted into an equivalent form with a positive denominator by changing the signs of both its numerator and denominator.\n\nAddition\nTwo fractions are added as follows:\n\nIf both fractions are in canonical form, the result is in canonical form if and only if  and  are coprime integers.\n\nSubtraction\n\nIf both fractions are in canonical form, the result is in canonical form if and only if  and  are coprime integers.\n\nMultiplication\nThe rule for multiplication is:\n\nEven if both fractions are in canonical form, the result may be a reducible fraction.\n\nInverse\nEvery rational number  has an additive inverse, often called its opposite,\n\nIf  is in canonical form, the same is true for its opposite.\n\nA nonzero rational number  has a multiplicative inverse, also called its reciprocal,\n\nIf  is in canonical form, then the canonical form of its reciprocal is either  or , depending on the sign of .\n\nDivision\nIf both  and  are nonzero, the division rule is \n\nThus, dividing  by  is equivalent to multiplying  by the reciprocal of :\n\nExponentiation to integer power\nIf  is a non-negative integer, then\n\nThe result is in canonical form if the same is true for .\nIn particular, \n\nIf , then\n\nIf  is in canonical form, the canonical form of the result is  if either  or  is even. Otherwise, the canonical form of the result is \n\nContinued fraction representation\n\nA finite continued fraction is an expression such as\n\nwhere an are integers. Every rational number a/b can be represented as a finite continued fraction, whose coefficients an can be determined by applying the Euclidean algorithm to (a,b).\n\n Other representations \n\n common fraction: \n mixed numeral: \n repeating decimal using a vinculum: \n repeating decimal using parentheses: \n continued fraction using traditional typography: \n continued fraction in abbreviated notation: [2; 1, 2]\n egyptian fraction: \n prime power decomposition: \n quote notation: 3!6\n\nare different ways to represent the same rational value.\n\nFormal construction\nthumb|right|300px|A diagram showing a representation of the equivalent classes of pairs of integers\nThe rational numbers may be built as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of integers. \n\nMore precisely, let  be the set of the pairs  of integers such . An equivalence relation is defined on this set by \n if and only if .\n\nAddition and multiplication can be defined by the following rules:\n\nThis equivalence relation is a congruence relation, which means that it is compatible with the addition and multiplication defined above; the set of rational numbers  is the defined as the quotient set by this equivalence relation, , equipped with the addition and the multiplication induced by the above operations. (This construction can be carried out with any integral domain and produces its field of fractions.) \n\nThe equivalence class of a pair  is denoted   \nTwo pairs  and  belong to the same equivalence class (that is are equivalent) if and only if  this means that  if and only \n\nEvery equivalence class  may be represented by infinitely many pairs, since\n\nIt is often convenient to choose, once for all, in each equivalence class a specific element called the canonical representative element. This canonical representative is the unique pair  in the equivalence class such that  and  are coprime, and . It is called the representation in lowest terms of the rational number.\n\nThe integers may be considered to be rational numbers identifying the integer  with the rational number \n\nA total order may be defined on the rational numbers, that extends the natural order of the integers. One has  if\n\nProperties\nthumb|right|200px|A diagram illustrating the countability of the positive rationals\nThe set Q, together with the addition and multiplication operations shown above, forms a field, the field of fractions of the integers Z.\n\nThe rationals are the smallest field with characteristic zero: every other field of characteristic zero contains a copy of Q. The rational numbers are therefore the prime field for characteristic zero.\n\nThe algebraic closure of Q, i.e. the field of roots of rational polynomials, is the algebraic numbers.\n\nThe set of all rational numbers is countable. Since the set of all real numbers is uncountable, we say that almost all real numbers are irrational, in the sense of Lebesgue measure, i.e. the set of rational numbers is a null set.\n\nThe rationals are a densely ordered set: between any two rationals, there sits another one, and, therefore, infinitely many other ones. For example, for any two fractions such that \n\n(where  are positive), we have\n\nAny totally ordered set which is countable, dense (in the above sense), and has no least or greatest element is order isomorphic to the rational numbers.\n\nReal numbers and topological properties\nThe rationals are a dense subset of the real numbers: every real number has rational numbers arbitrarily close to it. A related property is that rational numbers are the only numbers with finite expansions as regular continued fractions.\n\nBy virtue of their order, the rationals carry an order topology. The rational numbers, as a subspace of the real numbers, also carry a subspace topology. The rational numbers form a metric space by using the absolute difference metric  and this yields a third topology on Q. All three topologies coincide and turn the rationals into a topological field. The rational numbers are an important example of a space which is not locally compact. The rationals are characterized topologically as the unique countable metrizable space without isolated points. The space is also totally disconnected. The rational numbers do not form a complete metric space; the real numbers are the completion of Q under the metric  above.\n\np-adic numbers\n\nIn addition to the absolute value metric mentioned above, there are other metrics which turn Q into a topological field:\n\nLet p be a prime number and for any non-zero integer a, let , where pn is the highest power of p dividing a.\n\nIn addition set  For any rational number a/b, we set \n\nThen  defines a metric on Q.\n\nThe metric space (Q,dp) is not complete, and its completion is the p-adic number field Qp. Ostrowski's theorem states that any non-trivial absolute value on the rational numbers Q is equivalent to either the usual real absolute value or a p-adic absolute value.\n\nSee also\nFloating point\nFord circles\nNiven's theorem\nRational data type\nheight of a rational number in lowest term = naive height\nGaussian rational\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Rational Number\" From MathWorld \u2013 A Wolfram Web Resource\n\nCategory:Elementary mathematics\nCategory:Field theory\nCategory:Fractions (mathematics)\n "}
{"title": "Recursion", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion", "text": "thumb|A visual form of recursion known as the Droste effect. The woman in this image holds an object that contains a smaller image of her holding an identical object, which in turn contains a smaller image of herself holding an identical object, and so forth. 1904 Droste cocoa tin, designed by Jan Misset\nRecursion (adjective: recursive) occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.\n\nFormal definitions\nthumb|Ouroboros, an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.\nIn mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibits recursive behavior when it can be defined by two properties:\n A simple base case (or cases)\u2014a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer\n A set of rules that reduces all other cases toward the base case\n\nFor example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:\nOne's parents are one's ancestors (base case).\nThe ancestors of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (recursion step).\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of recursion:\n\nMany mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the natural numbers by the Peano axioms can be described as: 0 is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number. By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers.\n\nRecursively defined mathematical objects include functions, sets, and especially fractals.\n\nThere are various more tongue-in-cheek \"definitions\" of recursion; see recursive humor.\n\nInformal definition\nthumb|Recently refreshed sourdough, bubbling through fermentation: the recipe calls for some sourdough left over from the last time the same recipe was made.\n\nRecursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves  invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'.\n\nTo understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules. The running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps.  An analogy: a procedure is like a written recipe; running a procedure is like actually preparing the meal.\n\nRecursion is related to, but not the same as, a reference within the specification of a procedure to the execution of some other procedure. For instance, a recipe might refer to cooking vegetables, which is another procedure that in turn requires heating water, and so forth. However, a recursive procedure is where (at least) one of its steps calls for a new instance of the very same procedure, like a sourdough recipe calling for some dough left over from the last time the same recipe was made. This immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete, like a sourdough recipe that also tells you how to get some starter dough in case you've never made it before. Even if properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old (partially executed) invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration of how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations. An example could be the following procedure to find a way through a maze. Proceed forward until reaching either an exit or a branching point (a dead end is considered a branching point with 0 branches). If the point reached is an exit, terminate. Otherwise try each branch in turn, using the procedure recursively; if every trial fails by reaching only dead ends, return on the path that led to this branching point and report failure. Whether this actually defines a terminating procedure depends on the nature of the maze: it must not allow loops. In any case, executing the procedure requires carefully recording all currently explored branching points, and which of their branches have already been exhaustively tried.\n\nIn language\nLinguist Noam Chomsky among many others has argued that the lack of an upper bound on the number of grammatical sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language. This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous, in which the sentence witches are dangerous occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.\n\nThis provides a way of understanding the creativity of language\u2014the unbounded number of grammatical sentences\u2014because it immediately predicts that sentences can be of arbitrary length: Dorothy thinks that Toto suspects that Tin Man said that.... There are many structures apart from sentences that can be defined recursively, and therefore many ways in which a sentence can embed instances of one category inside another. Over the years, languages in general have proved amenable to this kind of analysis.\n\nRecently, however, the generally accepted idea that recursion is an essential property of human language has been challenged by Daniel Everett on the basis of his claims about the Pirah\u00e3 language. Andrew Nevins, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues are among many who have argued against this. Literary self-reference can in any case be argued to be different in kind from mathematical or logical recursion.\n\nRecursion plays a crucial role not only in syntax, but also in natural language semantics. The word and, for example, can be construed as a function that can apply to sentence meanings to create new sentences, and likewise for noun phrase meanings, verb phrase meanings, and others. It can also apply to intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, or ditransitive verbs. In order to provide a single denotation for it that is suitably flexible, and is typically defined so that it can take any of these different types of meanings as arguments. This can be done by defining it for a simple case in which it combines sentences, and then defining the other cases recursively in terms of the simple one.Barbara Partee and Mats Rooth. 1983. In Rainer B\u00e4uerle et al., Meaning, Use, and Interpretation of Language. Reprinted in Paul Portner and Barbara Partee, eds. 2002. Formal Semantics: The Essential Readings. Blackwell. \n\nA recursive grammar is a formal grammar that contains recursive production rules..\n\nRecursive humor\nRecursion is sometimes used humorously in computer science, programming, philosophy, or mathematics textbooks, generally by giving a circular definition or self-reference, in which the putative recursive step does not get closer to a base case, but instead leads to an infinite regress. It is not unusual for such books to include a joke entry in their glossary along the lines of:\nRecursion, see Recursion.\n\nA variation is found on page 269 in the index  of some editions of Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book The C Programming Language; the index entry recursively references itself (\"recursion 86, 139, 141, 182, 202, 269\"). Early versions of this joke can be fund in \"Let's talk Lisp\" by Laurent Sikl\u00f3ssy (published by Prentice Hall PTR on December, 1, 1975 with a copyright date of 1976) and in \"Software Tools\" by Kernighan and Plauger (published by Addison-Wesley Professional on January, 11, 1976). The joke also appears in \"The UNIX Programming Environment\" by Kernighan and Pike. It did not appear in the first edition of The C Programming Language. The joke is part of the Functional programming folklore and was already widespread in the functional programming community before the publication of the afore-mentioned books. \n\nAnother joke is that \"To understand recursion, you must understand recursion.\" In the English-language version of the Google web search engine, when a search for \"recursion\" is made, the site suggests \"Did you mean: recursion.\" An alternative form is the following, from Andrew Plotkin: \"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to Douglas Hofstadter than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is.\"\n\nRecursive acronyms are other examples of recursive humor. PHP, for example, stands for \"PHP Hypertext Preprocessor\", WINE stands for \"WINE Is Not an Emulator\" GNU stands for \"GNU's not Unix\", and SPARQL denotes the \"SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language\".\n\nIn mathematics\nthumb|250px|The Sierpinski triangle\u2014a confined recursion of triangles that form a fractal\n\nRecursively defined sets\n\nExample: the natural numbers\n\nThe canonical example of a recursively defined set is given by the natural numbers:\n\n0 is in \nif n is in , then n + 1 is in \nThe set of natural numbers is the smallest set satisfying the previous two properties.\n\nIn mathematical logic, the Peano axioms (or Peano postulates or Dedekind\u2013Peano axioms), are axioms for the natural numbers presented in the 19th century by the German mathematician Richard Dedekind and by the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. The Peano Axioms define the natural numbers referring to a recursive successor function and addition and multiplication as recursive functions. \n\nExample: Proof procedure \nAnother interesting example is the set of all \"provable\" propositions in an axiomatic system that are defined in terms of a prof procedure which is inductively (or recursively) defined as follows:\n\nIf a proposition is an axiom, it is a provable proposition.\nIf a proposition can be derived from true reachable propositions by means of inference rules, it is a provable proposition.\nThe set of provable propositions is the smallest set of propositions satisfying these conditions.\n\nFinite subdivision rules\n\nFinite subdivision rules are a geometric form of recursion, which can be used to create fractal-like images. A subdivision rule starts with a collection of polygons labelled by finitely many labels, and then each polygon is subdivided into smaller labelled polygons in a way that depends only on the labels of the original polygon. This process can be iterated. The standard `middle thirds' technique for creating the Cantor set is a subdivision rule, as is barycentric subdivision.\n\nFunctional recursion\nA function may be recursively defined in terms of itself.  A familiar example is the Fibonacci number sequence: F(n) = F(n \u2212 1) + F(n \u2212 2).  For such a definition to be useful, it must lead to non-recursively defined values, in this case F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.\n\nA famous recursive function is the Ackermann function, which, unlike the Fibonacci sequence, cannot be expressed without recursion.\n\nProofs involving recursive definitions\nApplying the standard technique of proof by cases to recursively defined sets or functions, as in the preceding sections, yields structural induction, a powerful generalization of mathematical induction widely used to derive proofs in mathematical logic and computer science.\n\nRecursive optimization\nDynamic programming is an approach to optimization that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form. The key result in dynamic programming is the Bellman equation, which writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time (or earlier step) in terms of its value at a later time (or later step).\n\nThe recursion theorem\nIn set theory, this is a theorem guaranteeing that recursively defined functions exist.  Given a set X, an element a of X and a function , the theorem states that there is a unique function  (where  denotes the set of natural numbers including zero) such that\n\nfor any natural number n.\n\nProof of uniqueness\nTake two functions   and   such that:\n\nwhere a is an element of X.\n\nIt can be proved by mathematical induction that  for all natural numbers n:\n\nBase Case:  so the equality holds for .\n\nInductive Step: Suppose  for some . Then \nHence F(k) = G(k) implies F(k+1) = G(k+1).\n\nBy induction,  for all .\n\nIn computer science\n\nA common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a computer programming technique, this is called divide and conquer and is key to the design of many important algorithms. Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances. A contrary approach is dynamic programming. This approach serves as a bottom-up approach, where problems are solved by solving larger and larger instances, until the desired size is reached.\n\nA classic example of recursion is the definition of the factorial function, given here in C code:\n\nunsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {\n    if (n == 0) {\n        return 1;\n    } else {\n        return n * factorial(n - 1);\n    }\n}\n\nThe function calls itself recursively on a smaller version of the input  and multiplies the result of the recursive call by , until reaching the base case, analogously to the mathematical definition of factorial.\n\nRecursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem. One example application of recursion is in parsers for programming languages. The great advantage of recursion is that an infinite set of possible sentences, designs or other data can be defined, parsed or produced by a finite computer program.\n\nRecurrence relations are equations to define one or more sequences recursively. Some specific kinds of recurrence relation can be \"solved\" to obtain a non-recursive definition.\n\nUse of recursion in an algorithm has both advantages and disadvantages.  The main advantage is usually simplicity.

{"title": "Sierpinski carpet", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_carpet", "text": "thumb|6 steps of a Sierpinski carpet.\n\nThe Sierpinski carpet is a plane fractal first described by Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski in 1916.  The carpet is one generalization of the Cantor set to two dimensions; another is the Cantor dust.\n\nThe technique of subdividing a shape into smaller copies of itself, removing one or more copies, and continuing recursively can be extended to other shapes. For instance, subdividing an equilateral triangle into four equilateral triangles, removing the middle triangle, and recursing leads to the Sierpinski triangle. In three dimensions, a similar construction based on cubes is known as the Menger sponge.\n\nConstruction\nThe construction of the Sierpinski carpet begins with a square. The square is cut into 9 congruent subsquares in a 3-by-3 grid, and the central subsquare is removed. The same procedure is then applied recursively to the remaining 8 subsquares, ad infinitum.  It can be realised as the set of points in the unit square whose coordinates written in base three do not both have a digit '1' in the same position.\n\nThe process of recursively removing squares is an example of a finite subdivision rule.\n\nThe Sierpinski carpet can also be created by iterating every pixel in a square and using the following algorithm to decide if the pixel is filled.  The following implementation is valid C, C++, and most languages derived from C.\n\n/*\n* Decides if a point at a specific location is filled or not.  This works by iteration first checking if\n* the pixel is unfilled in successively larger squares or cannot be in the center of any larger square.\n* x is the x coordinate of the point being checked with zero being the first pixel\n* y is the y coordinate of the point being checked with zero being the first pixel\n* 1 if it is to be filled or 0 if it is open\n*/\nint isSierpinskiCarpetPixelFilled(int x, int y)\n{\n    while (x > 0 || y > 0) // when either of these reaches zero the pixel is determined to be on the edge \n                               // at that square level and must be filled\n    {\n        if (x % 3 == 1 && y % 3 == 1) //checks if the pixel is in the center for the current square level\n            return 0;\n        x /= 3; //x and y are decremented to check the next larger square level\n        y /= 3;\n    }\n    return 1; // if all possible square levels are checked and the pixel is not determined \n                   // to be open it must be filled\n}\n\nProcess\n122px 122px 122px 122px 122px 122px\n\nProperties\nthumb|Variant of the Peano curve with the middle line erased creates a Sierpinski carpet\n\nThe area of the carpet is zero (in standard Lebesgue measure).\nProof: Denote as  the area of iteration . Then . So , which tends to 0 as  goes to infinity.\n\nThe interior of the carpet is empty.\nProof: Suppose by contradiction that there is a point  in the interior of the carpet. Then there is a square centered at  which is entirely contained in the carpet. This square contains a smaller square whose coordinates are multiples of  for some . But, this square must have been holed in iteration , so it cannot be contained in the carpet \u2013 a contradiction.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the carpet is .\n\nSierpi\u0144ski demonstrated that his carpet is a universal plane curve. That is: the Sierpinski carpet is a compact subset of the plane with Lebesgue covering dimension 1, and every subset of the plane with these properties is homeomorphic to some subset of the Sierpinski carpet.\n\nThis 'universality' of the Sierpinski carpet is not a true universal property in the sense of category theory: it does not uniquely characterize this space up to homeomorphism.  For example, the disjoint union of a Sierpinski carpet and a circle is also a universal plane curve.  However, in 1958 Gordon Whyburn uniquely characterized the Sierpinski carpet as follows:  any curve that is locally connected and has no 'local cut-points' is homeomorphic to the Sierpinski carpet.  Here a local cut-point is a point  for which some connected neighborhood  of  has the property that  is not connected.  So, for example, any point of the circle is a local cut point.\n\nIn the same paper Whyburn gave another characterization of the Sierpinski carpet.   Recall that a continuum is a nonempty connected compact metric space.  Suppose  is a continuum embedded in the plane.  Suppose its complement in the plane has countably many connected components  and suppose:\n\n the diameter of  goes to zero as ;\n the boundary of  and the boundary of  are disjoint if ;\n the boundary of  is a simple closed curve for each ;\n the union of the boundaries of the sets  is dense in .\n\nThen  is homeomorphic to the Sierpinski carpet.\n\nBrownian motion on the Sierpinski carpet\nThe topic of Brownian motion on the Sierpinski carpet has attracted interest in recent years. Martin Barlow and Richard Bass have shown that a random walk on the Sierpinski carpet diffuses at a slower rate than an unrestricted random walk in the plane. The latter reaches a mean distance proportional to  after  steps, but the random walk on the discrete Sierpinski carpet reaches only a mean distance proportional to  for some . They also showed that this random walk satisfies stronger large deviation inequalities (so called \"sub-Gaussian inequalities\") and that it satisfies the elliptic Harnack inequality without satisfying the parabolic one. The existence of such an example was an open problem for many years.\n\nWallis sieve\nthumb|Third iteration of the Wallis sieve\n\nA variation of the Sierpinski carpet, called the Wallis sieve, starts in the same way, by subdividing the unit square into nine smaller squares and removing the middle of them. At the next level of subdivision, it subdivides each of the squares into 25 smaller squares and removes the middle one, and it continues at the th step by subdividing each square into  (the odd squares) smaller squares and removing the middle one.\n\nBy the Wallis product, the area of the resulting set is , unlike the standard Sierpinski carpet which has zero limiting area.\n\nHowever, by the results of Whyburn mentioned above, we can see that the Wallis sieve is homeomorphic to the Sierpinski carpet. In particular, its interior is still empty.\n\n Applications \nMobile phone and WiFi fractal antennas have been produced in the form of few iterations of the Sierpinski carpet. Due to their self-similarity and scale invariance, they easily accommodate multiple frequencies. They are also easy to fabricate and smaller than conventional antennas of similar performance, thus being optimal for pocket-sized mobile phones.\n\n See also \n List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension\n Menger sponge\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Variations on the Theme of Tremas II\n Sierpi\u0144ski Cookies\n Sierpinski Carpet Project\n Sierpinski Carpet solved by means of modular arithmetics\n\nCategory:Iterated function system fractals\nCategory:Curves\nCategory:Topological spaces\nCategory:Science and technology in Poland"}
{"title": "Space-filling curve", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve", "text": "400px|thumb|Three iterations of the Peano curve construction, whose limit is a space-filling curve.\nIn mathematical analysis, a space-filling curve is a curve whose range contains the entire 2-dimensional unit square (or more generally an n-dimensional unit hypercube). Because Giuseppe Peano (1858\u20131932) was the first to discover one, space-filling curves in the 2-dimensional plane are sometimes called Peano curves, but that phrase also refers to the Peano curve, the specific example of a space-filling curve found by Peano.\n\n Definition \nIntuitively, a continuous curve in 2 or 3 (or higher) dimensions can be thought of as the path of a continuously moving point.  To eliminate the inherent vagueness of this notion, Jordan in 1887 introduced the following rigorous definition, which has since been adopted as the precise description of the notion of a continuous curve:\n\nIn the most general form, the range of such a function may lie in an arbitrary topological space, but in the most commonly studied cases, the range will lie in a Euclidean space such as the 2-dimensional plane (a planar curve) or the 3-dimensional space (space curve).\n\nSometimes, the curve is identified with the range or image of the function (the set of all possible values of the function), instead of the function itself.  It is also possible to define curves without endpoints to be a continuous function on the real line (or on the open unit interval (0, 1)).\n\nHistory\nIn 1890, Peano discovered a continuous curve, now called the Peano curve, that passes through every point of the unit square (). His purpose was to construct a continuous mapping from the unit interval  onto the unit square. Peano was motivated by Georg Cantor's earlier counterintuitive result that the infinite number of points in a unit interval is the same cardinality as the infinite number of points in any finite-dimensional manifold, such as the unit square.  The problem Peano solved was whether such a mapping could be continuous; i.e., a curve that fills a space. Peano's solution does not set up a continuous one-to-one correspondence between the unit interval and the unit square, and indeed such a correspondence does not exist (see \"Properties\" below).\n\nIt was common to associate the vague notions of thinness and 1-dimensionality to curves; all normally encountered curves were piecewise differentiable (that is, have piecewise continuous derivatives), and such curves cannot fill up the entire unit square.  Therefore, Peano's space-filling curve was found to be highly counterintuitive.\n\nFrom Peano's example, it was easy to deduce continuous curves whose ranges contained the n-dimensional hypercube (for any positive integer n). It was also easy to extend Peano's example to continuous curves without endpoints, which filled the entire n-dimensional Euclidean space (where n is 2, 3, or any other positive integer).\n\nMost well-known space-filling curves are constructed iteratively as the limit of a sequence of piecewise linear continuous curves, each one more closely approximating the space-filling limit.\n\nPeano's ground-breaking article contained no illustrations of his construction, which is defined in terms of ternary expansions and a mirroring operator.  But the graphical construction was perfectly clear to him\u2014he made an ornamental tiling showing a picture of the curve in his home in Turin.  Peano's article also ends by observing that the technique can be obviously extended to other odd bases besides base 3.  His choice to avoid any appeal to graphical visualization was, no doubt, motivated by a desire for a well-founded, completely rigorous proof owing nothing to pictures.  At that time (the beginning of the foundation of general topology), graphical arguments were still included in proofs, yet were becoming a hindrance to understanding often counterintuitive results.\n\nA year later, David Hilbert published in the same journal a variation of Peano's construction (). Hilbert's article was the first to include a picture helping to visualize the construction technique, essentially the same as illustrated here.  The analytic form of the Hilbert curve, however, is more complicated than Peano's.\n\n400px|thumb|Six iterations of the Hilbert curve construction, whose limiting space-filling curve was devised by mathematician David Hilbert.\n\n Outline of the construction of a space-filling curve \nLet  denote the Cantor space .\n\nWe start with a continuous function  from the Cantor space  onto the entire unit interval .  (The restriction of the Cantor function to the Cantor set is an example of such a function.)  From it, we get a continuous function  from the topological product  onto the entire unit square  by setting\n\nSince the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the product , there is a continuous bijection  from the Cantor set onto . The composition  of  and  is a continuous function mapping the Cantor set onto the entire unit square.  (Alternatively, we could use the theorem that every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set to get the function .)\n\nFinally, one can extend  to a continuous function  whose domain is the entire unit interval .  This can be done either by using the Tietze extension theorem on each of the components of , or by simply extending  \"linearly\" (that is, on each of the deleted open interval  in the construction of the Cantor set, we define the extension part of  on  to be the line segment within the unit square joining the values  and ).\n\n Properties \nIf a curve is not injective, then one can find two intersecting subcurves of the curve, each obtained by considering the images of two disjoint segments from the curve's domain (the unit line segment).  The two subcurves intersect if the intersection of the two images is non-empty.  One might be tempted to think that the meaning of curves intersecting is that they necessarily cross each other, like the intersection point of two non-parallel lines, from one side to the other.  However, two curves (or two subcurves of one curve) may contact one another without crossing, as, for example, a line tangent to a circle does.\n\nA non-self-intersecting continuous curve cannot fill the unit square because that will make the curve a homeomorphism from the unit interval onto the unit square (any continuous bijection from a compact space onto a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism).  But a unit square has no cut-point, and so cannot be homeomorphic to the unit interval, in which all points except the endpoints are cut-points. There exist non-self-intersecting curves of nonzero area, the Osgood curves, but they are not space-filling.\n\nFor the classic Peano and Hilbert space-filling curves, where two subcurves intersect (in the technical sense), there is self-contact without self-crossing. A space-filling curve can be (everywhere) self-crossing if its approximation curves are self-crossing.  A space-filling curve's approximations can be self-avoiding, as the figures above illustrate.  In 3 dimensions, self-avoiding approximation curves can even contain knots.  Approximation curves remain within a bounded portion of n-dimensional space, but their lengths increase without bound.\n\nSpace-filling curves are special cases of fractal constructions.  No differentiable space-filling curve can exist. Roughly speaking, differentiability puts a bound on how fast the curve can turn.\n\n The Hahn\u2013Mazurkiewicz theorem \nThe Hahn\u2013Mazurkiewicz theorem is the following characterization of spaces that are the continuous image of curves:\n\nA non-empty Hausdorff topological space is a continuous image of the unit interval if and only if it is a compact, connected, locally connected second-countable space.\n\nSpaces that are the continuous image of a unit interval are sometimes called Peano spaces.\n\nIn many formulations of the Hahn\u2013Mazurkiewicz theorem, second-countable is replaced by metrizable.  These two formulations are equivalent.  In one direction a compact Hausdorff space is a normal space and, by the Urysohn metrization theorem, second-countable then implies metrizable. Conversely a compact metric space is second-countable.\n\nKleinian groups\n\nThere are many natural examples of space-filling, or rather sphere-filling, curves in the theory of doubly degenerate Kleinian groups. For example,\n showed that the circle at infinity of the universal cover of a fiber of a mapping torus of a pseudo-Anosov map is a sphere-filling curve. (Here the sphere is the sphere at infinity of hyperbolic 3-space.)\n\nIntegration\n\nWiener pointed out in The Fourier Integral and Certain of its Applications that space filling curves could be used to reduce Lebesgue integration in higher dimensions to Lebesgue integration in one dimension.\n\nSee also\n Dragon curve\n Gosper curve\n Hilbert curve\n Koch curve\n Moore curve\n Murray polygon\n Sierpi\u0144ski curve\n Space-filling tree\n Spatial index\n Hilbert R-tree\n Bx-tree\n Z-order (curve) (Morton-order)\n List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension\n\nReferences\n \n \n .\n .\n .\n .\n\nExternal links\n\n Multidimensional Space-Filling Curves\n Proof of the existence of a bijection at cut-the-knot\n\nJava applets:\n Peano Plane Filling Curves at cut-the-knot\n Hilbert's and Moore's Plane Filling Curves at cut-the-knot\n All Peano Plane Filling Curves at cut-the-knot\n\nCategory:Continuous mappings\nCategory:Fractal curves\nCategory:Iterated function system fractals"}

{"title": "Venice, Los Angeles", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice%2C_Los_Angeles", "text": "Venice is a residential, commercial, and recreational beachfront neighborhood within Los Angeles, California. It is located within the urban region of western Los Angeles County known as the Westside.\n\nVenice was founded in 1905 as a seaside resort town. It was an independent city until 1926, when it merged with Los Angeles. Today, Venice is known for its canals, beaches, and the circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a   pedestrian promenade that features performers, fortune-tellers, artists and vendors. In the latter half of the 2010s, the neighborhood has faced severe gentrification that raised real-estate prices and pushed out many long-term inhabitants.\n\nHistory\n19th century\nIn 1839, a region called La Ballona that included the southern parts of Venice, was granted by the Mexican government to Machados and Talamantes, giving them title to Rancho La Ballona.diseno Rancho La Ballona1900 USGS topographic mapMap of old Spanish and Mexican ranchos in Los Angeles County Later this became part of Port Ballona.\n\nFounding\nright|thumb|Venice Pavilion and Ship Cafe, ca.1905\u20131913\nthumb|right|Windward Avenue, 1913\n\nVenice, originally called \"Venice of America,\" was founded by wealthy developer Abbot Kinney in 1905 as a beach resort town,  west of Los Angeles. He and his partner Francis Ryan had bought two miles (3.24 km) of oceanfront property south of Santa Monica in 1891. They built a resort town on the north end of the property, called Ocean Park, which was soon annexed to Santa Monica. After Ryan died, Kinney and his new partners continued building south of Navy Street. After the partnership dissolved in 1904, Kinney, who had won the marshy land on the south end of the property in a coin flip with his former partners, began to build a seaside resort like the namesake Italian city.\n\nWhen Venice of America opened on July 4, 1905, Kinney had dug several miles of canals to drain the marshes for his residential area, built a -long pleasure pier with an auditorium, ship restaurant, and dance hall, constructed a hot salt-water plunge, and built a block-long arcaded business street with Venetian architecture. Kinney hired artist Felix Peano to design the columns of the buildings. Included in the capitals are several faces, modeled after Kinney himself and a local girl named Nettie Bouck.\n\nthumb|Capital designed by Felix Peano, featuring faces of Abbot Kinney (L) and Nettie Bouck (R)\n\nTourists, mostly arriving on the \"Red Cars\" of the Pacific Electric Railway from Los Angeles and Santa Monica, then rode the Venice Miniature Railway and gondolas to tour the town. The biggest attraction was Venice's mile-long gently sloping beach. Cottages and housekeeping tents were available for rent.\n\nThe population (3,119 residents in 1910) soon exceeded 10,000; the town drew 50,000 to 150,000 tourists on weekends.\n\nAmusement pier\nthumb|right|People strolling by the dance hall on the amusement pier, 1920 or before\nthumb|right|Crowds between 17th and 34th streets, with roller coaster in background, 1920 or before\n\nAttractions on the Kinney Pier became more amusement-oriented by 1910, when a Venice Miniature Railway, Aquarium, Virginia Reel, Whip, Racing Derby, and other rides and game booths were added. Since the business district was allotted only three one-block-long streets, and the City Hall was more than a mile away, other competing business districts developed. Unfortunately, this created a fractious political climate. Kinney, however, governed with an iron hand and kept things in check. When he died in November 1920, Venice became harder to govern. With the amusement pier burning six weeks later in December 1920, and Prohibition (which had begun the previous January), the town's tax revenue was severely affected.\n\nThe Kinney family rebuilt their amusement pier quickly to compete with Ocean Park's Pickering Pleasure Pier and the new Sunset Pier. When it opened it had two roller coasters, a new Racing Derby, a Noah's Ark, a Mill Chutes, and many other rides. By 1925 with the addition of a third coaster, a tall Dragon Slide, Fun House, and Flying Circus aerial ride, it was the finest amusement pier on the West Coast. Several hundred thousand tourists visited on weekends. In 1923 Charles Lick built the Lick Pier at Navy Street in Venice, adjacent to the Ocean Park Pier at Pier Avenue in Ocean Park. Another pier was planned for Venice in 1925 at Leona Street (now Washington Street).\n\nFor the amusement of the public, Kinney hired aviators to do aerial stunts over the beach. One of them, movie aviator and Venice airport owner B. H. DeLay, implemented the first lighted airport in the United States on DeLay Field (previously known as Ince Field). He also initiated the first aerial police in the nation, after a marine rescue attempt was thwarted. DeLay also performed many of the world's first aerial stunts for motion pictures in Venice.\n\nPolitics\nBy 1925, Venice's politics had become unmanageable. Its roads, water and sewage systems badly needed repair and expansion to keep up with its growing population. When it was proposed that Venice be annexed to Los Angeles, the board of trustees voted to hold an election.  Annexation was approved in the election in November 1925, and Venice was formally annexed to Los Angeles in 1926.\n\nLos Angeles annexed Venice and many streets were paved in 1929 after a three-year court battle led by canal residents. Following their annexation to Los Angeles, its Parks and Recreation department intended to close Venice's three amusement piers, but had to wait until the first of the tidelands leases expired in 1946.\n\nOil\nIn 1929, oil was discovered south of Washington Street on the Venice Peninsula, now known as the Marina Peninsula neighborhood of Los Angeles. Within two years, 450 oil wells covered the area, and drilling waste clogged the remaining waterways. It was a short-lived boom that provided needed income to the community, which suffered during the Great Depression. The wells produced oil into the 1970s.\n\nNeglect\nLos Angeles had neglected Venice so long that, by the 1950s, it had become the \"Slum by the Sea.\" With the exception of new police and fire stations in 1930, the city spent little on improvements after annexation. The city did not pave Trolleyway (Pacific Avenue) until 1954 when county and state funds became available. Low rents for run-down bungalows attracted predominantly European immigrants (including a substantial number of Holocaust survivors) and young counterculture artists, poets, and writers. The Beat Generation hung out at the Gas House on Ocean Front Walk and at Venice West Cafe on Dudley. Police raids were frequent during that era.\n\nPast gang activity\nThe Venice Shoreline Crips and the Latino Venice 13 (V-13) were the two main gangs active in Venice. V13 dates back to the 1950s, while the Shoreline Crips were founded in the early 1970s, making them one of the first Crip sets in Los Angeles.  In the early 1990s V-13 and the Shoreline Crips were involved in a fierce battle over crack cocaine sales territories.\n\nBy 2002, the numbers of gang members in Venice were reduced due to gentrification and increased police presence. According to a Los Angeles City Beat article, by 2003, many Los Angeles Westside gang members had resettled in the city of Inglewood.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, Venice is adjoined on the northwest by Santa Monica, on the northeast by Mar Vista, on the southeast by Culver City, Del Rey and Marina Del Rey, on the south by Ballona Creek and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. \"Westside,\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times\n\nthumb|right| Aerial view of Marina del Rey, Playa del Rey, Playa Vista, Venice Beach and Los Angeles International Airport\n\nVenice is bounded on the northwest by the Santa Monica city line. The northern apex of the Venice neighborhood is at Walgrove Avenue and Rose Avenue abutting the Santa Monica Airport. On the east the boundary runs north-south on Walgrove Avenue to the neighborhood's eastern apex at Zanja Street, thus including the Penmar Golf Course but excluding Venice High School.

During the depression era, Upton Sinclair had an office there when he was running for governor, and the same historic building where the restaurant was located was also the site of the first Ace/Venice Gallery in the early 1970s (sic: Spelling of \"Chrismas\") and, before that, the studio of American installation artist Robert Irwin.\n\nHistoric post office\nthumb|Post office mural\nThe Venice Post Office, a red-tile-roofed 1939 Works Progress Administration building designed by Louis A.

Senior curator of American Art at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Ilene Susan Fort, said this is one of the better New Deal murals both artistically and historically.

LACMA highlighted the mural with an exhibit that displayed additional Biberman artworks, rare historical documents and Venice ephemera with the restored mural. Silver has a long-term lease on the mural that is still owned by the US Postal Service. As of June 2016, the building remains under halted construction, with completion subject to resolution of multiple property liens.  The mural's whereabouts are unknown, putting the lessee in violation of the lease agreement's public access requirement.\n\nResidences and streets\nMany of Venice's houses have their principal entries from pedestrian-only streets and have house numbers on these footpaths. (Automobile access is by alleys in the rear.) The inland walk streets are made up primarily of around 620 single-family homes.Leah Ziskin (August 12, 2007), It's purely pedestrian Los Angeles Times. Like much of the rest of Los Angeles, however, Venice is known for traffic congestion. It lies  away from the nearest freeway, and its unusually dense network of narrow streets was not planned for modern traffic. Mindful of the tourist nature of much of the district's vehicle traffic, its residents have successfully fought numerous attempts to extend the Marina Freeway (SR 90) into southern Venice.\n\nVenice Beach\nthumb|right|Sunset at Venice Beach\nthumb|right|upright=0.4|King Solomon the Snake Charmer on the Venice boardwalk\n\nVenice Beach, which receives millions of visitors a year, has been labeled as \"a cultural hub known for its eccentricities\" as well as a \"global tourist destination.\"Ari Bloomekatz and Abby Sewell, \"Car Plows Through Crowd on Venice Boardwalk, Killing One,\" Los Angeles Times, August 3, 2013David Zahniser and Matt Stevens, \"L.A.

A  concrete structure, it first opened in 1964, was closed in 1983 due to El Ni\u00f1o storm damage, and re-opened in the mid-1990s. On December 21, 2005, the pier again suffered damage when waves from a large northern swell caused part of it to fall into the ocean. The pier remained closed until May 25, 2006, when it was re-opened after an engineering study concluded that it was structurally sound.\n\nBreakwater\nThe Venice Breakwater is an acclaimed local surf spot in Venice. It is located north of the Venice Pier and lifeguard headquarters and south of the Santa Monica Pier. This spot is sheltered on the north by an artificial barrier, the breakwater, consisting of an extending sand bar, piping, and large rocks at its end.\n\nIn late 2010, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors conducted a $1.6\u00a0million replacement of 30,000 cubic yards of sand at Venice Beach eroded by rainstorms in recent years. Although Venice Beach is located in the city of Los Angeles, the county is responsible for maintaining the beach under an agreement reached between the two governments in 1975.Rong-Gong Lin II (October 12, 2010), $1.6-million county project approved to replace sand on Venice Beach Los Angeles Times.\n\nOakwood\nThe Oakwood portion of Venice, also known as \"Ghost Town\" and the \"Oakwood Pentagon,\" lies inland from the tourist areas and is one of the few historically African-American areas in West Los Angeles, though Latinos now constitute the majority of the residents. During the age of restrictive covenants that enforced racial segregation, Oakwood was set aside as a settlement area for Black Americans, who came by the hundreds to Venice to work in the oil fields during the 1930s and 1940s. After the construction of the San Diego Freeway, which passed through predominantly Mexican-American and immigrant communities, those groups moved further west and into Oakwood where black residents were already established. Some White Americans (most notably actor and filmmaker Dennis Hopper) moved into Oakwood during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, gentrification had altered Oakwood. Although still a primarily Latino and African-American neighborhood, the neighborhood is in flux. According to Los Angeles City Beat, \"In Venice, the transformation is... obvious. Homes are fetching sometimes more than $1 million, and homies are being displaced every day.\" In 2012, the Los Angeles Times reported the prediction that the wine shops, cafes, restaurants and other businesses opening on Rose Avenue\u2014adjacent to Oakwood\u2014would soon lead to the other streets of Venice being transformed into upmarket areas. Xinachtli, a Latino student group from Venice High School and subset of MEChA, refers to Oakwood as one of the last beachside communities of color in California. A majority of Venice High School's student body is composed of those of Hispanic or Latino origin.\n\nEast Venice\nEast Venice is a racially and ethnically mixed residential neighborhood of Venice that is separated from Oakwood and Milwood (the area south of Oakwood) by Lincoln Boulevard, extending east to the border with the Mar Vista neighborhood, near Venice High School and Santa Monica Municipal Airport. Aside from the commercial strip on Lincoln (including the Venice Boys and Girls Club and the Venice United Methodist Church), the area almost entirely consists of small homes and apartments as well as Penmar Park and (bordering Santa Monica) Penmar Golf Course. The existing population (primarily composed of Whites, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asians, with small numbers of other groups) is being supplemented by new arrivals who have moved in with gentrification.\n\nA housing project, Lincoln Place Apartment Homes, built by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles is currently undergoing a $140\u00a0million renovation to add 99 new market-rate apartment homes and to update the remaining 696 existing homes. A new pool, two-story fitness center, resident park and sustainable landscaping are being added. multifamilybiz.com Aimco, which acquired the property in 2003, had previously been in a legal battle to determine whether or not Lincoln Place could be demolished and rebuilt. In 2010, Aimco settled with tenants and agreed to reopen the project and return scores of evicted residents to their homes and add hundreds of units to the Venice area.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 37,705 residents in the 3.17-square-mile Venice neighborhood\u2014an average of 11,891 people per square mile, about the norm for Los Angeles; in 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 40,885. The median age for residents was 35, considered the average for Los Angeles; the percentages of residents aged 19 through 49 were among the county's highest.\n\nThe ethnic breakdown was 64.2% Non-Hispanic White, 21.7% Latino (of any racial origin); 5.4% African American; 4.1% Asian, and 4.6% of other origins. About 22.3% of residents had been born abroad, a relatively low figure for Los Angeles; Mexico (38.4%) and the United Kingdom (8.5%) were their most common places of birth.\n\nThe median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $67,647, a high figure for Los Angeles. The percentage of households earning $125,000 was considered high for the city. The average household size of 1.9 people was low for both the city and the county. Renters occupied 68.8% of the housing stock and house- or apartment owners held 31.2%. Property values have been increasing lately due to the presence of technology companies such as Google Inc. (which in 2011 began leasing 100,000 square feet of space in Venice) and Snap Inc. (which leases property on Market Street and Abbot Kinney).Donna Kardos Yesalavich (April 1, 2014), Cut!

The percentage of veterans who had served during the Vietnam War was among the county's highest.\n\nArts and culture\nthumb|One of the many murals of Venice\nthumb|Palm trees along the Venice Boardwalk\n\nVenice is known as a hangout for the creative and the artistic.

The Doors would go on to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and are considered one of the greatest rock groups of all time, with Morrison being considered one of the greatest rock frontmen. Venice would also be the birthplace of another legendary rock band in the 1980s in Jane's Addiction. Perry Farrell, frontman and founder of Lollapalooza, was a longtime Venice resident until 2010.\n\nVenice in the 1980s also had a large number of bands playing music known as crossover thrash, a hardcore punk/thrash metal musical hybrid.

Thus, the Wronskian can be used to show that a set of differentiable functions is linearly independent on an interval by showing that it does not vanish identically. It may, however, vanish at isolated points.\n\nA common misconception is that  everywhere implies linear dependence, but  pointed out that the functions  and  have continuous derivatives and their Wronskian vanishes everywhere, yet they are not linearly dependent in any neighborhood of . There are several extra conditions which ensure that the vanishing of the Wronskian in an interval implies linear dependence.\n observed that if the functions are analytic, then the vanishing of the Wronskian in an interval implies that they are linearly dependent. (Peano  published his example twice, because the first time he published it an editor Paul Mansion, who had written a textbook incorrectly claiming that the vanishing of the Wronskian implies linear dependence, added a footnote to Peano's paper claiming that this result is correct as long as neither function is identically zero. Peano's second paper pointed out that this footnote was nonsense.)  gave several other conditions for the vanishing of the Wronskian to imply linear dependence; for example, if the Wronskian of  functions is identically zero and the  Wronskians of  of them do not all vanish at any point then the functions are linearly dependent.  gave a more general condition that together with the vanishing of the Wronskian implies linear dependence.\n\nOver fields of positive characteristic p the Wronskian may vanish even for linearly independent polynomials; for example, the Wronskian of xp and 1 is identically 0.\n\nApplication to linear differential equations\nIn general, for an th order linear differential equation, if  solutions are known, the last one can be determined by using the Wronskian.\n\nConsider the second order differential equation in Lagrange's notation\n\nwhere  are known functions of  and  is the yet to be determined function.

Then, by the definition of the Wronskian,  obeys a first order differential equation:\n\nand can be solved exactly (at least in theory).\n\nThe method is easily generalized to higher order equations.\n\nGeneralized Wronskians\n\nFor  functions of several variables, a generalized Wronskian is a determinant of an  by  matrix with entries  (with ), where each  is some constant coefficient linear partial differential operator of order . If the functions are linearly dependent then all generalized Wronskians vanish. As in the 1 variable case the converse is not true in general: if all generalized Wronskians vanish, this does not imply that the functions are linearly dependent. However, the converse is true in many special cases. For example, if the functions are polynomials and all generalized Wronskians vanish, then the functions are linearly dependent. Roth used this result about generalized Wronskians in his proof of Roth's theorem.

{"title": "Alessandro Padoa", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Padoa", "text": "Alessandro Padoa (14 October 1868 \u2013 25 November 1937) was an Italian mathematician and logician, a contributor to the school of Giuseppe Peano.  He is remembered for a method for deciding whether, given some formal theory, a new primitive notion is truly independent of the other primitive notions. There is an analogous problem in axiomatic theories, namely deciding whether a given axiom is independent of the other axioms.\n\nThe following description of Padoa's career is included in a biography of Peano:\nHe attended secondary school in Venice, engineering school in Padua, and the University of Turin, from which he received a degree in mathematics in 1895. Although he was never a student of Peano, he was an ardent disciple and, from 1896 on, a collaborator and friend. He taught in secondary schools in Pinerolo, Rome, Cagliari, and (from 1909) at the Technical Institute in Genoa. He also held positions at the Normal School in Aquila and the Naval School in Genoa, and, beginning in 1898, he gave a series of lectures at the Universities of Brussels, Pavia, Berne, Padua, Cagliari, and Geneva. He gave papers at congresses of philosophy and mathematics in Paris, Cambridge, Livorno, Parma, Padua, and Bologna. In 1934 he was awarded the ministerial prize in mathematics by the Accademia dei Lincei (Rome).Kennedy (1980), page 86\n\nThe congresses in Paris in 1900 were particularly notable. Padoa's addresses at these congresses have been well remembered for their clear and unconfused exposition of the modern axiomatic method in mathematics. In fact, he is said to be \"the first \u2026 to get all the ideas concerning defined and undefined concepts completely straight\".\n\nCongressional addresses\n\nPhilosophers' congress\nAt the International Congress of Philosophy Padoa spoke on \"Logical Introduction to Any Deductive Theory\". He says\nduring the period of elaboration of any deductive theory we choose the ideas to be represented by the undefined symbols and the facts to be stated by the unproved propositions; but, when we begin to formulate the theory, we can imagine that the undefined symbols are completely devoid of meaning and that the unproved propositions (instead of stating facts, that is, relations between the ideas represented by the undefined symbols) are simply conditions imposed upon undefined symbols.\nThen, the system of ideas that we have initially chosen is simply one interpretation of the system of undefined symbols; but from the deductive point of view this interpretation can be ignored by the reader, who is free to replace it in his mind by another interpretation that satisfies the conditions stated by the unproved propositions. And since the propositions, from the deductive point of view, do not state facts, but conditions, we cannot consider them genuine postulates.\nPadoa went on to say:\n...what is necessary to the logical development of a deductive theory is not the empirical knowledge of the properties of things, but the formal knowledge of relations between symbols.van Heijenoort 120,121\n\nMathematicians' congress\n\nPadoa spoke at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians with his title \"A New System of Definitions for Euclidean Geometry\". At the outset he discusses the various selections of primitive notions in geometry at the time:\nThe meaning of any of the symbols that one encounters in geometry must be presupposed, just as one presupposes that of the symbols which appear in pure logic. As there is an arbitrariness in the choice of the undefined symbols, it is necessary to describe the chosen system. We cite only three geometers who are concerned with this question and who have successively reduced the number of undefined symbols, and through them (as well as through symbols that appear in pure logic) it is possible to define all the other symbols.\nFirst, Moritz Pasch was able to define all the other symbols through the following four:\n1. point \u00a0 2. segment (of a line)\n3. plane \u00a0 4. is superimposable upon\nThen, Giuseppe Peano was able in 1889 to define plane through point and segment. In 1894 he replaced is superimposable upon with motion in the system of undefined symbols, thus reducing the system to symbols:\n1. point \u00a0 2. segment \u00a0 3. motion\nFinally, in 1899 Mario Pieri was able to define segment through point and motion. Consequently, all the symbols that one encounters in Euclidean geometry can be defined in terms of only two of them, namely\n 1. point \u00a0 2. motion\nPadoa completed his address by suggesting and demonstrating his own development of geometric concepts. In particular, he showed how he and Pieri define a line in terms of \ncollinear points.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n A.

{"title": "Axiom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom", "text": "An axiom or postulate is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Greek ax\u00ed\u014dma () 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident.'Cf. axiom, n., etymology. Oxford English Dictionary, accessed 2012-04-28.Oxford American College Dictionary: \"n. a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. ORIGIN: late 15th cent.: ultimately from Greek axi\u014dma 'what is thought fitting,' from axios 'worthy.' HighBeam \n\nThe term has subtle differences in definition when used in the context of different fields of study. As defined in classic philosophy, an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question.\"A proposition that commends itself to general acceptance; a well-established or universally conceded principle; a maxim, rule, law\" axiom, n., definition 1a. Oxford English Dictionary Online, accessed 2012-04-28. Cf. Aristotle, Posterior Analytics I.2.72a18-b4. As used in modern logic, an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning.\"A proposition (whether true or false)\" axiom, n., definition 2. Oxford English Dictionary Online, accessed 2012-04-28. \n \nAs used in mathematics, the term axiom is used in two related but distinguishable senses: \"logical axioms\" and \"non-logical axioms\". Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define (e.g., (A and B) implies A), often shown in symbolic form, while non-logical axioms (e.g., ) are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as arithmetic). When used in the latter sense, \"axiom\", \"postulate\", and \"assumption\" may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory.  To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.\n\nAny axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived.  Whether it is meaningful (and, if so, what it means) for an axiom to be \"true\" is a subject of debate in the philosophy of mathematics.See for example  for a realist view.\n\nEtymology\nThe word axiom comes from the Greek word  (ax\u00ed\u014dma), a verbal noun from the verb  (axioein), meaning \"to deem worthy\", but also \"to require\", which in turn comes from  (\u00e1xios), meaning \"being in balance\", and hence \"having (the same) value (as)\", \"worthy\", \"proper\". Among the ancient Greek philosophers an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof.\n\nThe root meaning of the word postulate is to \"demand\"; for instance, Euclid demands that one agree that some things can be done, e.g. any two points can be joined by a straight line, etc.Wolff, P. Breakthroughs in Mathematics, 1963, New York: New American Library, pp\u00a047\u201348\n\nAncient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates. While commenting on Euclid's books, Proclus remarks that, \"Geminus held that this [4th] Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, since it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property.\"Heath, T. 1956. The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements. New York: Dover. p 200 Boethius translated 'postulate' as petitio and called the axioms  notiones communes but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept.\n\nHistorical development\n\nEarly Greeks\nThe logico-deductive method whereby conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments (syllogisms, rules of inference), was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become the core principle of modern mathematics. Tautologies excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed. Axioms and postulates are the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions (theorems, if we are talking about mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms axiom and postulate hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for Aristotle and Euclid.\n\nThe ancient Greeks considered geometry as just one of several sciences, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle's posterior analytics is a definitive exposition of the classical view.\n\nAn \"axiom\", in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.\n\nAt the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses which were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a postulate. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.Aristotle, Metaphysics Bk IV, Chapter 3, 1005b \"Physics also is a kind of Wisdom, but it is not the first kind. \u2013 And the attempts of some of those who discuss the terms on which truth should be accepted, are due to want of training in logic; for they should know these things already when they come to a special study, and not be inquiring into them while they are listening to lectures on it.\" W.D. Ross translation, in The Basic Works of Aristotle, ed. Richard McKeon, (Random House, New York, 1941)|date=June 2011\n\nThe classical approach is well-illustrated by Euclid's Elements, where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of \"common notions\" (very basic, self-evident assertions).\n\nPostulates\n It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any other point.\n It is possible to extend a line segment continuously in both directions.\n It is possible to describe a circle with any center and any radius.\n It is true that all right angles are equal to one another.\n (\"Parallel postulate\") It is true that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, intersect on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.\n\nCommon notions\n Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.\n If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.\n If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.\n Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.\n The whole is greater than the part.\n\nModern development\nA lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, propositions, theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for primitive notions, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. Alessandro Padoa, Mario Pieri, and Giuseppe Peano were pioneers in this movement.\n\nStructuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. field theory, group theory, topology, vector spaces) without any particular application in mind. The distinction between an \"axiom\" and a \"postulate\" disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts, hyperbolic geometry for example. We must simply be prepared to use labels like \"line\" and \"parallel\" with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.\n\nWhen mathematicians employ the field axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.\n\nIt is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are \"propositions that are regarded as true without proof.\" Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.\n\nModern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and mathematics itself can be regarded as a branch of logic. Frege, Russell, Poincar\u00e9, Hilbert, and G\u00f6del are some of the key figures in this development.\n\nIn the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any collection of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be consistent; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.\n\nIt was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization of Euclidean geometry, and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.\n\nIn a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on Cantor's set theory. Here the emergence of Russell's paradox, and similar antinomies of na\u00efve set theory raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.\n\nThe formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 G\u00f6del showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms (Peano's axioms, for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a corollary, G\u00f6del proved that the consistency of a theory like Peano arithmetic is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.\n\nIt is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of natural numbers, an infinite but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms for set theory. Furthermore, using techniques of forcing (Cohen) one can show that the continuum hypothesis (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics.\n\nOther sciences\nAxioms play a key role not only in mathematics, but also in other sciences, notably in theoretical physics. In particular, the monumental work of Isaac Newton is essentially based on Euclid's axioms, augmented by a postulate on the non-relation of spacetime and the physics taking place in it at any moment.\n\nIn 1905, Newton's axioms were replaced by those of Albert Einstein's special relativity, and later on by those of general relativity.\n\nAnother paper of Albert Einstein and coworkers (see EPR paradox), almost immediately contradicted by Niels Bohr, concerned the interpretation of quantum mechanics. This was in 1935. According to Bohr, this new theory should be probabilistic, whereas according to Einstein it should be deterministic. Notably, the underlying quantum mechanical theory, i.e. the set of \"theorems\" derived by it, seemed to be identical.  Einstein even assumed that it would be sufficient to add to quantum mechanics  \"hidden variables\" to enforce determinism. However,  thirty years later, in 1964, John Bell found a theorem, involving complicated optical correlations (see Bell inequalities), which yielded measurably different results using Einstein's axioms compared to using Bohr's axioms. And it took roughly another twenty years until an experiment of Alain Aspect got results in favour of Bohr's axioms, not Einstein's. (Bohr's axioms are simply: The theory should be probabilistic in the sense of the Copenhagen interpretation.)\n\nAs a consequence, it is not necessary to explicitly cite Einstein's axioms, the more so since they concern subtle points on the \"reality\" and \"locality\" of experiments.\n\nRegardless, the role of axioms in mathematics and in the above-mentioned sciences is different. In mathematics one neither \"proves\" nor \"disproves\" an axiom for a set of theorems; the point is simply that in the conceptual realm identified by the axioms, the theorems logically follow. In contrast, in physics a comparison with experiments always makes sense, since a falsified physical theory needs modification.\n\nMathematical logic\nIn the field of mathematical logic, a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: logical and non-logical (somewhat similar to the ancient distinction between \"axioms\" and \"postulates\" respectively).\n\nLogical axioms\nThese are certain formulas in a formal language that are universally valid, that is, formulas that are satisfied by every assignment of values.  Usually one takes as logical axioms at least some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all tautologies in the language; in the case of predicate logic more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove logical truths that are not tautologies in the strict sense.\n\nExamples\n\nPropositional logic\nIn propositional logic it is common to take as logical axioms all formulae of the following forms, where , , and  can be any formulae of the language and where the included primitive connectives are only \"\" for negation of the immediately following proposition and \"\" for implication from antecedent to consequent propositions:\n\nEach of these patterns is an axiom schema, a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.  For example, if , , and  are propositional variables, then  and  are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.  It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and modus ponens, one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.  It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with modus ponens.\n\nOther axiom schemata involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed.Mendelson, \"6. Other Axiomatizations\" of Ch. 1\n\nThese axiom schemata are also used in the predicate calculus, but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus.Mendelson, \"3. First-Order Theories\" of Ch. 2\n\nFirst-order logic\nAxiom of Equality. Let  be a first-order language. For each variable , the formula\n\nis universally valid.\n\nThis means that, for any variable symbol  the formula  can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of \"primitive notions\", either a precise notion of what we mean by   (or, for that matter, \"to be equal\") has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol   has to be enforced, only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols, and mathematical logic does indeed do that.\n\nAnother, more interesting example axiom scheme, is that which provides us with what is known as Universal Instantiation:\n\nAxiom scheme for Universal Instantiation. Given a formula  in a first-order language , a variable  and a term  that is substitutable for  in , the formula\n\nis universally valid.\n\nWhere the symbol  stands for the formula  with the term  substituted for . (See Substitution of variables.) In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property  holds for every  and that  stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim . Again, we are claiming that the formula  is valid, that is, we must be able to give a \"proof\" of this fact, or more properly speaking, a metaproof. Actually, these examples are metatheorems of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of proof itself. Aside from this, we can also have Existential Generalization:\n\nAxiom scheme for Existential Generalization. Given a formula  in a first-order language , a variable  and a term  that is substitutable for  in , the formula\n\nis universally valid.\n\nNon-logical axioms\nNon-logical axioms are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.  Reasoning about two different structures, for example the natural numbers and the integers, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as groups).  Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not tautologies.  Another name for a non-logical axiom is postulate.Mendelson, \"3. First-Order Theories: Proper Axioms\" of Ch. 2\n\nAlmost every modern mathematical theory starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas.\n\nNon-logical axioms are often simply referred to as axioms in mathematical discourse.  This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.  For example, in some groups, the group operation is commutative, and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.\n\nThus, an axiom is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the rules of inference define a deductive system.\n\nExamples\nThis section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.\n\nBasic theories, such as arithmetic, real analysis and complex analysis are often introduced non-axiomatically, but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with choice, abbreviated ZFC, or some very similar system of axiomatic set theory like Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory, a conservative extension of ZFC. Sometimes slightly stronger theories such as Morse\u2013Kelley set theory or set theory with a strongly inaccessible cardinal allowing the use of a Grothendieck universe are used, but in fact most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than ZFC, such as second-order arithmetic.\n\nThe study of topology in mathematics extends all over through point set topology, algebraic topology, differential topology, and all the related paraphernalia, such as homology theory, homotopy theory. The development of abstract algebra brought with itself group theory, rings, fields, and Galois theory.\n\nThis list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including measure theory, ergodic theory, probability, representation theory, and differential geometry.\n\nArithmetic\nThe Peano axioms are the most widely used axiomatization of first-order arithmetic.  They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about number theory and they allowed G\u00f6del to establish his famous second incompleteness theorem.Mendelson, \"5. The Fixed Point Theorem. G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem\" of Ch. 2\n\nWe have a language  where  is a constant symbol and  is a unary function and the following axioms:\n\n \n \n  for any  formula  with one free variable.\n\nThe standard structure is  where  is the set of natural numbers,  is the successor function and  is naturally interpreted as the number 0.\n\nEuclidean geometry\nProbably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 Euclid's postulates of plane geometry.  The axioms are referred to as \"4 + 1\" because for nearly two millennia the fifth (parallel) postulate (\"through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel\") was suspected of being derivable from the first four.  Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four.  Indeed, one can assume that exactly one parallel through a point outside a line exists, or that infinitely many exist.  This choice gives us two alternative forms of geometry in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to exactly 180 degrees or less, respectively, and are known as Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries. If one also removes the second postulate (\"a line can be extended indefinitely\") then elliptic geometry arises, where there is no parallel through a point outside a line, and in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees.\n\nReal analysis\nThe objectives of study are within the domain of real numbers.  The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to isomorphism) by the properties of a Dedekind complete ordered field, meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of second-order logic. The L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorems tell us that if we restrict ourselves to first-order logic, any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.  Some of the latter are studied in non-standard analysis.\n\nRole in mathematical logic\n\nDeductive systems and completeness\nA deductive system consists of a set  of logical axioms, a set  of non-logical axioms, and a set  of rules of inference.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be complete.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas ,\n\nthat is, for any statement that is a logical consequence of  there actually exists a deduction of the statement from .  This is sometimes expressed as \"everything that is true is provable\", but it must be understood that \"true\" here means \"made true by the set of axioms\", and not, for example, \"true in the intended interpretation\". G\u00f6del's completeness theorem establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.\n\nNote that \"completeness\" has a different meaning here than it does in the context of G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem, which states that no recursive, consistent set of non-logical axioms  of the Theory of Arithmetic is complete, in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement  such that neither  nor  can be proved from the given set of axioms.\n\nThere is thus, on the one hand, the notion of completeness of a deductive system and on the other hand that of completeness of a set of non-logical axioms.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.\n\nFurther discussion\nEarly mathematicians regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of physical space, and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as Boolean algebra made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. Galois showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and modern algebra was born.  In the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.\n\nSee also\n\n Axiomatic system\n Dogma\n First principle, axiom in science and philosophy\n List of axioms\n Model theory\n Regul\u00e6 Juris\n Theorem\n Presupposition\n Physical law\n Principle\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Mendelson, Elliot (1987).

Continuum theory is the branch of topology devoted to the study of continua.\n\n Definitions \n\n A continuum that contains more than one point is called nondegenerate.\n A subset A of a continuum X such that A itself is a continuum is called a subcontinuum of X. A space homeomorphic to a subcontinuum of the Euclidean plane R2 is called a planar continuum.\n A continuum X is homogeneous if for every two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism h: X \u2192 X such that h(x) = y.\n A Peano continuum is a continuum that is locally connected at each point.\n An indecomposable continuum is a continuum that cannot be represented as the union of two proper subcontinua. A continuum X is hereditarily indecomposable if every subcontinuum of X is indecomposable.\n The dimension of a continuum usually means its topological dimension. A one-dimensional continuum is often called a curve.\n\n Examples \n\n An arc is a space homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1]. If h: [0,1] \u2192 X is a homeomorphism and h(0) = p and h(1) = q then p and q are called the endpoints of X; one also says that X is an arc from p to q. An arc is the simplest and most familiar type of a continuum. It is one-dimensional, arcwise connected, and locally connected.\n The topologist's sine curve is a subset of the plane that is the union of the graph of the function f(x) = sin(1/x), 0 < x \u2264 1 with the segment \u22121 \u2264 y \u2264 1 of the y-axis. It is a one-dimensional continuum that is not arcwise connected, and it is locally disconnected at the points along the y-axis.\n The Warsaw circle is obtained by \"closing up\" the topologist's sine curve by an arc connecting (0,\u22121) and (1,sin(1)). It is a one-dimensional continuum whose homotopy groups are all trivial, but it is not a contractible space. \nthumbnail|Warsaw circle\n\n An  n-cell is a space homeomorphic to the closed ball in the Euclidean space Rn. It is contractible and is the simplest example of an n-dimensional continuum.\n  An  n-sphere is a space homeomorphic to the standard n-sphere in the (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space. It is an n-dimensional homogeneous continuum that is not contractible, and therefore different from an n-cell.\n The Hilbert cube is an infinite-dimensional continuum.\n Solenoids are among the simplest examples of indecomposable homogeneous continua. They are neither arcwise connected nor locally connected.\n The Sierpinski carpet, also known as the Sierpinski universal curve, is a one-dimensional planar Peano continuum that contains a homeomorphic image of any one-dimensional planar continuum.\n The pseudo-arc is a homogeneous hereditarily indecomposable planar continuum.\n\n Properties \n\nThere are two fundamental techniques for constructing continua, by means of nested intersections and inverse limits.\n\n If {Xn} is a nested family of continua, i.e. Xn \u2287 Xn+1, then their intersection is a continuum.\n\n If {(Xn, fn)} is an inverse sequence of continua Xn, called the coordinate spaces, together with continuous maps fn: Xn+1 \u2192 Xn, called the bonding maps, then its inverse limit is a continuum.\n\nA finite or countable product of continua is a continuum.\n\n See also \n Linear continuum\n Menger sponge\n Shape theory (mathematics)\n\n References \n\n Sources \n Sam B.

{"title": "Definition", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition", "text": "thumb|right|340px|A definition states the meaning of a word using other words. This is sometimes challenging. Common dictionaries contain lexical descriptive definitions but there are various types of definition - all with different purposes and focuses.\n\nA definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols).Bickenbach, Jerome E., and Jacqueline M. Davies. Good reasons for better arguments: An introduction to the skills and values of critical thinking. Broadview Press, 1996. p. 49 Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the sense of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes).Lyons, John. \"Semantics, vol. I.\" Cambridge: Cambridge (1977). p.158 and on. Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.Dooly, Melinda. Semantics and Pragmatics of English: Teaching English as a Foreign Language. Univ. Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, 2006. p.48 and on\n\nIn mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, instead of describing a pre-existing term. Definitions and axioms are the basis on which all of modern mathematics is constructed.Richard J. Rossi\n (2011) Theorems, Corollaries, Lemmas, and Methods of Proof. John Wiley & Sons p.4\n\nBasic terminology\n\nIn modern usage, a definition is something, typically expressed in words, that attaches a meaning to a word or group of words. The word or group of words that is to be defined is called the definiendum, and the word, group of words, or action that defines it is called the definiens. In the definition \"An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa\", the word \"elephant\" is the definiendum, and everything after the word \"is\" is the definiens.\n\nThe definiens is not the meaning of the word defined, but is instead something that conveys the same meaning as that word.\n\nThere are many sub-types of definitions, often specific to a given field of knowledge or study. These include, among many others, lexical definitions, or the common dictionary definitions of words already in a language; demonstrative definitions, which define something by pointing to an example of it (\"This,\" [said while pointing to a large grey animal], \"is an Asian elephant.\"); and precising definitions, which reduce the vagueness of a word, typically in some special sense (\"'Large', among female Asian elephants, is any individual weighing over 5,500 pounds.\").\n\nIntensional definitions vs extensional definitions\n\nAn intensional definition, also called a connotative definition, specifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing being a member of a specific set. Any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something, such as that by genus and differentia, is an intensional definition.\n\nAn extensional definition, also called a denotative definition, of a concept or term specifies its extension. It is a list naming every object that is a member of a specific set.\n\nThus, the \"seven deadly sins\" can be defined intensionally as those singled out by Pope Gregory I as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation. An extensional definition would be the list of wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. In contrast, while an intensional definition of \"Prime Minister\" might be \"the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system\", an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who future prime ministers will be.\n\nClasses of intensional definitions\n\nA genus\u2013differentia definition is a type of intensional definition that takes a large category (the genus) and narrows it down to a smaller category by a distinguishing characteristic (i.e. the differentia).Bussler, Christoph, and Dieter Fensel, eds. Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems and Applications: 11th International Conference, AIMSA 2004: Proceedings. Springer-Verlag, 2004. p.6\n\nMore formally, a genus-differentia definition consists of:\n a genus (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.\n the differentia: The portion of the new definition that is not provided by the genus.\n\nFor example, consider the following genus-differentia definitions:\n a triangle: A plane figure that has three straight bounding sides.\n a quadrilateral: A plane figure that has four straight bounding sides.\n\nThose definitions can be expressed as a genus (\"a plane figure\") and two differentiae (\"that has three straight bounding sides\" and \"that has four straight bounding sides\", respectively).\n\nIt is possible to have two different genus-differentia definitions that describe the same term, especially when the term describes the overlap of two large categories. For instance, both of these genus-differentia definitions of \"square\" are equally acceptable:\n a square: a rectangle that is a rhombus.\n a square: a rhombus that is a rectangle.\n\nThus, a \"square\" is a member of both the genus \"rectangle\" and the genus \"rhombus\".\n\nClasses of extensional definitions\nOne important form of the extensional definition is ostensive definition. This gives the meaning of a term by pointing, in the case of an individual, to the thing itself, or in the case of a class, to examples of the right kind. So one can explain who Alice (an individual) is by pointing her out to another; or what a rabbit (a class) is by pointing at several and expecting another to understand. The process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by Ludwig Wittgenstein.Philosophical investigations, Part 1 \u00a727\u201334\n\nAn enumerative definition of a concept or term is an extensional definition that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the objects that fall under the concept or term in question. Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets.\n\nDivisio and partitio\nDivisio and partitio are classical terms for definitions. A partitio is simply an intensional definition. A divisio is not an extensional definition, but an exhaustive list of subsets of a set, in the sense that every member of the \"divided\" set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of divisio lists all sets whose only member is a member of the \"divided\" set. The difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list members, and not subsets.Katerina Ierodiakonou, \"The Stoic Division of Philosophy\", in Phronesis: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy, Volume 38, Number 1, 1993, pp. 57\u201374.\n\nNominal definitions vs real definitions\n\nIn classical thought, a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing. Aristotle had it that an object's essential attributes form its \"essential nature\", and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes.Posterior Analytics, Bk 1 c. 4\n\nThe idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between nominal and real essence, originating with Aristotle. In a passage from the Posterior Analytics,Posterior Analytics Bk 2 c. 7 he says that the meaning of a made-up name can be known (he gives the example \"goat stag\"), without knowing what he calls the \"essential nature\" of the thing that the name would denote, if there were such a thing. This led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the quid nominis or \"whatness of the name\", and the underlying nature common to all the things it names, which they called the quid rei or \"whatness of the thing\". (Early modern philosophers like Locke used the corresponding English terms \"nominal essence\" and \"real essence\"). The name \"hobbit\", for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a quid nominis. But one could not know the real nature of hobbits, and so the real nature or quid rei of hobbits cannot be known. By contrast, the name \"man\" denotes real things (men) that have a certain quid rei. The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that thing must have in order that the name apply to it.\n\nThis leads to a corresponding distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means, i.e. which says what the \"nominal essence\" is, and is definition in the classical sense as given above. A real definition, by contrast, is one expressing the real nature or quid rei of the thing.\n\nThis preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy. Analytic philosophy in particular is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing. Russell described essence as \"a hopelessly muddle-headed notion\".A history of Western Philosophy, p. 210\n\nMore recently Kripke's formalisation of possible world semantics in modal logic led to a new approach to essentialism. Insofar as the essential properties of a thing are necessary to it, they are those things it possesses in all possible worlds. Kripke refers to names used in this way as rigid designators.\n\nOperational Versus Theoretical Definitions\nA definition may also be classified as an operational definition or theoretical definition.\n\nTerms with multiple definitions\n\nHomonyms\n\nA homonym is, in the strict sense, one of a group of words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different  meanings.homonym, Random House Unabridged Dictionary at dictionary.com  Thus homonyms are simultaneously homographs (words that share the same spelling, regardless of their pronunciation) and homophones (words that share the same pronunciation, regardless of their spelling).  The state of being a homonym is called homonymy. Examples of homonyms are the pair stalk (part of a plant) and stalk (follow/harass a person) and the pair left (past tense of leave) and left (opposite of right).  A distinction is sometimes made between \"true\" homonyms, which are unrelated in origin, such as skate (glide on ice) and skate (the fish), and polysemous homonyms, or polysemes, which have a shared origin, such as mouth (of a river) and mouth (of an animal).Semantics: a coursebook, p. 123, James R. Hurford and Brendan Heasley, Cambridge University Press, 1983\n\nPolysemes\n\nPolysemy  is the capacity for a sign (such as a word, phrase, or symbol) to have multiple meanings (that is, multiple semes or sememes and thus multiple senses), usually related by contiguity of meaning within a semantic field. It is thus usually regarded as distinct from homonymy, in which the multiple meanings of a word may be unconnected or unrelated.\n\nIn logic and mathematics\nIn mathematics, definitions are generally not used to describe existing terms, but to describe or characterize a concept.David Hunter (2010) Essentials of Discrete Mathematics. Jones & Bartlett Publishers, Section 14.1 For naming the object of a definition mathematicians can use either a neologism (this was mainly the case in the past) or words or phrases of the common language (this is generally the case in modern mathematics). The precise meaning of a term given by a mathematical definition is often different than the English definition of the word used,Kevin Houston (2009) How to Think Like a Mathematician: A Companion to Undergraduate Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, p. 104 which can lead to confusion, particularly when the meanings are close. For example a set is not exactly the same thing in mathematics and in common language. In some case, the word used can be misleading; for example, a real number has nothing more (or less) real than an imaginary number.  Frequently, a definition use a phrase built with common English words, which has no meaning outside mathematics, such as primitive group or irreducible variety. \n\nClassification\nAuthors have used different terms to classify definitions used in formal languages like mathematics.  Norman Swartz classifies a definition as \"stipulative\" if it is intended to guide a specific discussion.   A stipulative definition might be considered a temporary, working definition, and can only be disproved by showing a logical contradiction. In contrast, a \"descriptive\" definition can be shown to be \"right\" or \"wrong\" with reference to general usage.\n\nSwartz defines a precising definition as one that extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) for a specific purpose by including additional criteria. A precising definition narrows the set of things that meet the definition.\n\nC.L. Stevenson has identified persuasive definition as a form of stipulative definition which purports to state the \"true\" or \"commonly accepted\" meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an altered use (perhaps as an argument for some specific belief). Stevenson has also noted that some definitions are \"legal\" or \"coercive\"\u00a0\u2013 their object is to create or alter rights, duties, or crimes.Stevenson, C.L., Ethics and Language, Connecticut 1944\n\nRecursive definitions\nA recursive definition, sometimes also called an inductive definition, is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way. Normally this consists of three steps:\n At least one thing is stated to be a member of the set being defined; this is sometimes called a \"base set\".\n All things bearing a certain relation to other members of the set are also to count as members of the set. It is this step that makes the definition recursive.\n All other things are excluded from the set\n\nFor instance, we could define a natural number as follows (after Peano): \n \"0\" is a natural number.\n Each natural number has a unique successor, such that:\n the successor of a natural number is also a natural number;\n distinct natural numbers have distinct successors;\n no natural number is succeeded by \"0\".\n Nothing else is a natural number.\n\nSo \"0\" will have exactly one successor, which for convenience can be called \"1\". In turn, \"1\" will have exactly one successor, which could be called \"2\", and so on. Notice that the second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves self-reference. Although this sort of definition involves a form of circularity, it is not vicious, and the definition has been quite successful.\n\nIn the same way, we can define ancestor as follows:\nA parent is an ancestor.\nA parent of an ancestor is an ancestor.\nNothing else is an ancestor.\nOr simply: an ancestor is a parent or a parent of an ancestor.\n\nIn medicine\nIn medical dictionaries, guidelines and other consensus statements and classifications, definitions should as far as possible be:\nsimple and easy to understand, preferably even by the general public;\nuseful clinically or in related areas where the definition will be used;\nspecific (that is, by reading the definition only, it should ideally not be possible to refer to any other entity than that being defined);\nmeasurable;\na reflection of current scientific knowledge.\n\nIssues with definitions\n\nFallacies of definition\n\nCertain rules have traditionally been given for definitions (in particular, genus-differentia definitions).Copi 1982 pp 165\u2013169Joyce, Ch. XJoseph, Ch. VMacagno & Walton 2014, Ch. III\nA definition must set out the essential attributes of the thing defined.\nDefinitions should avoid circularity. To define a horse as \"a member of the species equus\" would convey no information whatsoever. For this reason, Locking adds that a definition of a term must not consist of terms which are synonymous with it. This would be a circular definition, a circulus in definiendo. Note, however, that it is acceptable to define two relative terms in respect of each other. Clearly, we cannot define \"antecedent\" without using the term \"consequent\", nor conversely.\nThe definition must not be too wide or too narrow. It must be applicable to everything to which the defined term applies (i.e. not miss anything out), and to nothing else (i.e. not include any things to which the defined term would not truly apply).\nThe definition must not be obscure. The purpose of a definition is to explain the meaning of a term which may be obscure or difficult, by the use of terms that are commonly understood and whose meaning is clear. The violation of this rule is known by the Latin term obscurum per obscurius. However, sometimes scientific and philosophical terms are difficult to define without obscurity.\nA definition should not be negative where it can be positive. We should not define \"wisdom\" as the absence of folly, or a healthy thing as whatever is not sick. Sometimes this is unavoidable, however. For example, it appears difficult to define blindness in positive terms rather than as \"the absence of sight in a creature that is normally sighted\".\n\nLimitations of definition\nGiven that a natural language such as English contains, at any given time, a finite number of words, any comprehensive list of definitions must either be circular or rely upon primitive notions. If every term of every definiens must itself be defined, \"where at last should we stop?\"Locke, Essay, Bk. III, Ch. iv, 5This problem parallels the diallelus, but leads to scepticism about meaning rather than knowledge. A dictionary, for instance, insofar as it is a comprehensive list of lexical definitions, must resort to circularity.Generally lexicographers seek to avoid circularity wherever possible, but the definitions of words such as \"the\" and \"a\" use those words and are therefore circular.   Lexicographer Sidney I. Landau's essay \"Sexual Intercourse in American College Dictionaries\" provides other examples of circularity in dictionary definitions. (McKean, p. 73\u201377)An exercise suggested by J. L. Austin involved taking up a dictionary and finding a selection of terms relating to the key concept, then looking up each of the words in the explanation of their meaning. Then, iterating this process until the list of words begins to repeat, closing in a \"family circle\" of words relating to the key concept.(A plea for excuses in Philosophical Papers. Ed. J. O. Urmson and G. J. Warnock. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1961. 1979.)In the game of Vish, players compete to find circularity in a dictionary.\n\nMany philosophers have chosen instead to leave some terms undefined. The scholastic philosophers claimed that the highest genera (called the ten generalissima) cannot be defined, since a higher genus cannot be assigned under which they may fall. Thus being, unity and similar concepts cannot be defined. Locke supposes in An Essay Concerning Human UnderstandingLocke, Essay, Bk. III, Ch. iv that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition. More recently Bertrand Russell sought to develop a formal language based on logical atoms. Other philosophers, notably Wittgenstein, rejected the need for any undefined simples. Wittgenstein pointed out in his Philosophical Investigations that what counts as a \"simple\" in one circumstance might not do so in another.See especially Philosophical Investigations Part 1 \u00a748 He rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained: \"As though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one\",He continues: \"Whereas an explanation may indeed rest on another one that has been given, but none stands in need of another\u00a0\u2013 unless we require it to prevent a misunderstanding. One might say: an explanation serves to remove or to avert a misunderstanding\u00a0\u2013 one, that is, that would occur but for the explanation; not every one I can imagine.\" Philosophical Investigations, Part 1 \u00a787, italics in original claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed to avoid misunderstanding.\n\nLocke and Mill also argued that individuals cannot be defined. Names are learned by connecting an idea with a sound, so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used.This theory of meaning is one of the targets of the private language argument This is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has \"fallen under our notice\".Locke, Essay, Bk. III, Ch. iii, 3 Russell offered his theory of descriptions in part as a way of defining a proper name, the definition being given by a definite description that \"picks out\" exactly one individual. Saul Kripke pointed to difficulties with this approach, especially in relation to modality, in his book Naming and Necessity.\n\nThere is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the definiens can be stated.

Heat is being generated internally in the casing and being cooled at the boundary, providing a steady state temperature distribution.\nA differential equation is a mathematical equation that relates some function with its derivatives. In applications, the functions usually represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. Because such relations are extremely common, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, economics, and biology.\n\nIn pure mathematics, differential equations are studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions\u2014the set of functions that satisfy the equation. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas; however, some properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form.\n\nIf a closed-form expression for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.\n\nHistory\n\nDifferential equations first came into existence with the invention of calculus by Newton and Leibniz. In Chapter 2 of his 1671 work Methodus fluxionum et Serierum Infinitarum,Newton, Isaac. (c.1671). Methodus Fluxionum et Serierum Infinitarum (The Method of Fluxions and Infinite Series), published in 1736 [Opuscula, 1744, Vol. I. p. 66]. Isaac Newton listed three kinds of differential equations:\n\nIn all these cases,  is an unknown function of  (or of  and ), and  is a given function.\n\nHe solves these examples and others using infinite series and discusses the non-uniqueness of solutions.\n\nJacob Bernoulli proposed the Bernoulli differential equation in 1695. This is an ordinary differential equation of the form\n\n \n\nfor which the following year Leibniz obtained solutions by simplifying it.\n\nHistorically, the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange.  (retrieved 13 Nov 2012).For a special collection of the 9 groundbreaking papers by the three authors, see First Appearance of the wave equation: D'Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli. - the controversy about vibrating strings (retrieved 13 Nov 2012). Herman HJ Lynge and Son.For de Lagrange's contributions to the acoustic wave equation, can consult Acoustics: An Introduction to Its Physical Principles and Applications Allan D. Pierce, Acoustical Soc of America, 1989; page 18.(retrieved 9 Dec 2012) In 1746, d\u2019Alembert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation.Speiser, David. Discovering the Principles of Mechanics 1600-1800, p. 191 (Basel: Birkh\u00e4user, 2008).\n\nThe Euler\u2013Lagrange equation was developed in the 1750s by Euler and Lagrange in connection with their studies of the tautochrone problem. This is the problem of determining a curve on which a weighted particle will fall to a fixed point in a fixed amount of time, independent of the starting point. Lagrange solved this problem in 1755 and sent the solution to Euler. Both further developed Lagrange's method and applied it to mechanics, which led to the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics.\n\nIn 1822, Fourier published his work on heat flow in Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur (The Analytic Theory of Heat), in which he based his reasoning on Newton's law of cooling, namely, that the flow of heat between two adjacent molecules is proportional to the extremely small difference of their temperatures. Contained in this book was Fourier's proposal of his heat equation for conductive diffusion of heat. This partial differential equation is now taught to every student of mathematical physics.\n\nExample\nFor example, in classical mechanics, the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. Newton's laws allow these variables to be expressed dynamically (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time.\n\nIn some cases, this differential equation (called an equation of motion) may be solved explicitly.\n\nAn example of modelling a real world problem using differential equations is the determination of the velocity of a ball falling through the air, considering only gravity and air resistance. The ball's acceleration towards the ground is the acceleration due to gravity minus the acceleration due to air resistance. Gravity is considered constant, and air resistance may be modeled as proportional to the ball's velocity. This means that the ball's acceleration, which is a derivative of its velocity, depends on the velocity (and the velocity depends on time). Finding the velocity as a function of time involves solving a differential equation and verifying its validity.\n\nTypes\nDifferential equations can be divided into several types. Apart from describing the properties of the equation itself, these classes of differential equations can help inform the choice of approach to a solution. Commonly used distinctions include whether the equation is: Ordinary/Partial, Linear/Non-linear, and Homogeneous/Inhomogeneous. This list is far from exhaustive; there are many other properties and subclasses of differential equations which can be very useful in specific contexts.\n\nOrdinary differential equations\n\nAn ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation containing an unknown function of one real or complex variable , its derivatives, and some given functions of . The unknown function is generally represented by a variable (often denoted ), which, therefore, depends on . Thus  is often called the independent variable of the equation. The term \"ordinary\" is used in contrast with the term partial differential equation, which may be with respect to more than one independent variable.\n\nLinear differential equations are the differential equations that are linear in the unknown function and its derivatives. Their theory is well developed, and, in many cases, one may express their solutions in terms of integrals.\n\nMost ODEs that are encountered in physics are linear, and, therefore, most special functions may be defined as solutions of linear differential equations (see Holonomic function).\n\nAs, in general, the solutions of a differential equation cannot be expressed by a closed-form expression, numerical methods are commonly used for solving differential equations on a computer.\n\nPartial differential equations\n\nA partial differential equation (PDE) is a differential equation that contains unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivatives. (This is in contrast to ordinary differential equations, which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives.) PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved in closed form, or used to create a relevant computer model.\n\nPDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena in nature such as sound, heat, electrostatics, electrodynamics, fluid flow, elasticity, or quantum mechanics. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional dynamical systems, partial differential equations often model multidimensional systems. PDEs find their generalisation in stochastic partial differential equations.\n\nNon-linear differential equations\n\nA non-linear differential equation is a differential equation that is not a linear equation in the unknown function and its derivatives (the linearity or non-linearity in the arguments of the function are not considered here). There are very few methods of solving nonlinear differential equations exactly; those that are known typically depend on the equation having particular symmetries. Nonlinear differential equations can exhibit very complicated behavior over extended time intervals, characteristic of chaos. Even the fundamental questions of existence, uniqueness, and extendability of solutions for nonlinear differential equations, and well-posedness of initial and boundary value problems for nonlinear PDEs are hard problems and their resolution in special cases is considered to be a significant advance in the mathematical theory (cf. Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness). However, if the differential equation is a correctly formulated representation of a meaningful physical process, then one expects it to have a solution.\n\nLinear differential equations frequently appear as approximations to nonlinear equations. These approximations are only valid under restricted conditions. For example, the harmonic oscillator equation is an approximation to the nonlinear pendulum equation that is valid for small amplitude oscillations (see below).\n\n Equation order\nDifferential equations are described by their order, determined by the term with the highest derivatives. An equation containing only first derivatives is a first-order differential equation, an equation containing the second derivative is a second-order differential equation, and so on.Weisstein, Eric W. \"Ordinary Differential Equation Order.\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrdinaryDifferentialEquationOrder.htmlOrder and degree of a differential equation, accessed Dec 2015. Differential equations that describe natural phenomena almost always have only first and second order derivatives in them, but there are some exceptions, such as the thin film equation, which is a fourth order partial differential equation.\n\nExamples\n\nIn the first group of examples, u is an unknown function of x, and c and \u03c9 are constants that are supposed to be known. Two broad classifications of both ordinary and partial differential equations consists of distinguishing between linear and nonlinear differential equations, and between homogeneous differential equations and inhomogeneous ones.\n\n Inhomogeneous first-order linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equation:\n\n \n\n Homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n\n \n\n Homogeneous second-order linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equation describing the harmonic oscillator:\n\n \n\n Inhomogeneous first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation:\n\n \n\n Second-order nonlinear (due to sine function) ordinary differential equation describing the motion of a pendulum of length L:\n\n \n\nIn the next group of examples, the unknown function u depends on two variables x and t or x and y.\n\n Homogeneous first-order linear partial differential equation:\n\n \n\n Homogeneous second-order linear constant coefficient partial differential equation of elliptic type, the Laplace equation:\n\n \n\n Homogeneous third-order non-linear partial differential equation :\n\n \n\nExistence of solutions\n\nSolving differential equations is not like solving algebraic equations. Not only are their solutions often unclear, but whether solutions are unique or exist at all are also notable subjects of interest.\n\nFor first order initial value problems, the Peano existence theorem gives one set of circumstances in which a solution exists. Given any point  in the xy-plane, define some rectangular region , such that  and  is in the interior of . If we are given a differential equation  and the condition that  when , then there is locally a solution to this problem if  and  are both continuous on . This solution exists on some interval with its center at . The solution may not be unique. (See Ordinary differential equation for other results.)\n\nHowever, this only helps us with first order initial value problems. Suppose we had a linear initial value problem of the nth order:\n\nsuch that\n\nFor any nonzero , if  and  are continuous on some interval containing ,  is unique and exists.\n\nRelated concepts\n\n A delay differential equation (DDE) is an equation for a function of a single variable, usually called time, in which the derivative of the function at a certain time is given in terms of the values of the function at earlier times.\n A stochastic differential equation (SDE) is an equation in which the unknown quantity is a stochastic process and the equation involves some known stochastic processes, for example, the Wiener process in the case of diffusion equations.\n A differential algebraic equation (DAE) is a differential equation comprising differential and algebraic terms, given in implicit form.\n\nConnection to difference equations\n\nThe theory of differential equations is closely related to the theory of difference equations, in which the coordinates assume only discrete values, and the relationship involves values of the unknown function or functions and values at nearby coordinates. Many methods to compute numerical solutions of differential equations or study the properties of differential equations involve the approximation of the solution of a differential equation by the solution of a corresponding difference equation.\n\nApplications\n\nThe study of differential equations is a wide field in pure and applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. All of these disciplines are concerned with the properties of differential equations of various types. Pure mathematics focuses on the existence and uniqueness of solutions, while applied mathematics emphasizes the rigorous justification of the methods for approximating solutions. Differential equations play an important role in modelling virtually every physical, technical, or biological process, from celestial motion, to bridge design, to interactions between neurons. Differential equations such as those used to solve real-life problems may not necessarily be directly solvable, i.e. do not have closed form solutions. Instead, solutions can be approximated using numerical methods.\n\nMany fundamental laws of physics and chemistry can be formulated as differential equations. In biology and economics, differential equations are used to model the behavior of complex systems. The mathematical theory of differential equations first developed together with the sciences where the equations had originated and where the results found application. However, diverse problems, sometimes originating in quite distinct scientific fields, may give rise to identical differential equations. Whenever this happens, mathematical theory behind the equations can be viewed as a unifying principle behind diverse phenomena. As an example, consider the propagation of light and sound in the atmosphere, and of waves on the surface of a pond. All of them may be described by the same second-order partial differential equation, the wave equation, which allows us to think of light and sound as forms of waves, much like familiar waves in the water. Conduction of heat, the theory of which was developed by Joseph Fourier, is governed by another second-order partial differential equation, the heat equation. It turns out that many diffusion processes, while seemingly different, are described by the same equation; the Black\u2013Scholes equation in finance is, for instance, related to the heat equation.\n\nPhysics\n\n Euler\u2013Lagrange equation in classical mechanics\n Hamilton's equations in classical mechanics\n Radioactive decay in nuclear physics\n Newton's law of cooling in thermodynamics\n The wave equation\n The heat equation in thermodynamics\n Laplace's equation, which defines harmonic functions\n Poisson's equation\n The geodesic equation\n The Navier\u2013Stokes equations in fluid dynamics\n The Diffusion equation in stochastic processes\n The Convection\u2013diffusion equation in fluid dynamics\n The Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations in complex analysis\n The Poisson\u2013Boltzmann equation in molecular dynamics\n The shallow water equations\n Universal differential equation\n The Lorenz equations whose solutions exhibit chaotic flow.\n\nClassical mechanics\nSo long as the force acting on a particle is known, Newton's second law is sufficient to describe the motion of a particle. Once independent relations for each force acting on a particle are available, they can be substituted into Newton's second law to obtain an ordinary differential equation, which is called the equation of motion.\n\nElectrodynamics\nMaxwell's equations are a set of partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electrodynamics, classical optics, and electric circuits. These fields in turn underlie modern electrical and communications technologies. Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents. They are named after the Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell, who published an early form of those equations between 1861 and 1862.\n\nGeneral relativity\nThe Einstein field equations (EFE; also known as \"Einstein's equations\") are a set of ten partial differential equations in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity which describe the fundamental interaction of gravitation as a result of spacetime being curved by matter and energy. First published by Einstein in 1915 as a tensor equation, the EFE equate local spacetime curvature (expressed by the Einstein tensor) with the local energy and momentum within that spacetime (expressed by the stress\u2013energy tensor). Chapter 34, p. 916.\n\nQuantum mechanics\nIn quantum mechanics, the analogue of Newton's law is Schr\u00f6dinger's equation (a partial differential equation) for a quantum system (usually atoms, molecules, and subatomic particles whether free, bound, or localized). It is not a simple algebraic equation, but in general a linear partial differential equation, describing the time-evolution of the system's wave function (also called a \"state function\").\n\nBiology\nVerhulst equation \u2013 biological population growth\nvon Bertalanffy model \u2013 biological individual growth\nReplicator dynamics \u2013 found in theoretical biology\nHodgkin\u2013Huxley model \u2013 neural action potentials\n\nPredator-prey equations\nThe Lotka\u2013Volterra equations, also known as the predator\u2013prey equations, are a pair of first-order, non-linear, differential equations frequently used to describe the population dynamics of two species that interact, one as a predator and the other as prey.\n\nChemistry\nThe rate law or rate equation for a chemical reaction is a differential equation that links the reaction rate with concentrations or pressures of reactants and constant parameters (normally rate coefficients and partial reaction orders).IUPAC Gold Book definition of rate law.

{"title": "Euclidean geometry", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry", "text": "thumb|236px|Detail from Raphael's The School of Athens featuring a Greek mathematician \u2013\u00a0perhaps representing Euclid or Archimedes\u00a0\u2013 using a compass to draw a geometric construction.\n\nEuclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the Elements. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school (high school) as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.\n\nFor more than two thousand years, the adjective \"Euclidean\" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the parallel postulate) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. An implication of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and Euclidean space is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the  gravitational field).Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.\u00a047\n\nEuclidean geometry is an example of synthetic geometry, in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects, all without the use of coordinates to specify those objects. This is in contrast to analytic geometry, which uses coordinates to translate geometric propositions into algebraic formulas.\n\nThe Elements\n\nThe Elements is mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. Its improvement over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.\n\nThere are 13 books in the Elements:\n\nBooks I\u2013IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, for example \"In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.\" (Book 1 proposition 17) and the Pythagorean theorem \"In right angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.\" (Book I, proposition 47)\n\nBooks V and VII\u2013X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically as lengths of line segments or areas of regions. Notions such as prime numbers and rational and irrational numbers are introduced. It is proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nBooks XI\u2013XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base. The platonic solids are constructed.\n\nAxioms\nthumb|The parallel postulate (Postulate 5): If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.\n\nEuclidean geometry is an axiomatic system, in which all theorems (\"true statements\") are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of non-Euclidean geometry, these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true. However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independent of their physical reality.The assumptions of Euclid are discussed from a modern perspective in \n\nNear the beginning of the first book of the Elements, Euclid gives five postulates (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):tr. Heath, pp. 195\u2013202.\n\nLet the following be postulated:\n To draw a straight line from any point to any point.\n To produce (extend) a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.\n To describe a circle with any centre and distance (radius).\n That all right angles are equal to one another.\n [The parallel postulate]: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.\n\nAlthough Euclid only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructed objects, in his reasoning they are implicitly assumed to be unique.\n\nThe Elements also include the following five \"common notions\":\n\n Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another (the Transitive property of a Euclidean relation).\n If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal (Addition property of equality).\n If equals are subtracted from equals, then the differences are equal (Subtraction property of equality).\n Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another (Reflexive property).\n The whole is greater than the part.\n\nModern scholars agree that Euclid's postulates do not provide the complete logical foundation that Euclid required for his presentation. Modern treatments use more extensive and complete sets of axioms.\n\nParallel postulate\n\nTo the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They aspired to create a system of absolutely certain propositions, and to them it seemed as if the parallel line postulate required proof from simpler statements. It is now known that such a proof is impossible, since one can construct consistent systems of geometry (obeying the other axioms) in which the parallel postulate is true, and others in which it is false. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the Elements: his first 28 propositions are those that can be proved without it.\n\nMany alternative axioms can be formulated which are logically equivalent to the parallel postulate (in the context of the other axioms). For example, Playfair's axiom states:\n\nIn a plane, through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.\n\nThe \"at most\" clause is all that is needed since it can be proved from the remaining axioms that at least one parallel line exists.\n\nthumb|A proof from Euclid's Elements that, given a line segment, one may construct an equilateral triangle that includes the segment as one of its sides: an equilateral triangle \u0391\u0392\u0393 is made by drawing circles \u0394 and \u0395 centered on the points \u0391 and \u0392, and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.\n\nMethods of proof\nEuclidean Geometry is constructive. Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a compass and an unmarked straightedge.Ball, p.\u00a056 In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as set theory, which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory.Within Euclid's assumptions, it is quite easy to give a formula for area of triangles and squares. However, in a more general context like set theory, it is not as easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of areas of its pieces, for example. See Lebesgue measure and Banach\u2013Tarski paradox. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are models of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example, a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Though nearly all modern mathematicians consider nonconstructive methods just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones\u2014e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs that involved irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as \"Find the greatest common measure of ...\"\n\nEuclid often used proof by contradiction. Euclidean geometry also allows the method of superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving one of the two triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.Coxeter, p.\u00a05\n\nSystem of measurement and arithmetic\nEuclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, for example, a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.\n\nMeasurements of area and volume are derived from distances. For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, for example in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.\n\nthumb|An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is similar to them. The last figure is neither. Congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like distance and angles. The latter sort of properties are called invariants and studying them is the essence of geometry.\nEuclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as \"equal\" (\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2) if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal respectively, and similarly for angles. The stronger term \"congruent\" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as similar. Corresponding angles in a pair of similar shapes are congruent and corresponding sides are in proportion to each other.\n\nNotation and terminology\n\nNaming of points and figures\nPoints are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.\n\n Complementary and supplementary angles \nAngles whose sum is a right angle are called complementary. Complementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the right angle. The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\n\nAngles whose sum is a straight angle are supplementary. Supplementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the straight angle (180 degree angle). The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\n\n Modern versions of Euclid's notation \nIn modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in degrees or radians.\n\nModern school textbooks often define separate figures called lines (infinite), rays (semi-infinite), and line segments (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as \"if the line is extended to a sufficient length,\" although he occasionally referred to \"infinite lines\". A \"line\" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term \"straight line\" when necessary.\n\n Some important or well known results \n\nPons Asinorum\nThe Bridge of Asses (Pons Asinorum) states that in isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another.Euclid, book I, proposition 5, tr. Heath, p.\u00a0251 Its name may be attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.Ignoring the alleged difficulty of Book I, Proposition 5, Sir Thomas L. Heath mentions another interpretation. This rests on the resemblance of the figure's lower straight lines to a steeply inclined bridge that could be crossed by an ass but not by a horse: \"But there is another view (as I have learnt lately) which is more complimentary to the ass. It is that, the figure of the proposition being like that of a trestle bridge, with a ramp at each end which is more practicable the flatter the figure is drawn, the bridge is such that, while a horse could not surmount the ramp, an ass could; in other words, the term is meant to refer to the sure-footedness of the ass rather than to any want of intelligence on his part.\" (in \"Excursis II,\" volume 1 of Heath's translation of The Thirteen Books of the Elements.)\n\nCongruence of triangles\nthumb|right|Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles unless the angle specified is a right angle.\n\nTriangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them equal (SAS), or two angles and a side equal (ASA) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). Triangles with three equal angles (AAA) are similar, but not necessarily congruent. Also, triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal or congruent.\n\nTriangle angle sum\nThe sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to a straight angle (180 degrees).Euclid, book I, proposition 32 This causes an equilateral triangle to have three interior angles of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle to have at least two acute angles and up to one obtuse or right angle.\n\nPythagorean theorem\nThe celebrated Pythagorean theorem (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).\n\nThales' theorem\nThales' theorem, named after Thales of Miletus states that if A, B, and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Cantor supposed that Thales proved his theorem by means of Euclid Book I, Prop. 32 after the manner of Euclid Book III, Prop. 31.Heath, p.\u00a0135. Extract of page 135Heath, p.\u00a0318\n\nScaling of area and volume\nIn modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions, , and the volume of a solid to the cube, . Euclid proved these results in various special cases such as the area of a circleEuclid, book XII, proposition 2 and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid.Euclid, book XI, proposition 33 Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor Archimedes who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.Ball, p.\u00a066\n\nApplications\n\nBecause of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it is impractical to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.\n\nAs suggested by the etymology of the word, one of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was surveying,Ball, p.\u00a05 and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally.Eves, vol. 1, p.\u00a05; Mlodinow, p.\u00a07 The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, both of which can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains, such as Gunter's chain, and angles using graduated circles and, later, the theodolite.\n\nAn application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient packing of spheres in n dimensions. This problem has applications in error detection and correction.\n\nGeometric optics uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.\n\nGeometry is used extensively in architecture.\n\nGeometry can be used to design origami. Some classical construction problems of geometry are impossible using compass and straightedge, but can be solved using origami.\n\nQuite a lot of CAD (computer-aided design) and CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) is based on Euclidean geometry. Design geometry typically consists of shapes bounded by planes, cylinders, cones, tori, etc. CAD/CAM is essential in the design of almost everything, nowadays, including cars, airplanes, ships, and the iPhone. A few decades ago, sophisticated draftsmen learned some fairly advanced Euclidean geometry, including things like Pascal's theorem and Brianchon's theorem. But now they don't have to, because the geometric constructions are all done by CAD programs.\n\nAs a description of the structure of space\nEuclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Euclid's proofs depend upon assumptions perhaps not obvious in Euclid's fundamental axioms, in particular that certain movements of figures do not change their geometrical properties such as the lengths of sides and interior angles, the so-called Euclidean motions, which include translations, reflections and rotations of figures.See, for example:  and  The group of motions underlie the metric notions of geometry. See  Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries (in other words, space is homogeneous and unbounded); postulate 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is isotropic and figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and postulate 5 (the parallel postulate) that space is flat (has no intrinsic curvature).\n\nAs discussed in more detail below, Einstein's theory of relativity significantly modifies this view.\n\nThe ambiguous character of the axioms as originally formulated by Euclid makes it possible for different commentators to disagree about some of their other implications for the structure of space, such as whether or not it is infiniteHeath, p.\u00a0200 (see below) and what its topology is. Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the systeme.g., Tarski (1951) typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues. Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1-4 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in elliptic geometry), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a torus for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).\n\nLater work\n\nArchimedes and Apollonius\nthumb|right|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.\nArchimedes (c. 287 BCE \u2013 c. 212 BCE), a colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are recorded, is remembered along with Euclid as one of the greatest of ancient mathematicians. Although the foundations of his work were put in place by Euclid, his work, unlike Euclid's, is believed to have been entirely original.Eves, p.\u00a027 He proved equations for the volumes and areas of various figures in two and three dimensions, and enunciated the Archimedean property of finite numbers.\n\nApollonius of Perga (c. 262 BCE \u2013 c. 190 BCE) is mainly known for his investigation of conic sections.\n\nthumb|left|Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Portrait after Frans Hals, 1648.\n\n17th century: Descartes\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) developed analytic geometry, an alternative method for formalizing geometry which focused on turning geometry into algebra.Ball, pp. 268ff\n\nIn this approach, a point on a plane is represented by its Cartesian (x, y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on.\n\nIn Euclid's original approach, the Pythagorean theorem follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered theorems.\n\nThe equation\n\ndefining the distance between two points P = (px, py) and Q = (qx, qy) is then known as the Euclidean metric, and other metrics define non-Euclidean geometries.\n\nIn terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y = 2x + 1 (a line), or x2 + y2 = 7 (a circle).\n\nAlso in the 17th century, Girard Desargues, motivated by the theory of perspective, introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity. The result can be considered as a type of generalized geometry, projective geometry, but it can also be used to produce proofs in ordinary Euclidean geometry in which the number of special cases is reduced.Eves (1963)\n\nright|thumb|Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized compass and straightedge.\n\n18th century\nGeometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763, at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found incorrect.Hofstadter 1979, p.\u00a091.\n\nLeading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of trisecting an angle with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until Pierre Wantzel published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved impossible include doubling the cube and squaring the circle. In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two,Theorem 120, Elements of Abstract Algebra, Allan Clark, Dover,  while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.\n\nEuler discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called affine geometry, which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).\n\n19th century and non-Euclidean geometry\nIn the early 19th century, Carnot and M\u00f6bius systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.Eves (1963), p.\u00a064\n\nThe century's most significant development in geometry occurred when, around 1830, J\u00e1nos Bolyai and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published work on non-Euclidean geometry, in which the parallel postulate is not valid.Ball, p.\u00a0485 Since non-Euclidean geometry is provably relatively consistent with Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.\n\nIn the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of the theorems stated in the Elements. For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore must be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the Elements, shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third vertex. His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they do not assert the geometrical property of continuity, which in Cartesian terms is equivalent to the completeness property of the real numbers. Starting with Moritz Pasch in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of Hilbert,* Howard Eves, 1997 (1958). Foundations and Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics. Dover. George Birkhoff,Birkhoff, G. D., 1932, \"A Set of Postulates for Plane Geometry (Based on Scale and Protractors),\" Annals of Mathematics 33. and Tarski.Tarski (1951)\n\n20th century and general relativity\nthumb|right|A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar eclipse. The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.\nEinstein's theory of general relativity shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry.Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.\u00a0191 For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of the software that runs the GPS system.Rizos, Chris. University of New South Wales. GPS Satellite Signals. 1999. It is possible to object to this interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.\n\nTreatment of infinity\n\nInfinite objects\nEuclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between \"finite lines\" (e.g., Postulate 2) and \"infinite lines\" (book I, proposition 12). However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite.\n\nThe notion of infinitesimal quantities had previously been discussed extensively by the Eleatic School, but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as Zeno's paradox occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the method of exhaustion rather than infinitesimals.Ball, p.\u00a031\n\nLater ancient commentators, such as Proclus (410\u2013485 CE), treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it.Heath, p.\u00a0268\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Otto Stolz, Paul du Bois-Reymond, Giuseppe Veronese, and others produced controversial work on non-Archimedean models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the Newton\u2013Leibniz sense.Giuseppe Veronese, On Non-Archimedean Geometry, 1908. English translation in Real Numbers, Generalizations of the Reals, and Theories of Continua, ed. Philip Ehrlich, Kluwer, 1994. Fifty years later, Abraham Robinson provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work.Robinson, Abraham (1966). Non-standard analysis.\n\nInfinite processes\nOne reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time.For the assertion that this was the historical reason for the ancients considering the parallel postulate less obvious than the others, see Nagel and Newman 1958, p.\u00a09.\n\nThe modern formulation of proof by induction was not developed until the 17th century, but some later commentators consider it implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes.Cajori (1918), p.\u00a0197\n\nSupposed paradoxes involving infinite series, such as Zeno's paradox, predated Euclid. Euclid avoided such discussions, giving, for example, the expression for the partial sums of the geometric series in IX.35 without commenting on the possibility of letting the number of terms become infinite.\n\nLogical basis\n\nClassical logic\nEuclid frequently used the method of proof by contradiction, and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes classical logic, in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition \"P or not P\" is automatically true.\n\nModern standards of rigor\nPlacing Euclidean geometry on a solid axiomatic basis was a preoccupation of mathematicians for centuries.A detailed discussion can be found in  The role of primitive notions, or undefined concepts, was clearly put forward by Alessandro Padoa of the Peano delegation at the 1900 Paris conference: \n\nThat is, mathematics is context-independent knowledge within a hierarchical framework. As said by Bertrand Russell:\n\nSuch foundational approaches range between foundationalism and formalism.\n\nAxiomatic formulations\n\nEuclid's axioms: In his dissertation to Trinity College, Cambridge, Bertrand Russell summarized the changing role of Euclid's geometry in the minds of philosophers up to that time. It was a conflict between certain knowledge, independent of experiment, and empiricism, requiring experimental input. This issue became clear as it was discovered that the parallel postulate was not necessarily valid and its applicability was an empirical matter, deciding whether the applicable geometry was Euclidean or non-Euclidean.\nHilbert's axioms: Hilbert's axioms had the goal of identifying a simple and complete set of independent axioms from which the most important geometric theorems could be deduced. The outstanding objectives were to make Euclidean geometry rigorous (avoiding hidden assumptions) and to make clear the ramifications of the parallel postulate.\nBirkhoff's axioms: Birkhoff proposed four postulates for Euclidean geometry that can be confirmed experimentally with scale and protractor. This system relies heavily on the properties of the real numbers. The notions of angle and distance become primitive concepts.\nTarski's axioms: Alfred Tarski (1902\u20131983) and his students defined elementary Euclidean geometry as the geometry that can be expressed in first-order logic and does not depend on set theory for its logical basis, in contrast to Hilbert's axioms, which involve point sets. Tarski proved that his axiomatic formulation of elementary Euclidean geometry is consistent and complete in a certain sense: there is an algorithm that, for every proposition, can be shown either true or false. (This doesn't violate G\u00f6del's theorem, because Euclidean geometry cannot describe a sufficient amount of arithmetic for the theorem to apply.Franz\u00e9n, Torkel (2005). G\u00f6del's Theorem: An Incomplete Guide to its Use and Abuse. AK Peters. . Pp. 25\u201326.) This is equivalent to the decidability of real closed fields, of which elementary Euclidean geometry is a model.\n\nConstructive approaches and pedagogy\nThe process of abstract axiomatization as exemplified by Hilbert's axioms reduces geometry to theorem proving or predicate logic. In contrast, the Greeks used construction postulates, and emphasized problem solving. For the Greeks, constructions are more primitive than existence propositions, and can be used to prove existence propositions, but not vice versa. To describe problem solving adequately requires a richer system of logical concepts. The contrast in approach may be summarized:\nAxiomatic proof: Proofs are deductive derivations of propositions from primitive premises that are \u2018true\u2019 in some sense. The aim is to justify the proposition.\nAnalytic proof: Proofs are non-deductive derivations of hypotheses from problems. The aim is to find hypotheses capable of giving a solution to the problem. One can argue that Euclid's axioms were arrived upon in this manner. In particular, it is thought that Euclid felt the parallel postulate was forced upon him, as indicated by his reluctance to make use of it, and his arrival upon it by the method of contradiction.\n\nAndrei Nicholaevich Kolmogorov proposed a problem solving basis for geometry. A description of the approach, which was based upon geometric transformations, can be found in Teaching geometry in the USSR Chernysheva, Firsov, and Teljakovskii This work was a precursor of a modern formulation in terms of constructive type theory.

{"title": "Foundations of geometry", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry", "text": "Foundations of geometry is the study of geometries as axiomatic systems. There are several sets of axioms which give rise to Euclidean geometry or to non-Euclidean geometries. These are fundamental to the study and of historical importance, but there are a great many modern geometries that are not Euclidean which can be studied from this viewpoint. The term axiomatic geometry can be applied to any geometry that is developed from an axiom system, but is often used to mean Euclidean geometry studied from this point of view. The completeness and independence of general axiomatic systems are important mathematical considerations, but there are also issues to do with the teaching of geometry which come into play.\n\nAxiomatic systems\n\nBased on ancient Greek methods, an axiomatic system is a formal description of a way to establish the mathematical truth that flows from a fixed set of assumptions. Although applicable to any area of mathematics, geometry is the branch of elementary mathematics in which this method has most extensively been successfully applied.\n\nThere are several components of an axiomatic system.\n Primitives (undefined terms) are the most basic ideas. Typically they include objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things like points, lines and planes while a fundamental relationship is that of incidence  \u2013 of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. Hilbert once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs. His point being that the primitive terms are just empty shells, place holders if you will, and have no intrinsic properties.\n Axioms (or postulates) are statements about these primitives; for example, any two points are together incident with just one line (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are  the building blocks of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have.\n The laws of logic.\n The theoremsIn this context no distinction is made between different categories of theorems. Propositions, lemmas, corollaries, etc. are all treated the same. are the logical consequences of the axioms, that is, the statements that can be obtained from the axioms by using the laws of deductive logic.\n\nAn interpretation of an axiomatic system is some particular way of giving concrete meaning to the primitives of that system. If this association of meanings makes the axioms of the system true statements, then the interpretation is called a model of the system. In a model, all the theorems of the system are automatically true statements.\n\nProperties of axiomatic systems\nIn discussing axiomatic systems several properties are often focused on:\n The axioms of an axiomatic system are said to be consistent if no logical contradiction can be derived from them. Except in the simplest systems, consistency is a difficult property to establish in an axiomatic system. On the other hand, if a model exists for the axiomatic system, then any contradiction derivable in the system is also derivable in the model, and the axiomatic system is as consistent as any system in which the model belongs. This property (having a model) is referred to as relative consistency or model consistency.\n An axiom is called independent if it can not be proved or disproved from the other axioms of the axiomatic system. An axiomatic system is said to be independent if each of its axioms is independent. If a true statement is a logical consequence of an axiomatic system, then it will be a true statement in every model of that system. To prove that an axiom is independent of the remaining axioms of the system, it is sufficient to find two models of the remaining axioms, for which the axiom is a true statement in one and a false statement in the other. Independence is not always a desirable property from a pedagogical viewpoint.\n An axiomatic system is called complete if every statement expressible in the terms of the system is either provable or has a provable negation. Another way to state this is that no independent statement can be added to a complete axiomatic system which is consistent with axioms of that system. \n An axiomatic system is categorical if any two models of the system are isomorphic (essentially, there is only one model for the system). A categorical system is necessarily complete, but completeness does not imply categoricity. In some situations categoricity is not a desirable property, since categorical axiomatic systems can not be generalized. For instance, the value of the axiomatic system for group theory is that it is not categorical, so proving a result in group theory means that the result is valid in all the different models for group theory and one doesn't have to reprove the result in each of the non-isomorphic models.\n\nEuclidean geometry\n\nEuclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described (although non-rigorously by modern standards) in his textbook on geometry: the Elements. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.\n\nFor over two thousand years, the adjective \"Euclidean\" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the parallel postulate) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other geometries which are not Euclidean are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century.\n\nEuclid's Elements\n\nEuclid's Elements is a mathematical and geometric treatise consisting of 13 books written by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid in Alexandria c. 300 BC. It is a collection of definitions, postulates (axioms), propositions (theorems and constructions), and mathematical proofs of the propositions. The thirteen books cover Euclidean geometry and the ancient Greek version of elementary number theory. With the exception of Autolycus' On the Moving Sphere, the Elements is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises, and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of mathematics. It has proven instrumental in the development of logic and modern science.\n\nEuclid's Elements has been referred to as the most successfulEncyclopedia of Ancient Greece (2006) by Nigel Guy Wilson, page 278. Published by Routledge Taylor and Francis Group. Quote:\"Euclid's Elements subsequently became the basis of all mathematical education, not only in the Romand and Byzantine periods, but right down to the mid-20th century, and it could be argued that it is the most successful textbook ever written.\" and influential textbook ever written. Being first set in type in Venice in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by Carl Benjamin Boyer to be second only to the Bible in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.The Historical Roots of Elementary Mathematics by Lucas Nicolaas Hendrik Bunt, Phillip S. Jones, Jack D. Bedient (1988), page 142. Dover publications. Quote:\"the Elements became known to Western Europe via the Arabs and the Moors. There the Elements became the foundation of mathematical education. More than 1000 editions of the Elements are known. In all probability it is, next to the Bible, the most widely spread book in the civilization of the Western world.\" For centuries, when the quadrivium was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's Elements was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.From the introduction by Amit Hagar to Euclid and His Modern Rivals by Lewis Carroll (2009, Barnes & Noble) pg. xxviii: Geometry emerged as an indispensable part of the standard education of the English gentleman in the eighteenth century; by the Victorian period it was also becoming an important part of the education of artisans, children at Board Schools, colonial subjects and, to a rather lesser degree, women. ... The standard textbook for this purpose was none other than Euclid's The Elements. \n\nThe Elements are mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. It is assumed that its superiority over earlier treatments was recognized, with the consequence that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.\n\nBooks I\u2013IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g., If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal. The Pythagorean theorem is proved.Euclid, book I, proposition 47\n\nBooks V and VII\u2013X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as prime numbers and rational and irrational numbers are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved.\n\nBooks XI\u2013XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.\n\nthumb|The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.\n\nNear the beginning of the first book of the Elements, Euclid gives five postulates (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):\n\n\"Let the following be postulated\":\n \"To draw a straight line from any point to any point.\"\n \"To produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.\"\n \"To describe a circle with any centre and distance [radius].\"\n \"That all right angles are equal to one another.\"\n The parallel postulate: \"That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.\"\n\nAlthough Euclid's statement of the postulates only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructions, they are also assumed to produce unique objects.\n\nThe success of the Elements is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are supposedly his. Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the Elements, encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The Elements still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.\n\nA critique of Euclid\nThe standards of mathematical rigor have changed since Euclid wrote the Elements. Modern attitudes towards, and viewpoints of, an axiomatic system can make it appear that Euclid was in some way sloppy or careless in his approach to the subject, but this is an ahistorical illusion. It is only after the foundations were being carefully examined in response to the introduction of non-Euclidean geometry that what we now consider flaws began to emerge. Mathematician and historian W. W. Rouse Ball put these criticisms in perspective, remarking that \"the fact that for two thousand years [the Elements] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose.\"\n\nSome of the main issues with Euclid's presentation are:\n Lack of recognition of the concept of primitive terms, objects and notions that must be left undefined in the development of an axiomatic system.\n The use of superposition in some proofs without there being an axiomatic justification of this method.\n Lack of a concept of continuity which is needed to prove the existence of some points and lines that Euclid constructs.\n Lack of clarity on whether a straight line is infinite or boundary-less in the second postulate.\n Lack of the concept of betweeness used, among other things, for distinguishing between the inside and outside of various figures.\n\nEuclid's list of axioms in the Elements was not exhaustive, but represented the principles that seemed the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms. He does not go astray and prove erroneous things because of this since he is actually making use of implicit assumptions whose validity appears to be justified by the diagrams which accompany his proofs. Later mathematicians have incorporated Euclid's implicit axiomatic assumptions in the list of formal axioms, thereby greatly extending that list.\n\nFor example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points. Later, in the fourth construction, he used superposition (moving the triangles on top of each other) to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal then they are congruent; during these considerations he uses some properties of superposition, but these properties are not described explicitly in the treatise. If superposition is to be considered a valid method of geometric proof, all of geometry would be full of such proofs. For example, propositions I.1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I.3 can be proved trivially by using superposition.\n\nTo address these issues in Euclid's work, later authors have either attempted to fill in the holes in Euclid's presentation\u2013the most notable of these attempts is due to D. Hilbert\u2013or to organize the axiom system around different concepts, as G.D. Birkhoff has done.\n\nPasch and Peano\nThe German mathematician Moritz Pasch (1843\u20131930) was the first to accomplish the task of putting Euclidean geometry on a firm axiomatic footing. In his book, Vorlesungen \u00fcber neuere Geometrie published in 1882, Pasch laid the foundations of the modern axiomatic method. He originated the concept of primitive notion (which he called Kernbegriffe) and together with the axioms (Kerns\u00e4tzen) he constructs a formal system which is free from any intuitive influences. According to Pasch, the only place where intuition should play a role is in deciding what the primitive notions and axioms should be. Thus, for Pasch, point is a primitive notion but line (straight line) is not, since we have good intuition about points but no one has ever seen or had experience with an infinite line. The primitive notion that Pasch uses in its place is line segment.\n\nPasch observed that the ordering of points on a line (or equivalently containment properties of line segments) is not properly resolved by Euclid's axioms; thus, Pasch's theorem, stating that if two line segment containment relations hold then a third one also holds, cannot be proven from Euclid's axioms. The related Pasch's axiom concerns the intersection properties of lines and triangles.\n\nPasch's work on the foundations set the standard for rigor, not only in geometry but also in the wider context of mathematics. His breakthrough ideas are now so commonplace that it is difficult to remember that they had a single originator. Pasch's work directly influenced many other mathematicians, in particular D. Hilbert and the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858\u20131932). Peano's 1889 work on geometry, largely a translation of Pasch's treatise into the notation of symbolic logic (which Peano invented), uses the primitive notions of point and betweeness. Peano breaks the empirical tie in the choice of primitive notions and axioms that Pasch required. For Peano, the entire system is purely formal, divorced from any empirical input.\n\nPieri and the Italian school of geometers\nThe Italian mathematician Mario Pieri (1860\u20131913) took a different approach and considered a system in which there were only two primitive notions, that of point and of motion. Pasch had used four primitives and Peano had reduced this to three, but both of these approaches relied on some concept of betweeness which Pieri replaced by his formulation of motion. In 1905 Pieri gave the first axiomatic treatment of complex projective geometry which did not start by building real projective geometry.\n\nPieri was a member of a group of Italian geometers and logicians that Peano had gathered around himself in Turin. This group of assistants, junior colleagues and others were dedicated to carrying out Peano's logico\u2013geometrical program of putting the foundations of geometry on firm axiomatic footing based on Peano's logical symbolism. Besides Pieri, Burali-Forti, Padoa and Fano were in this group. In 1900 there were two international conferences held back-to-back in Paris, the International Congress of Philosophy and the Second International Congress of Mathematicians. This group of Italian mathematicians was very much in evidence at these congresses, pushing their axiomatic agenda.Pieri did not attend since he had recently moved to Sicily, but he did have a paper of his read at the Congress of Philosophy. Padoa gave a well regarded talk and Peano, in the question period after David Hilbert's famous address on unsolved problems, remarked that his colleagues had already solved Hilbert's second problem.\n\nHilbert's axioms\n\nthumb|David Hilbert\nAt the University of G\u00f6ttingen, during the 1898\u20131899 winter term, the eminent German mathematician David Hilbert (1862\u20131943) presented a course of lectures on the foundations of geometry. At the request of Felix Klein, Professor Hilbert was asked to write up the lecture notes for this course in time for the summer 1899 dedication ceremony of a monument to C.F. Gauss and Wilhelm Weber to be held at the university. The rearranged lectures were published in June 1899 under the title Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundations of Geometry). The influence of the book was immediate. According to :\nBy developing a postulate set for Euclidean geometry that does not depart too greatly in spirit from Euclid's own, and by employing a minimum of symbolism, Hilbert succeeded in convincing mathematicians to a far greater extent than had Pasch and Peano, of the purely hypothetico-deductive nature of geometry. But the influence of Hilbert's work went far beyond this, for, backed by the author's great mathematical authority, it firmly implanted the postulational method, not only in the field of geometry, but also in essentially every other branch of mathematics. The stimulus to the development of the foundations of mathematics provided by Hilbert's little book is difficult to overestimate. Lacking the strange symbolism of the works of Pasch and Peano, Hilbert's work can be read, in great part, by any intelligent student of high school geometry.\nIt is difficult to specify the axioms used by Hilbert without referring to the publication history of the Grundlagen since Hilbert changed and modified them several times. The original monograph was quickly followed by a French translation, in which Hilbert added V.2, the Completeness Axiom. An English translation, authorized by Hilbert, was made by E.J. Townsend and copyrighted in 1902. This translation incorporated the changes made in the French translation and so is considered to be a translation of the 2nd edition. Hilbert continued to make changes in the text and several editions appeared in German. The 7th edition was the last to appear in Hilbert's lifetime. New editions followed the 7th, but the main text was essentially not revised. The modifications in these editions occur in the appendices and in supplements. The changes in the text were large when compared to the original and a new English translation was commissioned by Open Court Publishers, who had published the Townsend translation. So, the 2nd English Edition was translated by Leo Unger from the 10th German edition in 1971. This translation incorporates several revisions and enlargements of the later German editions by Paul Bernays. The differences between the two English translations are due not only to Hilbert, but also to differing choices made by the two translators. What follows will be based on the Unger translation.\n\nHilbert's axiom system is constructed with six primitive notions: point, line, plane, betweenness,  lies on (containment), and congruence.\n\nAll points, lines, and planes in the following axioms are distinct unless otherwise stated.\n\nI. Incidence\n\n For every two points A and B there exists a line a that contains them both. We write AB = a or BA = a. Instead of \u201ccontains,\u201d we may also employ other forms of expression; for example, we may say \u201cA lies upon a\u201d, \u201cA is a point of a\u201d, \u201ca goes through A and through B\u201d, \u201ca joins A to B\u201d, etc. If A lies upon a and at the same time upon another line b, we make use also of the expression: \u201cThe lines a and b have the point A in common,\u201d etc.\n For every two points there exists no more than one line that contains them both; consequently, if AB = a and AC = a, where B \u2260 C, then also BC = a.\n There exist at least two points on a line. There exist at least three points that do not lie on a line.\n For every three points A, B, C not situated on the same line there exists a plane \u03b1 that contains all of them. For every plane there exists a point which lies on it. We write ABC = \u03b1. We employ also the expressions: \u201cA, B, C, lie in \u03b1\u201d; \u201cA, B, C are points of \u03b1\u201d, etc.\n For every three points A, B, C which do not lie in the same line, there exists no more than one plane that contains them all.\n If two points A, B of a line a lie in a plane \u03b1, then every point of a lies in \u03b1. In this case we say: \u201cThe line a lies in the plane \u03b1,\u201d etc.\n If two planes \u03b1, \u03b2 have a point A in common, then they have at least a second point B in common.\n There exist at least four points not lying in a plane.\n\nII. Order\n\n If a point B lies between points A and C, B is also between C and A, and there exists a line containing the distinct points A,B,C.\n If A and C are two points of a line, then there exists at least one point B lying between A and C. \n Of any three points situated on a line, there is no more than one which lies between the other two.\n Pasch's Axiom: Let A, B, C be three points not lying in the same line and let a be a line lying in the plane ABC and not passing through any of the points A, B, C. Then, if the line a passes through a point of the segment AB, it will also pass through either a point of the segment BC or a point of the segment AC.\n\nIII. Congruence\n\n If A, B are two points on a line a, and if A\u2032 is a point upon the same or another line a\u2032 , then, upon a given side of A\u2032 on the straight line a\u2032 , we can always find a point B\u2032 so that the segment AB is congruent to the segment A\u2032B\u2032 . We indicate this relation by writing AB \u2245 A\u2032 B\u2032. Every segment is congruent to itself; that is, we always have AB \u2245 AB.We can state the above axiom briefly by saying that every segment can be laid off upon a given side of a given point of a given straight line in at least one way.\n If a segment AB is congruent to the segment A\u2032B\u2032 and also to the segment A\u2033B\u2033, then the segment A\u2032B\u2032 is congruent to the segment A\u2033B\u2033; that is, if AB \u2245 A\u2032B\u2032 and AB \u2245 A\u2033B\u2033, then A\u2032B\u2032 \u2245 A\u2033B\u2033.\n Let AB and BC be two segments of a line a which have no points in common aside from the point B, and, furthermore, let A\u2032B\u2032 and B\u2032C\u2032 be two segments of the same or of another line a\u2032 having, likewise, no point other than B\u2032 in common. Then, if AB \u2245 A\u2032B\u2032 and BC \u2245 B\u2032C\u2032, we have AC \u2245 A\u2032C\u2032.\n Let an angle \u2220\u00a0(h,k) be given in the plane \u03b1 and let a line a\u2032 be given in a plane \u03b1\u2032. Suppose also that, in the plane \u03b1\u2032, a definite side of the straight line a\u2032 be assigned. Denote by h\u2032 a ray of the straight line a\u2032 emanating from a point O\u2032 of this line. Then in the plane \u03b1\u2032 there is one and only one ray k\u2032 such that the angle \u2220\u00a0(h, k), or \u2220\u00a0(k, h), is congruent to the angle \u2220\u00a0(h\u2032, k\u2032) and at the same time all interior points of the angle \u2220\u00a0(h\u2032, k\u2032) lie upon the given side of a\u2032. We express this relation by means of the notation \u2220\u00a0(h, k) \u2245 \u2220\u00a0(h\u2032, k\u2032).\n If the angle \u2220\u00a0(h, k) is congruent to the angle \u2220\u00a0(h\u2032, k\u2032) and to the angle \u2220\u00a0(h\u2033, k\u2033), then the angle \u2220\u00a0(h\u2032, k\u2032) is congruent to the angle \u2220\u00a0(h\u2033, k\u2033); that is to say, if \u2220\u00a0(h, k) \u2245 \u2220\u00a0(h\u2032, k\u2032) and \u2220\u00a0(h, k) \u2245 \u2220\u00a0(h\u2033, k\u2033), then \u2220\u00a0(h\u2032, k\u2032) \u2245 \u2220\u00a0(h\u2033, k\u2033).\n\nIV. Parallels\n\n (Euclid's Axiom):This is Hilbert's terminology. This statement is more familiarly known as Playfair's axiom. Let a be any line and A a point not on it. Then there is at most one line in the plane, determined by a and A, that passes through A and does not intersect a.\n\nV. Continuity\n\n Axiom of Archimedes. If AB and CD are any segments then there exists a number n such that n segments CD constructed contiguously from A, along the ray from A through B, will pass beyond the point B.\n Axiom of line completeness. An extension of a set of points on a line with its order and congruence relations that would preserve the relations existing among the original elements as well as the fundamental properties of line order and congruence that follows from Axioms I\u2013III and from V-1 is impossible.\n\nChanges in Hilbert's axioms\nWhen the monograph of 1899 was translated into French, Hilbert added:\n V.2 Axiom of completeness. To a system of points, straight lines, and planes, it is impossible to add other elements in such a manner that the system thus generalized shall form a new geometry obeying all of the five groups of axioms. In other words, the elements of geometry form a system which is not susceptible of extension, if we regard the five groups of axioms as valid.\n\nThis axiom is not needed for the development of Euclidean geometry, but is needed to establish a bijection between the real numbers and the points on a line. This was an essential ingredient in Hilbert's proof of the consistency of his axiom system.\n\nBy the 7th edition of the Grundlagen, this axiom had been replaced by the axiom of line completeness given above and the old axiom V.2 became Theorem 32.\n\nAlso to be found in the 1899 monograph (and appearing in the Townsend translation) is:\nII.4. Any four points A, B, C, D of a line can always be labeled so that B shall lie between A and C and also between A and D, and, furthermore, that C shall lie between A and D and also between B and D.\n\nHowever, E.H. Moore and R.L. Moore independently proved that this axiom is redundant, and the former published this result in an article appearing in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1902. Hilbert moved the axiom to Theorem 5 and renumbered the axioms accordingly (old axiom II-5 (Pasch's axiom) now became II-4).\n\nWhile not as dramatic as these changes, most of the remaining axioms were also modified in form and/or function over the course of the first seven editions.\n\nConsistency and Independence\nGoing beyond the establishment of a satisfactory set of axioms, Hilbert also proved the consistency of his system relative to the theory of real numbers by constructing a model of his axiom system from the real numbers. He proved the independence of some of his axioms by constructing models of geometries which satisfy all except the one axiom under consideration. Thus, there are examples of geometries satisfying all except the Archimedean axiom V.1 (non-Archimedean geometries), all except the parallel axiom IV.1 (non-Euclidean geometries) and so on. Using the same technique he also showed how some important theorems depended on certain axioms and were independent of others. Some of his models were very complex and other mathematicians tried to simplify them. For instance, Hilbert's model for showing the independence of Desargues theorem from certain axioms ultimately led Ray Moulton to discover the non-Desarguesian Moulton plane. These investigations by Hilbert virtually inaugurated the modern study of abstract geometry in the twentieth century.\n\nBirkhoff's axioms\n\nthumb|George David Birkhoff\nIn 1932, G. D. Birkhoff created a set of four postulates of Euclidean geometry sometimes referred to as Birkhoff's axioms. These postulates are all based on basic geometry that can be experimentally verified with a scale and protractor. In a radical departure from the synthetic approach of Hilbert, Birkhoff was the first to build the foundations of geometry on the real number system. It is this powerful assumption that permits the small number of axioms in this system.\n\nPostulates\n\nBirkhoff uses four undefined terms: point, line, distance and angle. His postulates are:\n \nPostulate I: Postulate of Line Measure.  \nThe points A, B, ... of any line can be put into 1:1 correspondence with the real numbers x so that |xB\u00a0\u2212x\u00a0A| =\u00a0d(A,\u00a0B) for all points A and\u00a0B.\n\nPostulate II: Point-Line Postulate.  \nThere is one and only one straight line, \u2113, that contains any two given distinct points P and\u00a0Q.\n\nPostulate III: Postulate of Angle Measure.  \nThe rays {\u2113,\u00a0m,\u00a0n,\u00a0...} through any point O can be put into 1:1 correspondence with the real numbers a\u00a0(mod\u00a02\u03c0) so that if A and B are points (not equal to O) of \u2113 and m, respectively, the difference am\u00a0\u2212\u00a0a\u2113\u00a0(mod\u00a02\u03c0) of the numbers associated with the lines \u2113 and m is AOB. Furthermore, if the point B on m varies continuously in a line r not containing the vertex O, the number am varies continuously also.\n\nPostulate IV: Postulate of Similarity.  \nIf in two triangles ABC and A'B'C'\u00a0 and for some constant k\u00a0>\u00a00, d(A',\u00a0B' ) =\u00a0kd(A, B), d(A',\u00a0C'\u00a0)\u00a0=\u00a0kd(A,\u00a0C) and B'A'C'\u00a0\u00a0=\u00a0\u00b1BAC, then d(B',\u00a0C'\u00a0)\u00a0=\u00a0kd(B,\u00a0C), \u00a0C'B'A'\u00a0\u00a0=\u00a0\u00b1CBA, and A'C'B'\u00a0\u00a0=\u00a0\u00b1ACB.\n\nSchool geometry\nright|thumb|George Bruce Halsted\n\nWhether or not it is wise to teach Euclidean geometry from an axiomatic viewpoint at the high school level has been a matter of debate. There have been many attempts to do so and not all of them have been successful. In 1904, George Bruce Halsted published a high school geometry text based on Hilbert's axiom set. Logical criticisms of this text led to a highly revised second edition. In reaction to the launching of the Russian satellite Sputnik there was a call to revise the school mathematics curriculum. From this effort there arose the New Math program of the 1960s. With this as a background, many individuals and groups set about to provide textual material for geometry classes based on an axiomatic approach.\n\nMac Lane's axioms\nleft|thumb|Saunders Mac Lane\n\nSaunders Mac Lane (1909\u20132005), a mathematician,among his several achievements, he is the cofounder (with Samuel Eilenberg) of Category theory. wrote a paper in 1959 in which he proposed a set of axioms for Euclidean geometry in the spirit of Birkhoff's treatment using a distance function to associate real numbers with line segments. This was not the first attempt to base a school level treatment on Birkhoff's system, in fact, Birkhoff and Ralph Beatley had written a high school text in 1940 [Reprint of 3rd edition: American Mathematical Society, 2000. ] which developed Euclidean geometry from five axioms and the ability to measure line segments and angles. However, in order to gear the treatment to a high school audience, some mathematical and logical arguments were either ignored or slurred over.\n\nIn Mac Lane's system there are four primitive notions (undefined terms): point, distance, line and angle measure. There are also 14 axioms, four giving the properties of the distance function, four describing properties of lines, four discussing angles (which are directed angles in this treatment), a similarity axiom (essentially the same as Birkhoff's) and a continuity axiom which can be used to derive the Crossbar theorem and its converse. The increased number of axioms has the pedagogical advantage of making early proofs in the development easier to follow and the use of a familiar metric permits a rapid advancement through basic material so that the more \"interesting\" aspects of the subject can be gotten to sooner.\n\nSMSG (School Mathematics Study Group) axioms\n\nIn the 1960s a new set of axioms for Euclidean geometry, suitable for high school geometry courses, was introduced by the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG), as a part of the New math curricula. This set of axioms follows the Birkhoff model of using the real numbers to gain quick entry into the geometric fundamentals. However, whereas Birkhoff tried to minimize the number of axioms used, and most authors were concerned with the independence of the axioms in their treatments, the SMSG axiom list was intentionally made large and redundant for pedagogical reasons. The SMSG only produced a mimeographed text using these axioms, but Edwin E. Moise, a member of the SMSG, wrote a high school text based on this system, and a college level text, , with some of the redundancy removed and modifications made to the axioms for a more sophisticated audience.\n\nThere are eight undefined terms: point, line, plane, lie on, distance, angle measure, area and volume. The 22 axioms of this system are given individual names for ease of reference. Amongst these are to be found: the Ruler Postulate, the Ruler Placement Postulate, the Plane Separation Postulate, the Angle Addition Postulate, the Side angle side (SAS) Postulate, the Parallel Postulate (in Playfair's form), and Cavalieri's principle.\n\nUCSMP (University of Chicago School Mathematics Project) axioms\nAlthough much of the New math curriculum has been drastically modified or abandoned, the geometry portion has remained relatively stable. Modern high school textbooks use axiom systems that are very similar to those of the SMSG. For example, the texts produced by the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project (UCSMP) use a system which, besides some updating of language, differs mainly from the SMSG system in that it includes some transformation concepts under its \"Reflection Postulate\".\n\nThere are only three undefined terms: point, line and plane. There are eight \"postulates\", but most of these have several parts (which are generally called assumptions in this system). Counting these parts, there are 32 axioms in this system. Amongst the postulates can be found the point-line-plane postulate, the Triangle inequality postulate, postulates for distance, angle measurement, corresponding angles, area and volume, and the Reflection postulate. The reflection postulate is used as a replacement for the SAS postulate of SMSG system.\n\nOther systems\nOswald Veblen (1880 \u2013 1960) provided a new axiom system in 1904 when he replaced the concept of \"betweeness\", as used by Hilbert and Pasch, with a new primitive, order. This permitted several primitive terms used by Hilbert to become defined entities, reducing the number of primitive notions to two, point and order.\n\nMany other axiomatic systems for Euclidean geometry have been proposed over the years. A comparison of many of these can be found in a 1927 monograph by Henry George Forder. (reprinted by Dover, 1958) Forder also gives, by combining axioms from different systems, his own treatment based on the two primitive notions of point and order. He also provides a more abstract treatment of one of Pieri's systems (from 1909) based on the primitives point and congruence.\n\nStarting with Peano, there has been a parallel thread of interest amongst logicians concerning the axiomatic foundations of Euclidean geometry. This can be seen, in part, in the notation used to describe the axioms. Pieri claimed that even though he wrote in the traditional language of geometry, he was always thinking in terms of the logical notation introduced by Peano, and used that formalism to see how to prove things. A typical example of this type of notation can be found in the work of E. V. Huntington (1874 \u2013 1952) who, in 1913, produced an axiomatic treatment of three-dimensional Euclidean geometry based upon the primitive notions of sphere and inclusion (one sphere lying within another). Beyond notation there is also interest in the logical structure of the theory of geometry. Alfred Tarski proved that a portion of geometry, which he called elementary geometry, is a first order logical theory (see Tarski's axioms).\n\nModern text treatments of the axiomatic foundations of Euclidean geometry follow the pattern of H.G. Forder and Gilbert de B. Robinson who mix and match axioms from different systems to produce different emphasizes.  is a modern example of this approach.\n\nNon-Euclidean geometry\n\nIn view of the role which mathematics plays in science and implications of scientific knowledge for all of our beliefs, revolutionary changes in man's understanding of the nature of mathematics could not but mean revolutionary changes in his understanding of science, doctrines of philosophy, religious and ethical beliefs, and, in fact, all intellectual disciplines.\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century a revolution took place in the field of geometry that was as scientifically important as the Copernican revolution in astronomy and as philosophically profound as the Darwinian theory of evolution in its impact on the way we think. This was the consequence of the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry. For over two thousand years, starting in the time of Euclid, the postulates which grounded geometry were considered self-evident truths about physical space. Geometers thought that they were deducing other, more obscure truths from them, without the possibility of error. This view became untenable with the development of hyperbolic geometry. There were now two incompatible systems of geometry (and more came later) that were self-consistent and compatible with the observable physical world. \"From this point on, the whole discussion of the relation between geometry and physical space was carried on in quite different terms.\"\n\nTo obtain a non-Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate (or its equivalent) must be replaced by its negation. Negating the Playfair's axiom form, since it is a compound statement (... there exists one and only one ...), can be done in two ways. Either there will exist more than one line through the point parallel to the given line or there will exist no lines through the point parallel to the given line. In the first case, replacing the parallel postulate (or its equivalent) with the statement \"In a plane, given a point P and a line \u2113 not passing through P, there exist two lines through P which do not meet \u2113\" and keeping all the other axioms, yields hyperbolic geometry.while only two lines are postulated, it is easily shown that there must be an infinite number of such lines. The second case is not dealt with as easily. Simply replacing the parallel postulate with the statement, \"In a plane, given a point P and a line \u2113 not passing through P, all the lines through P meet \u2113\", does not give a consistent set of axioms. This follows since parallel lines exist in absolute geometry,Book I Proposition 27 of Euclid's Elements but this statement would say that there are no parallel lines. This problem was known (in a different guise) to Khayyam, Saccheri and Lambert and was the basis for their rejecting what was known as the \"obtuse angle case\". In order to obtain a consistent set of axioms which includes this axiom about having no parallel lines, some of the other axioms must be tweaked. The adjustments to be made depend upon the axiom system being used. Amongst others these tweaks will have the effect of modifying Euclid's second postulate from the statement that line segments can be extended indefinitely to the statement that lines are unbounded. Riemann's elliptic geometry emerges as the most natural geometry satisfying this axiom.\n\nIt was Gauss who coined the term \"non-Euclidean geometry\".Felix Klein, Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint: Geometry, Dover, 1948 (reprint of English translation of 3rd Edition, 1940. First edition in German, 1908) pg. 176 He was referring to his own, unpublished work, which today we call hyperbolic geometry. Several authors still consider \"non-Euclidean geometry\" and \"hyperbolic geometry\" to be synonyms. In 1871, Felix Klein, by adapting a metric discussed by Arthur Cayley in 1852, was able to bring metric properties into a projective setting and was thus able to unify the treatments of hyperbolic, euclidean and elliptic geometry under the umbrella of projective geometry.F. Klein, \u00dcber die sogenannte nichteuklidische Geometrie, Mathematische Annalen, 4(1871). Klein is responsible for the terms \"hyperbolic\" and \"elliptic\" (in his system he called Euclidean geometry \"parabolic\", a term which has not survived the test of time and is used today only in a few disciplines.) His influence has led to the common usage of the term \"non-Euclidean geometry\" to mean either \"hyperbolic\" or \"elliptic\" geometry.\n\nThere are some mathematicians who would extend the list of geometries that should be called \"non-Euclidean\" in various ways. In other disciplines, most notably mathematical physics, where Klein's influence was not as strong, the term \"non-Euclidean\" is often taken to mean not Euclidean.\n\nEuclid's parallel postulate\n\nFor two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. A possible reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that, unlike the first four postulates, the parallel postulate isn't self-evident. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. Many attempts were made to prove the fifth postulate from the other four, many of them being accepted as proofs for long periods of time until the mistake was found. Invariably the mistake was assuming some 'obvious' property which turned out to be equivalent to the fifth postulate. Eventually it was realized that this postulate may not be provable from the other four. According to  this opinion about the parallel postulate (Postulate 5) does appear in print:\nApparently the first to do so was G. S. Kl\u00fcgel (1739\u20131812), a doctoral student at the University of Gottingen, with the support of his teacher A. G. K\u00e4stner, in the former's 1763 dissertation Conatuum praecipuorum theoriam parallelarum demonstrandi recensio (Review of the Most Celebrated Attempts at Demonstrating the Theory of Parallels). In this work Kl\u00fcgel examined 28 attempts to prove Postulate 5 (including Saccheri's), found them all deficient, and offered the opinion that Postulate 5 is unprovable and is supported solely by the judgment of our senses.\n\nThe beginning of the 19th century would finally witness decisive steps in the creation of non-Euclidean geometry. Circa 1813, Carl Friedrich Gauss and independently around 1818, the German professor of law Ferdinand Karl SchweikartIn a letter of December 1818, Ferdinand Karl Schweikart (1780\u20131859) sketched a few insights into non-Euclidean geometry.  The letter was forwarded to Gauss in 1819 by Gauss's former student Gerling.  In his reply to Gerling, Gauss praised Schweikart and mentioned his own, earlier research into non-Euclidean geometry. had the germinal ideas of non-Euclidean geometry worked out, but neither published any results. Then, around 1830, the Hungarian mathematician J\u00e1nos Bolyai and the Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published treatises on what we today call hyperbolic geometry.  Consequently, hyperbolic geometry has been  called Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry, as both mathematicians, independent of each other, are the basic authors of non-Euclidean geometry. Gauss mentioned to Bolyai's father, when shown the younger Bolyai's work, that he had developed such a geometry several years before,In the letter to Wolfgang (Farkas) Bolyai of March 6, 1832 Gauss claims to have worked on the problem for thirty or thirty-five years . In his 1824 letter to Taurinus  he claimed that he had been working on the problem for over 30 years and provided enough detail to show that he actually had worked out the details. According to  it wasn't until around 1813 that Gauss had come to accept the existence of a new geometry. though he did not publish. While Lobachevsky created a non-Euclidean geometry by negating the parallel postulate, Bolyai worked out a geometry where both the Euclidean and the hyperbolic geometry are possible depending on a parameter k. Bolyai ends his work by mentioning that it is not possible to decide through mathematical reasoning alone if the geometry of the physical universe is Euclidean or non-Euclidean; this is a task for the physical sciences. \nThe independence of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by Eugenio Beltrami in 1868.Beltrami, Eugenio Teoria fondamentale degli spaz\u00ee di curvatura costante, Annali. di Mat., ser II 2 (1868), 232\u2013255\n\nThe various attempted proofs of the parallel postulate produced a long list of theorems that are equivalent to the parallel postulate. Equivalence here means that in the presence of the other axioms of the geometry each of these theorems can be assumed to be true and the parallel postulate can be proved from this altered set of axioms. This is not the same as logical equivalence.An appropriate example of logical equivalence is given by Playfair's axiom and Euclid I.30 (see Playfair's axiom#Transitivity of parallelism). In different sets of axioms for Euclidean geometry, any of these can replace the Euclidean parallel postulate.For instance, Hilbert uses Playfair's axiom while Birkhoff uses the theorem about similar but not congruent triangles. The following partial list indicates some of these theorems that are of historical interest.attributions are due to \n Parallel straight lines are equidistant. (Poseidonios, 1st century B.C.)\n All the points equidistant from a given straight line, on a given side of it, constitute a straight line. (Christoph Clavius, 1574)\n Playfair's axiom. In a plane, there is at most one line that can be drawn parallel to another given one through an external point. (Proclus, 5th century, but popularized by John Playfair, late 18th century)\n The sum of the angles in every triangle is 180\u00b0 (Gerolamo Saccheri, 1733; Adrien-Marie Legendre, early 19th century)\n There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180\u00b0. (Gerolamo Saccheri, 1733; Adrien-Marie Legendre, early 19th century)\n There exists a pair of similar, but not congruent, triangles. (Gerolamo Saccheri, 1733)\n Every triangle can be circumscribed. (Adrien-Marie Legendre, Farkas Bolyai, early 19th century)\n If three angles of a quadrilateral are right angles, then the fourth angle is also a right angle. (Alexis-Claude Clairaut, 1741; Johann Heinrich Lambert, 1766)\n There exists a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles. (Geralamo Saccheri, 1733)\n Wallis' postulate. On a given finite straight line it is always possible to construct a triangle similar to a given triangle. (John Wallis, 1663; Lazare-Nicholas-Marguerite Carnot, 1803; Adrien-Marie Legendre, 1824)\n There is no upper limit to the area of a triangle. (Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1799)\n The summit angles of the Saccheri quadrilateral are 90\u00b0. (Geralamo Saccheri, 1733)\n Proclus' axiom. If a line intersects one of two parallel lines, both of which are coplanar with the original line, then it also intersects the other. (Proclus, 5th century)\n\nNeutral (or Absolute) geometry\n\nAbsolute geometry is a geometry based on an axiom system consisting of all the axioms giving Euclidean geometry except for the parallel postulate or any of its alternatives.Use a complete set of axioms for Euclidean geometry such as Hilbert's axioms or another modern equivalent . Euclid's original set of axioms is ambiguous and not complete, it does not form a basis for Euclidean geometry. The term was introduced by J\u00e1nos Bolyai in 1832.In \"Appendix exhibiting the absolute science of space: independent of the truth or falsity of Euclid's Axiom XI (by no means previously decided)\"  It is sometimes referred to as neutral geometry,Greenberg cites W. Prenowitz and M. Jordan (Greenberg, p. xvi) for having used the term neutral geometry to refer to that part of Euclidean geometry that does not depend on Euclid's parallel postulate.  He says that the word absolute in absolute geometry misleadingly implies that all other geometries depend on it. as it is neutral with respect to the parallel postulate.\n\nRelation to other geometries\nIn Euclid's Elements, the first 28 propositions and Proposition I.31 avoid using the parallel postulate, and therefore are valid theorems in absolute geometry.  Proposition I.31 proves the existence of parallel lines (by construction). Also,  the Saccheri\u2013Legendre theorem, which states that the sum of the angles in a triangle is at most 180\u00b0, can be proved.\n\nThe theorems of absolute geometry hold in hyperbolic geometry as well as in Euclidean geometry.Absolute geometry is, in fact, the intersection of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry when these are regarded as sets of propositions.\n\nAbsolute geometry is inconsistent with elliptic geometry: in elliptic geometry there are no parallel lines at all, but in absolute geometry parallel lines do exist. Also, in elliptic geometry, the sum of the angles in any triangle is greater than 180\u00b0.\n\nIncompleteness\nLogically, the axioms do not form a complete theory since one can add extra independent axioms without making the axiom system inconsistent.  One can extend absolute geometry by adding different axioms about parallelism and get incompatible but consistent axiom systems, giving rise to Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry.  Thus every theorem of absolute geometry is a theorem of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry.  However the converse is not true. Also, absolute geometry is not a categorical theory, since it has models that are not isomorphic.\n\nHyperbolic geometry\n\nIn the axiomatic approach to hyperbolic geometry (also referred to as Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyai\u2013Lobachevskian geometry), one additional axiom is added to the axioms giving absolute geometry. The new axiom is Lobachevsky's parallel postulate (also known as the characteristic postulate of hyperbolic geometry):\nThrough a point not on a given line there exists (in the plane determined by this point and line) at least two lines which do not meet the given line.\nWith this addition, the axiom system is now complete.\n\nAlthough the new axiom asserts only the existence of two lines, it is readily established that there are an infinite number of lines through the given point which do not meet the given line. Given this plenitude, one must be careful with terminology in this setting, as the term parallel line no longer has the unique meaning that it has in Euclidean geometry. Specifically, let P be a point not on a given line . Let PA be the perpendicular drawn from P to  (meeting at point A). The lines through P fall into two classes, those that meet  and those that don't. The characteristic postulate of hyperbolic geometry says that there are at least two lines of the latter type. Of the lines which don't meet , there will be (on each side of PA) a line making the smallest angle with PA. Sometimes these lines are referred to as the first lines through P which don't meet  and are variously called limiting, asymptotic or parallel lines (when this last term is used, these are the only parallel lines). All other lines through P which do not meet  are called non-intersecting or ultraparallel lines.\n\nSince hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry are both built on the axioms of absolute geometry, they share many properties and propositions. However, the consequences of replacing the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry with the characteristic postulate of hyperbolic geometry can be dramatic. To mention a few of these:\n\nupright|thumb|Lambert quadrilateral in hyperbolic geometry\n A Lambert quadrilateral is a quadrilateral which has three right angles. The fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral is acute if the geometry is hyperbolic, and a right angle if the geometry is Euclidean. Furthermore, rectangles can exist (a statement equivalent to the parallel postulate) only in Euclidean geometry.\n A Saccheri quadrilateral is a quadrilateral which has two sides of equal length, both perpendicular to a side called the base. The other two angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are called the summit angles and they have equal measure. The summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are acute if the geometry is hyperbolic, and right angles if the geometry is Euclidean.\n The sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle is less than 180\u00b0 if the geometry is hyperbolic, and equal to 180\u00b0 if the geometry is Euclidean. The defect of a triangle is the numerical value (180\u00b0 \u2013 sum of the measures of the angles of the triangle). This result may also be stated as: the defect of triangles in hyperbolic geometry is positive, and the defect of triangles in Euclidean geometry is zero.\n The area of a triangle in hyperbolic geometry is bounded while triangles exist with arbitrarily large areas in Euclidean geometry.\n The set of points on the same side and equally far from a given straight line themselves form a line in Euclidean geometry, but don't in hyperbolic geometry (they form a hypercycle.)\n\nAdvocates of the position that Euclidean geometry is the one and only \"true\" geometry received a setback when, in a memoir published in 1868, \"Fundamental theory of spaces of constant curvature\", Eugenio Beltrami gave an abstract proof of equiconsistency of hyperbolic and Euclidean geometry for any dimension. He accomplished this by introducing several models of non-Euclidean geometry that are now known as the Beltrami\u2013Klein model, the Poincar\u00e9 disk model, and the Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model, together with transformations that relate them. For the half-plane model, Beltrami cited a note by Liouville in the treatise of Monge on differential geometry. Beltrami also showed that n-dimensional Euclidean geometry is realized on a horosphere of the (n\u00a0+\u00a01)-dimensional hyperbolic space, so the logical relation between consistency of the Euclidean and the non-Euclidean geometries is symmetric.\n\nElliptic geometry\n\nAnother way to modify the Euclidean parallel postulate is to assume that there are no parallel lines in a plane. Unlike the situation with hyperbolic geometry, where we just add one new axiom, we can not obtain a consistent system by adding this statement as a new axiom to the axioms of absolute geometry. This follows since parallel lines provably exist in absolute geometry. Other axioms must be changed.\n\nStarting with Hilbert's axioms the necessary changes involve removing Hilbert's four axioms of order and replacing them with these seven axioms of separation concerned with a new undefined relation.\n\nThere is an undefined (primitive) relation between four points, A, B, C and D denoted by (A,C|B,D) and read as \"A and C separate B and D\",Visualize four points on a circle which in counter-clockwise order are A, B, C and D. satisfying these axioms:\n If (A,B|C,D), then the points A, B, C and D are collinear and distinct.\n If (A,B|C,D), then (C,D|A,B) and (B,A|D,C).\n If (A,B|C,D), then not (A,C|B,D).\n If points A, B, C and D are collinear and distinct then (A,B|C,D) or (A,C|B,D) or (A,D|B,C).\n If points A, B, and C are collinear and distinct, then there exists a point D such that (A,B|C,D).\n For any five distinct collinear points A, B, C, D and E, if (A,B|D,E), then either  (A,B|C,D) or (A,B|C,E).\n Perspectivities preserve separation.\n\nSince the Hilbert notion of \"betweeness\" has been removed, terms which were defined using that concept need to be redefined.This reenforces the futility of attempting to \"fix\" Euclid's axioms to obtain this geometry. Changes need to be made in the unstated assumptions of Euclid. Thus, a line segment AB defined as the points A and B and all the points between A and B in absolute geometry, needs to be reformulated. A line segment in this new geometry is determined by three collinear points A, B and C and consists of those three points and all the points not separated from B by A and C. There are further consequences. Since two points do not determine a line segment uniquely, three noncollinear points do not determine a unique triangle, and the definition of triangle has to be reformulated.\n\nOnce these notions have been redefined, the other axioms of absolute geometry (incidence, congruence and continuity) all make sense and are left alone. Together with the new axiom on the nonexistence of parallel lines we have a consistent system of axioms giving a new geometry. The geometry that results is called (plane) Elliptic geometry''.\n\n150px|thumb|Saccheri quadrilaterals in Euclidean, Elliptic and Hyperbolic geometry\n\nEven though elliptic geometry is not an extension of absolute geometry (as Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry are), there is a certain \"symmetry\" in the propositions of the three geometries that reflects a deeper connection which was observed by Felix Klein. Some of the propositions which exhibit this property are:\n\n The fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral is an obtuse angle in elliptic geometry.\n The summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are obtuse in elliptic geometry.\n The sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle is greater than 180\u00b0 if the geometry is elliptic. That is, the defect of a triangle is negative.Negative defect is called the excess, so this may also be phrased as\u2013 triangles have a positive excess in elliptic geometry.\n All the lines perpendicular to a given line meet at a common point in elliptic geometry, called the pole of the line. In hyperbolic geometry these lines are mutually non-intersecting, while in Euclidean geometry they are mutually parallel.\n\nOther results, such as the exterior angle theorem, clearly emphasize the difference between elliptic and the geometries that are extensions of absolute geometry.\n\nSpherical geometry\n\nOther geometries\n\nProjective geometry\n\nAffine geometry\n\nOrdered geometry\n\nAbsolute geometry is an extension of ordered geometry, and thus, all theorems in ordered geometry hold in absolute geometry. The converse is not true. Absolute geometry assumes the first four of Euclid's Axioms (or their equivalents), to be contrasted with affine geometry, which does not assume Euclid's third and fourth axioms. Ordered geometry is a common foundation of both absolute and affine geometry.Coxeter, pgs.\u00a0175\u2013176\n\nFinite geometry\n\nSee also\n Coordinate-free\n Synthetic geometry\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n \n\n (3 vols.):  (vol. 1),  (vol. 2),  (vol. 3). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n\n Collection of articles on life and mathematics of Peano (1960s to 1980s).\n\nSMSG axioms\n\nCategory:Foundations of geometry\nCategory:Foundations of mathematics\nCategory:History of mathematics"}

Britannica and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics.Leon Horsten (2007, rev. 2012), \"Philosophy of Mathematics\" SEP In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague.\nFoundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (set, function, geometrical figure, number, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.\n\nThe foundations of mathematics as a whole does not aim to contain the foundations of every mathematical topic.\nGenerally, the foundations of a field of study refers to a more-or-less systematic analysis of its most basic or fundamental concepts, its conceptual unity and its natural ordering or hierarchy of concepts, which may help to connect it with the rest of human knowledge. The development, emergence and clarification of the foundations can come late in the history of a field, and may not be viewed by everyone as its most interesting part.\n\nMathematics always played a special role in scientific thought, serving since ancient times as a model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry, and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences (especially physics). Mathematics' many developments towards higher abstractions in the 19th century brought new challenges and paradoxes, urging for a deeper and more systematic examination of the nature and criteria of mathematical truth, as well as a unification of the diverse branches of mathematics into a coherent whole.\n\nThe systematic search for the foundations of mathematics started at the end of the 19th century and formed a new mathematical discipline called mathematical logic, with strong links to theoretical computer science.\nIt went through a series of crises with paradoxical results, until the discoveries stabilized during the 20th century as a large and coherent body of mathematical knowledge with several aspects or components (set theory, model theory, proof theory, etc.), whose detailed properties and possible variants are still an active research field.\nIts high level of technical sophistication inspired many philosophers to conjecture that it can serve as a model or pattern for the foundations of other sciences.\n\n Historical context \n\n Ancient Greek mathematics \n\nWhile the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations, special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the Ancient Greeks.\n\nEarly Greek philosophers disputed as to which is more basic, arithmetic or geometry.\nZeno of Elea (490 c. 430\u00a0BC) produced four paradoxes that seem to show the impossibility of change. The Pythagorean school of mathematics originally insisted that only natural and rational numbers exist. The discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side (around 5th century\u00a0BC), was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted. The discrepancy between rationals and reals was finally resolved by Eudoxus of Cnidus (408\u2013355\u00a0BC), a student of Plato, who reduced the comparison of irrational ratios to comparisons of multiples (rational ratios), thus anticipating the definition of real numbers by Richard Dedekind (1831\u20131916).\n\nIn the Posterior Analytics, Aristotle (384\u2013322\u00a0BC) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts, axioms, postulates, definitions, and theorems. Aristotle took a majority of his examples for this from arithmetic and from geometry.\nThis method reached its high point with Euclid's Elements (300\u00a0BC), a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor: Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms (though they do not always conform strictly to Aristotelian templates).\nAristotle's syllogistic logic, together with the axiomatic method exemplified by Euclid's Elements, are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient Greece.\n\n Platonism as a traditional philosophy of mathematics \n\nStarting from the end of the 19th century, a Platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians.\n\nThe concepts or, as Platonists would have it, the objects of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience: geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects, and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects. Their existence and nature present special philosophical challenges: How do mathematical objects differ from their concrete representation? Are they located in their representation, or in our minds, or somewhere else? How can we know them?\n\nThe ancient Greek philosophers took such questions very seriously. Indeed, many of their general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. Plato (424/423\u00a0BC 348/347\u00a0BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic Ideas (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is discovered by humans. In the Meno Plato's teacher Socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval.\n\nAbove the gateway to Plato's academy appeared a famous inscription: \"Let no one who is ignorant of geometry enter here\". In this way Plato indicated his high opinion of geometry. He regarded geometry as \"the first essential in the training of philosophers\", because of its abstract character.\n\nThis philosophy of Platonist mathematical realism is shared by many mathematicians. It can be argued that Platonism somehow comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work.Karlis Podnieks, Platonism, intuition and the nature of mathematics: 1. Platonism - the Philosophy of Working Mathematicians\n\nIn this view, the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status, and the effectiveness ceases to be unreasonable. Not our axioms, but the very real world of mathematical objects forms the foundation.\n\nAristotle dissected and rejected this view in his Metaphysics. These questions provide much fuel for philosophical analysis and debate.\n\n Middle Ages and Renaissance \nFor over 2,000 years, Euclid's Elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics, as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists well into the 19th century.\n\nThe Middle Ages saw a dispute over the ontological status of the universals (platonic Ideas): Realism asserted their existence independently of perception; conceptualism asserted their existence within the mind only; nominalism denied either, only seeing universals as names of collections of individual objects (following older speculations that they are words, \"logoi\").\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes published La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1637), aimed at reducing geometry to algebra by means of coordinate systems, giving algebra a more foundational role (while the Greeks embedded arithmetic into geometry by identifying whole numbers with evenly spaced points on a line). Descartes' book became famous after 1649 and paved the way to infinitesimal calculus.\n\nIsaac Newton (1642\u20131727) in England and Leibniz (1646\u20131716) in Germany independently developed the infinitesimal calculus based on heuristic methods greatly efficient, but direly lacking rigorous justifications. Leibniz even went on to explicitly describe infinitesimals as actual infinitely small numbers (close to zero). Leibniz also worked on formal logic but most of his writings on it remained unpublished until 1903.\n\nThe Protestant philosopher George Berkeley (1685\u20131753), in his campaign against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics, wrote a pamphlet on the lack of rational justifications of infinitesimal calculus:The Analyst, A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician \"They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?\"\n\nThen mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications, but with little attention to logical foundations.\n\n 19th century \nIn the 19th century, mathematics became increasingly abstract. Concerns about logical gaps and inconsistencies in different fields led to the development of axiomatic systems.\n\n Real analysis \n\nCauchy (1789\u20131857) started the project of formulating and proving the theorems of infinitesimal calculus in a rigorous manner, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra exploited by earlier authors. In his 1821 work Cours d'Analyse he defines infinitely small quantities in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0, which he then used to define continuity. But he did not formalize his notion of convergence.\n\nThe modern (\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit and continuous functions was first developed by Bolzano in 1817, but remained relatively unknown. It gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers, arguably resolving the Zeno paradoxes and Berkeley's arguments.\n\nMathematicians such as Karl Weierstrass (1815\u20131897) discovered pathological functions such as continuous, nowhere-differentiable functions. Previous conceptions of a function as a rule for computation, or a smooth graph, were no longer adequate. Weierstrass began to advocate the arithmetization of analysis, to axiomatize analysis using properties of the natural numbers.\n\nIn 1858, Dedekind proposed a definition of the real numbers as cuts of rational numbers. This reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers, and thus of natural numbers, was later integrated by Cantor in his set theory, and axiomatized in terms of second order arithmetic by Hilbert and Bernays.\n\n Group theory \n\nFor the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. Niels Henrik Abel (1802\u20131829), a Norwegian, and \u00c9variste Galois, (1811\u20131832) a Frenchman, investigated the solutions of various polynomial equations, and proved that there is no general algebraic solution to equations of degree greater than four (Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem). With these concepts, Pierre Wantzel (1837) proved that straightedge and compass alone cannot trisect an arbitrary angle nor double a cube. In 1882, Lindemann building on the work of Hermite showed that a straightedge and compass quadrature of the circle (construction of a square equal in area to a given circle) was also impossible by proving that  is a transcendental number. Mathematicians had attempted to solve all of these problems in vain since the time of the ancient Greeks.\n\nAbel and Galois's works opened the way for the developments of group theory (which would later be used to study symmetry in physics and other fields), and abstract algebra. Concepts of vector spaces emerged from the conception of barycentric coordinates by M\u00f6bius in 1827, to the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps by Peano in 1888. Geometry was no more limited to three dimensions.\nThese concepts did not generalize numbers but combined notions of functions and sets which were not yet formalized, breaking away from familiar mathematical objects.\n\n Non-Euclidean geometries \n\nAfter many failed attempts to derive the parallel postulate from other axioms, the study of the still hypothetical hyperbolic geometry by Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728\u20131777) led him to introduce the hyperbolic functions and compute the area of a hyperbolic triangle (where the sum of angles is less than 180\u00b0). Then the Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792\u20131856) established in 1826 (and published in 1829) the coherence of this geometry (thus the independence of the parallel postulate), in parallel with the Hungarian mathematician J\u00e1nos Bolyai (1802\u20131860) in 1832, and with Gauss.\nLater in the 19th century, the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann developed Elliptic geometry, another non-Euclidean geometry where no parallel can be found and the sum of angles in a triangle is more than 180\u00b0. It was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great circle on the sphere. At that time, the main method for proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a model for it.\n\n Projective geometry \nOne of the traps in a deductive system is circular reasoning, a problem that seemed to befall projective geometry until it was resolved by Karl von Staudt. As explained by Russian historians:Laptev, B.L. & B.A. Rozenfel'd (1996) Mathematics of the 19th Century: Geometry, page 40, Birkh\u00e4user \n\nThe purely geometric approach of von Staudt was based on the complete quadrilateral to express the relation of projective harmonic conjugates. Then he created a means of expressing the familiar numeric properties with his Algebra of Throws. English language versions of this process of deducing the properties of a field can be found in either the book by Oswald Veblen and John Young, Projective Geometry (1938), or more recently in John Stillwell's Four Pillars of Geometry (2005). Stillwell writes on page 120\n\nThe algebra of throws is commonly seen as a feature of cross-ratios since students ordinarily rely upon numbers without worry about their basis. However, cross-ratio calculations use metric features of geometry, features not admitted by purists. For instance, in 1961 Coxeter wrote Introduction to Geometry without mention of cross-ratio.\n\n Boolean algebra and logic \nAttempts of formal treatment of mathematics had started with Leibniz and Lambert (1728\u20131777), and continued with works by algebraists such as George Peacock (1791\u20131858).\nSystematic mathematical treatments of logic came with the British mathematician George Boole (1847) who devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called Boolean algebra, in which the only numbers were 0 and 1 and logical combinations (conjunction, disjunction, implication and negation) are operations similar to the addition and multiplication of integers. Additionally, De Morgan published his laws in 1847. Logic thus became a branch of mathematics. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in computer science.\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce built upon the work of Boole to develop a logical system for relations and quantifiers, which he published in several papers from 1870 to 1885.\n\nThe German mathematician Gottlob Frege (1848\u20131925) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his Begriffsschrift (formula language) published in 1879, a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic. He exposed deficiencies in Aristotle's Logic, and pointed out the three expected properties of a mathematical theory:\n\n Consistency: impossibility of proving contradictory statements.\n Completeness: any statement is either provable or refutable (i.e. its negation is provable).\n Decidability: there is a decision procedure to test any statement in the theory.\n\nHe then showed in Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic) how arithmetic could be formalised in his new logic.\n\nFrege's work was popularized by Bertrand Russell near the turn of the century. But Frege's two-dimensional notation had no success. Popular notations were (x) for universal and (\u2203x) for existential quantifiers, coming from Giuseppe Peano and William Ernest Johnson until the \u2200 symbol was introduced by Gerhard Gentzen in 1935 and became canonical in the 1960s.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1905, Ernst Schr\u00f6der published Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik in three volumes. This work summarized and extended the work of Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce, and was a comprehensive reference to symbolic logic as it was understood at the end of the 19th century.\n\n Peano arithmetic \n\nThe formalization of arithmetic (the theory of natural numbers) as an axiomatic theory started with Peirce in 1881 and continued with Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano in 1888. This was still a second-order axiomatization (expressing induction in terms of arbitrary subsets, thus with an implicit use of set theory) as concerns for expressing theories in first-order logic were not yet understood. In Dedekind's work, this approach appears as completely characterizing natural numbers and providing recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the successor function and mathematical induction.\n\n Foundational crisis \nThe foundational crisis of mathematics (in German Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik) was the early 20th century's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics.\n\nSeveral schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century, as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes (such as Russell's paradox).\n\nThe name \"paradox\" should not be confused with contradiction. A contradiction in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory (such as ), showing that this theory is inconsistent and must be rejected. But a paradox may be either a surprising but true result in a given formal theory, or an informal argument leading to a contradiction, so that a candidate theory, if it is to be formalized, must disallow at least one of its steps; in this case the problem is to find a satisfying theory without contradiction. Both meanings may apply if the formalized version of the argument forms the proof of a surprising truth. For instance, Russell's paradox may be expressed as \"there is no set of all sets\" (except in some marginal axiomatic set theories).\n\nVarious schools of thought opposed each other. The leading school was that of the formalist approach, of which David Hilbert was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as Hilbert's program, which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by metamathematical finitistic means. The main opponent was the intuitionist school, led by L. E. J. Brouwer, which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols (van Dalen, 2008). The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of Mathematische Annalen, the leading mathematical journal of the time.\n\n Philosophical views \n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, three schools of philosophy of mathematics opposed each other: Formalism, Intuitionism and Logicism. The Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences  held in K\u00f6nigsberg in 1930 gave space to these three schools.\n Formalism \n\nIt has been claimed that formalists, such as David Hilbert (1862\u20131943), hold that mathematics is only a language and a series of games. Indeed, he used the words \"formula game\" in his 1927 response to L. E. J. Brouwer's criticisms:\n\nThus Hilbert is insisting that mathematics is not an arbitrary game with arbitrary rules; rather it must agree with how our thinking, and then our speaking and writing, proceeds.\n\nThe foundational philosophy of formalism, as exemplified by David Hilbert, is a response to the paradoxes of set theory, and is based on formal logic. Virtually all mathematical theorems today can be formulated as theorems of set theory. The truth of a mathematical statement, in this view, is represented by the fact that the statement can be derived from the axioms of set theory using the rules of formal logic.\n\nMerely the use of formalism alone does not explain several issues: why we should use the axioms we do and not some others, why we should employ the logical rules we do and not some others, why do \"true\" mathematical statements (e.g., the laws of arithmetic) appear to be true, and so on. Hermann Weyl would ask these very questions of Hilbert:\n\nIn some cases these questions may be sufficiently answered through the study of formal theories, in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory. As noted by Weyl, formal logical systems also run the risk of inconsistency; in Peano arithmetic, this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency, but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently finitary to be meaningful. G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system S was consistent, based on principles P that only made up a small part of S. But G\u00f6del proved that the principles P could not even prove P to be consistent, let alone S.\n\n Intuitionism \n\nIntuitionists, such as L. E. J. Brouwer (1882\u20131966), hold that mathematics is a creation of the human mind. Numbers, like fairy tale characters, are merely mental entities, which would not exist if there were never any human minds to think about them.\n\nThe foundational philosophy of intuitionism or constructivism, as exemplified in the extreme by Brouwer and Stephen Kleene, requires proofs to be \"constructive\" in nature the existence of an object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence. For example, as a consequence of this the form of proof known as reductio ad absurdum is suspect.\n\nSome modern theories in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense.  Some theories tend to focus on mathematical practice, and aim to describe and analyze the actual working of mathematicians as a social group. Others try to create a cognitive science of mathematics, focusing on human cognition as the origin of the reliability of mathematics when applied to the real world. These theories would propose to find foundations only in human thought, not in any objective outside construct. The matter remains controversial.\n\n Logicism \n\nLogicism is a school of thought, and research programme, in the philosophy of mathematics, based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical' in nature . Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead championed this theory initiated by Gottlob Frege and influenced by Richard Dedekind\n\n Set-theoretic Platonism \n\nMany researchers in axiomatic set theory have subscribed to what is known as set-theoretic Platonism, exemplified by Kurt G\u00f6del.\n\nSeveral set theorists followed this approach and actively searched for axioms that may be considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the continuum hypothesis. Many large cardinal axioms were studied, but the hypothesis always remained independent from them and it is now considered unlikely that CH can be resolved by a new large cardinal axiom. Other types of axioms were considered, but none of them has reached consensus on the continuum hypothesis yet. Recent work by Hamkins proposes a more flexible alternative: a set-theoretic multiverse allowing free passage between set-theoretic universes that satisfy the continuum hypothesis and other universes that do not.\n\n Indispensability argument for realism \nThis argument by Willard Quine and Hilary Putnam says (in Putnam's shorter words),\n\nHowever Putnam was not a Platonist.\n\n Rough-and-ready realism \nFew mathematicians are typically concerned on a daily, working basis over logicism, formalism or any other philosophical position. Instead, their primary concern is that the mathematical enterprise as a whole always remains productive. Typically, they see this as ensured by remaining open-minded, practical and busy; as potentially threatened by becoming overly-ideological, fanatically reductionistic or lazy. \n\nSuch a view has also been expressed by some well-known physicists.\n\nFor example, the Physics Nobel Prize laureate Richard Feynman said\n\nAnd Steven Weinberg:<ref name=\"weinberg\">Steven Weinberg, chapter Against Philosophy wrote, in Dreams of a final theory</ref>\n\nWeinberg believed that any undecidability in mathematics, such as the continuum hypothesis, could be potentially resolved despite the incompleteness theorem, by finding suitable further axioms to add to set theory.\n\n Philosophical consequences of G\u00f6del's completeness theorem \n\nG\u00f6del's completeness theorem establishes an equivalence in first-order logic between the formal provability of a formula and its truth in all possible models. Precisely, for any consistent first-order theory it gives an \"explicit construction\" of a model described by the theory; this model will be countable if the language of the theory is countable. However this \"explicit construction\" is not algorithmic. It is based on an iterative process of completion of the theory, where each step of the iteration consists in adding a formula to the axioms if it keeps the theory consistent; but this consistency question is only semi-decidable (an algorithm is available to find any contradiction but if there is none this consistency fact can remain unprovable).\n\nThis can be seen as a giving a sort of justification to the Platonist view that the objects of our mathematical theories are real. More precisely, it shows that the mere assumption of the existence of the set of natural numbers as a totality (an actual infinity) suffices to imply the existence of a model (a world of objects) of any consistent theory. However several difficulties remain:\n\n For any consistent theory this usually does not give just one world of objects, but an infinity of possible worlds that the theory might equally describe, with a possible diversity of truths between them.\n In the case of set theory, none of the models obtained by this construction resemble the intended model, as they are countable while set theory intends to describe uncountable infinities. Similar remarks can be made in many other cases. For example, with theories that include arithmetic, such constructions generally give models that include non-standard numbers, unless the construction method was specifically designed to avoid them.\n As it gives models to all consistent theories without distinction, it gives no reason to accept or reject any axiom as long as the theory remains consistent, but regards all consistent axiomatic theories as referring to equally existing worlds. It gives no indication on which axiomatic system should be preferred as a foundation of mathematics.\n As claims of consistency are usually unprovable, they remain a matter of belief or non-rigorous kinds of justifications. Hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions: the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory.\n\nAnother consequence of the completeness theorem is that it justifies the conception of infinitesimals as actual infinitely small nonzero quantities, based on the existence of non-standard models as equally legitimate to standard ones. This idea was formalized by Abraham Robinson into the theory of nonstandard analysis.\n\n More paradoxes \n\n1920: Thoralf Skolem corrected Leopold L\u00f6wenheim's proof of what is now called the downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, leading to Skolem's paradox discussed in 1922, namely the existence of countable models of ZF, making infinite cardinalities a relative property.\n1922: Proof by Abraham Fraenkel that the axiom of choice cannot be proved from the axioms of Zermelo set theory with urelements.\n1931: Publication of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, showing that essential aspects of Hilbert's program could not be attained. It showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent recursively axiomatizable system such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetic on the (infinite) set of natural numbers a statement that formally expresses its own unprovability, which he then proved equivalent to the claim of consistency of the theory; so that (assuming the consistency as true), the system is not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be completely determined and reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in Hilbert's program. This dealt a final blow to the heart of Hilbert's program, the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means (it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the \"finitistic\" ones, but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to, it was a 'weaker' system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove).\n1936: Alfred Tarski proved his truth undefinability theorem.\n1936: Alan Turing proved that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist.\n1938: G\u00f6del proved the consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis.\n1936\u20131937: Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, respectively, published independent papers showing that a general solution to the Entscheidungsproblem is impossible: the universal validity of statements in first-order logic is not decidable (it is only semi-decidable as given by the completeness theorem).\n1955: Pyotr Novikov showed that there exists a finitely presented group G such that the word problem for G is undecidable.\n1963: Paul Cohen showed that the Continuum Hypothesis is unprovable from ZFC. Cohen's proof developed the method of forcing, which is now an important tool for establishing independence results in set theory.\n1964: Inspired by the fundamental randomness in physics, Gregory Chaitin starts publishing results on algorithmic information theory (measuring incompleteness and randomness in mathematics).\n1966: Paul Cohen showed that the axiom of choice is unprovable in ZF even without urelements.\n1970: Hilbert's tenth problem is proven unsolvable: there is no recursive solution to decide whether a Diophantine equation (multivariable polynomial equation) has a solution in integers.\n1971: Suslin's problem is proven to be independent from ZFC.\n\n Partial resolution of the crisis \nStarting in 1935, the Bourbaki group of French mathematicians started publishing a series of books to formalize many areas of mathematics on the new foundation of set theory.\n\nThe intuitionistic school did not attract many adherents, and it was not until Bishop's work in 1967 that constructive mathematics was placed on a sounder footing.\n\nOne may consider that Hilbert's program has been partially completed, so that the crisis is essentially resolved, satisfying ourselves with lower requirements than Hilbert's original ambitions. His ambitions were expressed in a time when nothing was clear: it was not clear whether mathematics could have a rigorous foundation at all.\n\nThere are many possible variants of set theory, which differ in consistency strength, where stronger versions (postulating higher types of infinities) contain formal proofs of the consistency of weaker versions, but none contains a formal proof of its own consistency. Thus the only thing we don't have is a formal proof of consistency of whatever version of set theory we may prefer, such as ZF.\n\nIn practice, most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of ZFC, generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would run the risk of forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully.\n\nThe development of category theory in the middle of the 20th century showed the usefulness of set theories guaranteeing the existence of larger classes than does ZFC, such as Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory or Tarski\u2013Grothendieck set theory, albeit that in very many cases the use of large cardinal axioms or Grothendieck universes is formally eliminable.\n\nOne goal of the reverse mathematics program is to identify whether there are areas of 'core mathematics' in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis.\n\n See also \n\n Mathematical logic\n Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy\n Church\u2013Turing thesis\n Controversy over Cantor's theory\n Epistemology\n Euclid's Elements Hilbert's problems\n Implementation of mathematics in set theory\n Liar paradox\n New Foundations\n Philosophy of mathematics\n Principia Mathematica Quasi-empiricism in mathematics\n Mathematical thought of Charles Peirce\n\n Notes \n\n References \n Avigad, Jeremy (2003) Number theory and elementary arithmetic, Philosophia Mathematica Vol. 11, pp.\u00a0257\u2013284\n Eves, Howard (1990), Foundations and Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics Third Edition, Dover Publications, INC, Mineola NY,  (pbk.) cf \u00a79.5 Philosophies of Mathematics pp.\u00a0266\u2013271.

{"title": "Fractal", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal", "text": "In mathematics, a fractal is a subset of a Euclidean space for which the Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension. Fractals tend to appear nearly the same at different levels, as is illustrated here in the successively small magnifications of the Mandelbrot set; Because of this, fractals are encountered ubiquitously in nature. Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales called self similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; If this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge, it is called affine self-similar.  Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of topology.\n\nOne way that fractals are different from finite geometric figures is the way in which they scale. Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). However, if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's topological dimension.\n\nAnalytically, fractals are usually nowhere differentiable. An infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line \u2013 although it is still 1-dimensional, its fractal dimension indicates that it also resembles a surface.\n200px|thumb|Sierpinski carpet (to level 6), a fractal with a topological dimension of 1 and a Hausdorff dimension of 1.893\n\nStarting in the 17th century with notions of recursion, fractals have moved through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment of the concept to the study of continuous but not differentiable functions in the 19th century by the seminal work of Bernard Bolzano, Bernhard Riemann, and Karl Weierstrass, and on to the coining of the word fractal in the 20th century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 20th century. The term \"fractal\" was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975. Mandelbrot based it on the Latin , meaning \"broken\" or \"fractured\", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional dimensions to geometric patterns in nature.\n\nThere is some disagreement among mathematicians about how the concept of a fractal should be formally defined. Mandelbrot himself summarized it as \"beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful. That's fractals.\" More formally, in 1982 Mandelbrot stated that \"A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff\u2013Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension.\"Mandelbrot, B. B.: The Fractal Geometry of Nature. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1982); p. 15. Later, seeing this as too restrictive, he simplified and expanded the definition to: \"A fractal is a shape made of parts similar to the whole in some way.\" Still later, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language: \"...to use fractal without a pedantic definition, to use fractal dimension as a generic term applicable to all the variants\".\n\nThe consensus is that theoretical fractals are infinitely self-similar, iterated, and detailed mathematical constructs having fractal dimensions, of which many examples have been formulated and studied in great depth. Fractals are not limited to geometric patterns, but can also describe processes in time. Fractal patterns with various degrees of self-similarity have been rendered or studied in images, structures and sounds and found in nature, technology, art, architectureOstwald, Michael J., and Vaughan, Josephine (2016) The Fractal Dimension of Architecture. Birhauser, Basel. . and law. Fractals are of particular relevance in the field of chaos theory, since the graphs of most chaotic processes are fractals.\n\n Introduction \nthumb|right| A simple fractal tree created through javascript\nThe word \"fractal\" often has different connotations for the lay public as opposed to mathematicians, where the public are more likely to be familiar with fractal art than the mathematical concept. The mathematical concept is difficult to define formally, even for mathematicians, but key features can be understood with little mathematical background.\n\nThe feature of \"self-similarity\", for instance, is easily understood by analogy to zooming in with a lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over. Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally such as in the infinite regress in parallel mirrors or the homunculus, the little man inside the head of the little man inside the head ...). The difference for fractals is that the pattern reproduced must be detailed.\n\nThis idea of being detailed relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractal dimension greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric shapes are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be one-dimensional; if such a curve is rep-tiled into pieces each 1/3 the length of the original, there are always three equal pieces. A solid square is understood to be two-dimensional; if such a figure is rep-tiled pieces each scaled down by a factor of 1/3 in both dimensions, there are a total of 3\u00b2 = 9 pieces. We see that for ordinary self-similar objects, being n-dimensional means that when it is rep-tiled into pieces each scaled down by a scale-factor of 1/r, there are a total of rn pieces. Now, consider the Koch curve. It can be rep-tiled into four sub-copies, each scaled down by a scale-factor of 1/3. So, strictly by analogy, we can consider the \"dimension\" of the Koch curve as being the unique real number D that satisfies 3D = 4, which by no means is an integer! This number is what mathematicians call the fractal dimension of the Koch curve. The fact that the Koch curve has a non-integer fractal dimension is what makes it a fractal.\n\nThis also leads to understanding a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are \"nowhere differentiable\". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot be measured in traditional ways. To elaborate, in trying to find the length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of measuring with a tape measure. But in measuring an infinitely \"wiggly\" fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the jagged pattern would always re-appear, at arbitrarily small scales, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve. The result is that one must need infinite tape to perfectly cover the entire curve, i.e. the snowflake has infinite perimeter.\n\nHistory\nthumb|upright|A Koch snowflake is a fractal that begins with an equilateral triangle and then replaces the middle third of every line segment with a pair of line segments that form an equilateral bump\nThe history of fractals traces a path from chiefly theoretical studies to modern applications in computer graphics, with several notable people contributing canonical fractal forms along the way. According to Pickover, the mathematics behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when the mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz pondered recursive self-similarity (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the straight line was self-similar in this sense). In his writings, Leibniz used the term \"fractional exponents\", but lamented that \"Geometry\" did not yet know of them. Indeed, according to various historical accounts, after that point few mathematicians tackled the issues, and the work of those who did remained obscured largely because of resistance to such unfamiliar emerging concepts, which were sometimes referred to as mathematical \"monsters\". Thus, it was not until two centuries had passed that on July 18, 1872 Karl Weierstrass presented the first definition of a function with a graph that would today be considered a fractal, having the non-intuitive property of being everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable at the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences. In addition, the quotient difference becomes arbitrarily large as the summation index increases. Not long after that, in 1883, Georg Cantor, who attended lectures by Weierstrass, published examples of subsets of the real line known as Cantor sets, which had unusual properties and are now recognized as fractals. Also in the last part of that century, Felix Klein and Henri Poincar\u00e9 introduced a category of fractal that has come to be called \"self-inverse\" fractals.\n\nthumb|upright|A Julia set, a fractal related to the Mandelbrot set\nthumb|A Sierpinski gasket can be generated by a fractal tree.\nOne of the next milestones came in 1904, when Helge von Koch, extending ideas of Poincar\u00e9 and dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition including hand-drawn images of a similar function, which is now called the Koch snowflake. Another milestone came a decade later in 1915, when Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski constructed his famous triangle then, one year later, his carpet. By 1918, two French mathematicians, Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia, though working independently, arrived essentially simultaneously at results describing what are now seen as fractal behaviour associated with mapping complex numbers and iterative functions and leading to further ideas about attractors and repellors (i.e., points that attract or repel other points), which have become very important in the study of fractals. Very shortly after that work was submitted, by March 1918, Felix Hausdorff expanded the definition of \"dimension\", significantly for the evolution of the definition of fractals, to allow for sets to have non-integer dimensions. The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by Paul L\u00e9vy, who, in his 1938 paper Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole described a new fractal curve, the L\u00e9vy C curve.\n\nthumb|upright|A strange attractor that exhibits multifractal scaling\nthumb|upright|Uniform mass center triangle fractal\nthumb|2x 120 degrees recursive IFS\n\nDifferent researchers have postulated that without the aid of modern computer graphics, early investigators were limited to what they could depict in manual drawings, so lacked the means to visualize the beauty and appreciate some of the implications of many of the patterns they had discovered (the Julia set, for instance, could only be visualized through a few iterations as very simple drawings). That changed, however, in the 1960s, when Benoit Mandelbrot started writing about self-similarity in papers such as How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension, which built on earlier work by Lewis Fry Richardson. In 1975 Mandelbrot solidified hundreds of years of thought and mathematical development in coining the word \"fractal\" and illustrated his mathematical definition with striking computer-constructed visualizations. These images, such as of his canonical Mandelbrot set, captured the popular imagination; many of them were based on recursion, leading to the popular meaning of the term \"fractal\".\n\nIn 1980, Loren Carpenter gave a presentation at the SIGGRAPH where he introduced his software for generating and rendering fractally generated landscapes.kottke.org. 2009. Vol Libre, an amazing CG film from 1980. [online] Available at: http://kottke.org/09/07/vol-libre-an-amazing-cg-film-from-1980\n\n Definition and characteristics \nOne often cited description that Mandelbrot published to describe geometric fractals is \"a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole\"; this is generally helpful but limited. Authors disagree on the exact definition of fractal, but most usually elaborate on the basic ideas of self-similarity and the unusual relationship fractals have with the space they are embedded in. \n\nOne point agreed on is that fractal patterns are characterized by fractal dimensions, but whereas these numbers quantify complexity (i.e., changing detail with changing scale), they neither uniquely describe nor specify details of how to construct particular fractal patterns. In 1975 when Mandelbrot coined the word \"fractal\", he did so to denote an object whose Hausdorff\u2013Besicovitch dimension is greater than its topological dimension. However, it has been noted that this requirement is not met by space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve.\n\nBecause of the trouble involved in finding one definition for fractals, some argue that fractals should not be strictly defined at all. According to Falconer, fractals should, in addition to being nowhere differentiable and able to have a fractal dimension, be only generally characterized by a gestalt of the following features;\n\n Self-similarity, which may include:\n Exact self-similarity: identical at all scales, such as the Koch snowflake\n Quasi self-similarity: approximates the same pattern at different scales; may contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms; e.g., the Mandelbrot set's satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies.\n Statistical self-similarity: repeats a pattern stochastically so numerical or statistical measures are preserved across scales; e.g., randomly generated fractals like the well-known example of the coastline of Britain for which one would not expect to find a segment scaled and repeated as neatly as the repeated unit that defines fractals like the Koch snowflake.\n Qualitative self-similarity: as in a time series\n Multifractal scaling: characterized by more than one fractal dimension or scaling rule\n Fine or detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. A consequence of this structure is fractals may have emergent properties (related to the next criterion in this list).\n Irregularity locally and globally that is not easily described in traditional Euclidean geometric language. For images of fractal patterns, this has been expressed by phrases such as \"smoothly piling up surfaces\" and \"swirls upon swirls\".\n Simple and \"perhaps recursive\" definitions; see Common techniques for generating fractals\n\nAs a group, these criteria form guidelines for excluding certain cases, such as those that may be self-similar without having other typically fractal features. A straight line, for instance, is self-similar but not fractal because it lacks detail, is easily described in Euclidean language, has the same Hausdorff dimension as topological dimension, and is fully defined without a need for recursion.\n\n Common techniques for generating fractals \n\nthumb|upright|Self-similar branching pattern modeled in silico using L-systems principles\n\nImages of fractals can be created by fractal generating programs. Because of the butterfly effect, a small change in a single variable can have an unpredictable outcome.\n\n Iterated function systems (IFS) \u2013 use fixed geometric replacement rules; may be stochastic or deterministic; e.g., Koch snowflake, Cantor set, Haferman carpet, Sierpinski carpet, Sierpinski gasket, Peano curve, Harter-Heighway dragon curve, T-square, Menger sponge\n Strange attractors \u2013 use iterations of a map or solutions of a system of initial-value differential or difference equations that exhibit chaos (e.g., see multifractal image, or the logistic map)\n L-systems \u2013 use string rewriting; may resemble branching patterns, such as in plants, biological cells (e.g., neurons and immune system cells), blood vessels, pulmonary structure, etc. or turtle graphics patterns such as space-filling curves and tilings\n Escape-time fractals \u2013 use a formula or recurrence relation at each point in a space (such as the complex plane); usually quasi-self-similar; also known as \"orbit\" fractals; e.g., the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, Burning Ship fractal, Nova fractal and Lyapunov fractal. The 2d vector fields that are generated by one or two iterations of escape-time formulae also give rise to a fractal form when points (or pixel data) are passed through this field repeatedly.\n Random fractals \u2013 use stochastic rules; e.g., L\u00e9vy flight, percolation clusters, self avoiding walks, fractal landscapes, trajectories of Brownian motion and the Brownian tree (i.e., dendritic fractals generated by modeling diffusion-limited aggregation or reaction-limited aggregation clusters).\n\nthumb|upright|A fractal generated by a finite subdivision rule for an alternating link\nFinite subdivision rules \u2013 use a recursive topological algorithm for refining tilingsJ. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. Finite subdivision rules. Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 5 (2001), pp. 153\u2013196. and they are similar to the process of cell division.J. W. Cannon, W. Floyd and W. Parry. Crystal growth, biological cell growth and geometry. Pattern Formation in Biology, Vision and Dynamics, pp. 65\u201382. World Scientific, 2000. , . The iterative processes used in creating the Cantor set and the Sierpinski carpet are examples of finite subdivision rules, as is barycentric subdivision.\n\n Simulated fractals \nFractal patterns have been modeled extensively, albeit within a range of scales rather than infinitely, owing to the practical limits of physical time and space. Models may simulate theoretical fractals or natural phenomena with fractal features. The outputs of the modelling process may be highly artistic renderings, outputs for investigation, or benchmarks for fractal analysis. Some specific applications of fractals to technology are listed elsewhere. Images and other outputs of modelling are normally referred to as being \"fractals\" even if they do not have strictly fractal characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal image that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display artifacts which are not characteristics of true fractals.\n\nModeled fractals may be sounds, digital images, electrochemical patterns, circadian rhythms, etc.\nFractal patterns have been reconstructed in physical 3-dimensional space and virtually, often called \"in silico\" modeling. Models of fractals are generally created using fractal-generating software that implements techniques such as those outlined above. As one illustration, trees, ferns, cells of the nervous system, blood and lung vasculature, and other branching patterns in nature can be modeled on a computer by using recursive algorithms and L-systems techniques. The recursive nature of some patterns is obvious in certain examples\u2014a branch from a tree or a frond from a fern is a miniature replica of the whole: not identical, but similar in nature. Similarly, random fractals have been used to describe/create many highly irregular real-world objects. A limitation of modeling fractals is that resemblance of a fractal model to a natural phenomenon does not prove that the phenomenon being modeled is formed by a process similar to the modeling algorithms.\n\n Natural phenomena with fractal features \n\nApproximate fractals found in nature display self-similarity over extended, but finite, scale ranges. The connection between fractals and leaves, for instance, is currently being used to determine how much carbon is contained in trees.\"Hunting the Hidden Dimension\". Nova. PBS. WPMB-Maryland. October 28, 2008. Phenomena known to have fractal features include: \n\n Actin cytoskeleton\n Algae\n Animal coloration patterns\n Blood vessels and pulmonary vessels\n Coastlines\n Craters\n Crystals\n DNA\n Earthquakes\n Fault lines\n Geometrical optics\n Heart rates\n Heart sounds\n Lightning bolts\n Mountain goat horns\n Mountain ranges\n Ocean waves\n Pineapple\n Psychological subjective perception\n Proteins\n Rings of Saturn\n River networks\n Romanesco broccoli\n Snowflakes\n Soil poresOzhovan M.

Atomic Energy, 74, 241\u2013243 (1993).\nSurfaces in turbulent flows\n Trees\n Brownian motion (generated by a one-dimensional Wiener process).\n\nIn creative works\n\nSince 1999, more than 10 scientific groups have performed fractal analysis on over 50 of Jackson Pollock's (1912\u20131956) paintings which were created by pouring paint directly onto his horizontal canvases Recently, fractal analysis has been used to achieve a 93% success rate in distinguishing real from imitation Pollocks. Cognitive neuroscientists have shown that Pollock's fractals induce the same stress-reduction in observers as computer-generated fractals and Nature's fractals.\n\nDecalcomania, a technique used by artists such as Max Ernst, can produce fractal-like patterns.Frame, Michael; and Mandelbrot, Beno\u00eet B.; A Panorama of Fractals and Their Uses It involves pressing paint between two surfaces and pulling them apart.\n\nCyberneticist Ron Eglash has suggested that fractal geometry and mathematics are prevalent in African art, games, divination, trade, and architecture. Circular houses appear in circles of circles, rectangular houses in rectangles of rectangles, and so on. Such scaling patterns can also be found in African textiles, sculpture, and even cornrow hairstyles.Nelson, Bryn; Sophisticated Mathematics Behind African Village Designs Fractal patterns use repetition on large, small scale, San Francisco Chronicle, Wednesday, February 23, 2009 Hokky Situngkir also suggested the similar properties in Indonesian traditional art, batik, and ornaments found in traditional houses.Situngkir, Hokky; Dahlan, Rolan (2009). Fisika batik: implementasi kreatif melalui sifat fraktal pada batik secara komputasional. Jakarta: Gramedia Pustaka Utama. \n\nEthnomathematician Ron Eglash has discussed the planned layout of Benin city using fractals as the basis, not only in the city itself and the villages but even in the rooms of houses. He commented that \"When Europeans first came to Africa, they considered the architecture very disorganised and thus primitive. It never occurred to them that the Africans might have been using a form of mathematics that they hadn\u2019t even discovered yet.\" Koutonin, Mawuna (18 March 2016). \"Story of cities #5: Benin City, the mighty medieval capital now lost without trace\". Retrieved 2 April 2018.\n\nIn a 1996 interview with Michael Silverblatt, David Foster Wallace admitted that the structure of the first draft of Infinite Jest he gave to his editor Michael Pietsch was inspired by fractals, specifically the Sierpinski triangle (a.k.a. Sierpinski gasket), but that the edited novel is \"more like a lopsided Sierpinsky Gasket\".\n\n Physiological responses \n\nHumans appear to be especially well-adapted to processing fractal patterns with D values between 1.3 and 1.5. When humans view fractal patterns with D values between 1.3 and 1.5, this tends to reduce physiological stress.For further discussion of this effect, see \n\nApplications in technology\n\n Fractal antennas\nFractal transistor\n Fractal heat exchangers\n Digital imaging\n Architecture\n Urban growth\n Classification of histopathology slides\n Fractal landscape or Coastline complexity\n Detecting 'life as we don't know it' by fractal analysis\"Detecting 'life as we don't know it' by fractal analysis\"\n Enzymes (Michaelis-Menten kinetics)\n Generation of new music\n Signal and image compression\n Creation of digital photographic enlargements\n Fractal in soil mechanics\n Computer and video game design\n Computer Graphics\n Organic environments\n Procedural generation\n Fractography and fracture mechanics\n Small angle scattering theory of fractally rough systems\n T-shirts and other fashion\n Generation of patterns for camouflage, such as MARPAT\n Digital sundial\n Technical analysis of price series\n Fractals in networks\n Medicine\n Neuroscience\n Diagnostic Imaging\n Pathology\n Geology\nGeography\n Archaeology\n Soil mechanics\n Seismology\n Search and rescue\n Technical analysis\n Morton order space filling curves for GPU cache coherency in texture mapping, rasterisation and indexing of turbulence data.\n\nIon propulsion\nWhen two-dimensional fractals are iterated many times, the perimeter of the fractal increases up to infinity, but the area may never exceed a certain value. A fractal in three-dimensional space is similar; such a fractal may have an infinite surface area, but never exceed a certain volume.

It makes a close link between model theory that deals with what is true in different models, and proof theory that studies what can be formally proven in particular formal systems.\n\nIt was first proved by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1929. It was then simplified in 1947, when Leon Henkin observed in his Ph.D. thesis that the hard part of the proof can be presented as the Model Existence Theorem (published in 1949). Henkin's proof was simplified by Gisbert Hasenjaeger in 1953.\n\nPreliminaries\nThere are numerous deductive systems for first-order logic, including systems of natural deduction and Hilbert-style systems. Common to all deductive systems is the notion of a formal deduction. This is a sequence (or, in some cases, a finite tree) of formulas with a specially-designated conclusion. The definition of a deduction is such that it is finite and that it is possible to verify algorithmically (by a computer, for example, or by hand) that a given sequence (or tree) of formulas is indeed a deduction.\n\nA first-order formula is called logically valid if it is true in every structure for the language of the formula (i.e. for any assignment of values to the variables of the formula). To formally state, and then prove, the completeness theorem, it is necessary to also define a deductive system. A deductive system is called complete if every logically valid formula is the conclusion of some formal deduction, and the completeness theorem for a particular deductive system is the theorem that it is complete in this sense. Thus, in a sense, there is a different completeness theorem for each deductive system. A converse to completeness is soundness, the fact that only logically valid formulas are provable in the deductive system.\n\nIf some specific deductive system of first-order logic is sound and complete, then it is \"perfect\" (a formula is provable if and only if it is logically valid), thus equivalent to any other deductive system with the same quality (any proof in one system can be converted into the other).\n\nStatement of the theorem\n\nWe first fix a deductive system of first-order predicate calculus, choosing any of the well-known equivalent systems.  G\u00f6del's original proof assumed the Hilbert-Ackermann proof system.\n\nG\u00f6del's original formulation\n\nThe completeness theorem says that if a formula is logically valid then there is a finite deduction (a formal proof) of the formula.\n\nThus, the deductive system is \"complete\" in the sense that no additional inference rules are required to prove all the logically valid formulas. A converse to completeness is soundness, the fact that only logically valid formulas are provable in the deductive system. Together with soundness (whose verification is easy), this theorem implies that a formula is logically valid if and only if it is the conclusion of a formal deduction.\n\nMore general form\n\nThe theorem can be expressed more generally in terms of logical consequence.  We say that a sentence s is a syntactic consequence of a theory T, denoted , if s is provable from T in our deductive system.  We say that s is a semantic consequence of T, denoted , if s holds in every model of T.  The completeness theorem then says that for any first-order theory T with a well-orderable language, and any sentence s in the language of T,\n\nif , then .\n\nSince the converse (soundness) also holds, it follows that  iff , and thus that syntactic and semantic consequence are equivalent for first-order logic.\n\nThis more general theorem is used implicitly, for example, when a sentence is shown to be provable from the axioms of group theory by considering an arbitrary group and showing that the sentence is satisfied by that group.\n\nG\u00f6del's original formulation is deduced by taking the particular case of a theory without any axiom.\n\nModel existence theorem\n\nThe completeness theorem can also be understood in terms of consistency, as a consequence of Henkin's model existence theorem.  We say that a theory T is syntactically consistent if there is no sentence s such that both s and its negation \u00acs are provable from T in our deductive system.  The model existence theorem says that for any first-order theory T with a well-orderable language,\n\nif  is syntactically consistent, then  has a model.\n\nAnother version, with connections to the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, says:\n\nEvery syntactically consistent, countable first-order theory has a finite or countable model.\n\nGiven Henkin's theorem, the completeness theorem can be proved as follows: If , then  does not have models. By the contrapositive of Henkin's, then  is syntactically inconsistent. So a contradiction () is provable from  in the deductive system. Hence , and then by the properties of the deductive system, .\n\nAs a theorem of arithmetic\n\nThe Model Existence Theorem and its proof can be formalized in the framework of Peano arithmetic. Precisely, we can systematically define a model of any consistent effective first-order theory T in Peano arithmetic by interpreting each symbol of T by an arithmetical formula whose free variables are the arguments of the symbol. However, the definition expressed by this formula is not recursive.\n\nConsequences\nAn important consequence of the completeness theorem is that it is possible to recursively enumerate the semantic consequences of any effective first-order theory, by enumerating all the possible formal deductions from the axioms of the theory, and use this to produce an enumeration of their conclusions. \n\nThis comes in contrast with the direct meaning of the notion of semantic consequence, that quantifies over all structures in a particular language, which is clearly not a recursive definition.\n\nAlso, it makes the concept of \"provability,\" and thus of \"theorem,\" a clear concept that only depends on the chosen system of axioms of the theory, and not on the choice of a proof system.\n\nRelationship to the second incompleteness theorem\n\nG\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem (see G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems), another celebrated result, shows that there are inherent limitations in what can be achieved with formal proofs in mathematics. The name for the incompleteness theorem refers to another meaning of complete (see model theory \u2013 Using the compactness and completeness theorems): A theory T  is complete (or decidable) if for every formula f in the language of T either  or .\n\nG\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem states that in any consistent effective theory T containing Peano arithmetic (PA), a formula CT like CT expressing the consistency of T cannot be proven within T.\n\nThe completeness theorem implies the existence of a model of T in which the formula CT is false. Such a model (precisely, the set of \"natural numbers\" it contains) is necessarily a non-standard, as it contains the code number of a proof of a contradiction of T.\nBut T is consistent when viewed from the outside. Thus this code number of a proof of contradiction of T must be a non-standard number.\n\nIn fact, the model of any theory containing PA obtained by the systematic construction of the arithmetical model existence theorem, is always non-standard with a non-equivalent provability predicate and a non-equivalent way to interpret its own construction, so that this construction is non-recursive (as recursive definitions would be unambiguous).\n\nAlso, there is no recursive non-standard model of PA.\n\nRelationship to the compactness theorem\nThe completeness theorem and the compactness theorem are two cornerstones of first-order logic. While neither of these theorems can be proven in a completely effective manner, each one can be effectively obtained from the other.\n\nThe compactness theorem says that if a formula \u03c6 is a logical consequence of a (possibly infinite) set of formulas \u0393 then it is a logical consequence of a finite subset of \u0393. This is an immediate consequence of the completeness theorem, because only a finite number of axioms from \u0393 can be mentioned in a formal deduction of \u03c6, and the soundness of the deductive system then implies \u03c6 is a logical consequence of this finite set. This proof of the compactness theorem is originally due to G\u00f6del.\n\nConversely, for many deductive systems, it is possible to prove the completeness theorem as an effective consequence of the compactness theorem.\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the completeness theorem can be measured along the lines of reverse mathematics. When considered over a countable language, the completeness and compactness theorems are equivalent to each other and equivalent to a weak form of choice known as weak K\u00f6nig's lemma, with the equivalence provable in RCA0 (a second-order variant of Peano arithmetic restricted to induction over  \u03a301 formulas). Weak K\u00f6nig's lemma is provable in ZF, the system of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory without axiom of choice, and thus the completeness and compactness theorems for countable languages are provable in ZF. However the situation is different when the language is of arbitrary large cardinality since then, though the completeness and compactness theorems remain provably equivalent to each other in ZF, they are also provably equivalent to a weak form of the axiom of choice known as the ultrafilter lemma. In particular, no theory extending ZF can prove either the completeness or compactness theorems over arbitrary (possibly uncountable) languages without also proving the ultrafilter lemma on a set of same cardinality, knowing that on countable sets, the ultrafilter lemma becomes equivalent to weak K\u00f6nig's lemma.\n\nCompleteness in other logics\nThe completeness theorem is a central property of first-order logic that does not hold for all logics. Second-order logic, for example, does not have a completeness theorem for its standard semantics (but does have the completeness property for Henkin semantics), and the set of logically-valid formulas in second-order logic is not recursively enumerable. The same is true of all higher-order logics. It is possible to produce sound deductive systems for higher-order logics, but no such system can be complete.\n\nLindstr\u00f6m's theorem states that first-order logic is the strongest (subject to certain constraints) logic satisfying both compactness and completeness.\n\nA completeness theorem can be proved for modal logic or intuitionistic logic with respect to Kripke semantics.\n\nProofs\nG\u00f6del's original proof of the theorem proceeded by reducing the problem to a special case for formulas in a certain syntactic form, and then handling this form with an ad hoc argument.\n\nIn modern logic texts, G\u00f6del's completeness theorem is usually proved with Henkin's proof, rather than with G\u00f6del's original proof. Henkin's proof directly constructs a term model for any consistent first-order theory. James Margetson (2004) developed a computerized formal proof using the Isabelle theorem prover. Other proofs are also known.\n\nSee also\n G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems\n Original proof of G\u00f6del's completeness theorem\n\nFurther reading\n  The first proof of the completeness theorem.\n  The same material as the dissertation, except with briefer proofs, more succinct explanations, and omitting the lengthy introduction.\n\nExternal links\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \"Kurt G\u00f6del\"\u2014by Juliette Kennedy.\nMacTutor biography: Kurt G\u00f6del.\n Detlovs, Vilnis, and Podnieks, Karlis, \"Introduction to mathematical logic.\"\n\nCategory:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics\nCategory:Metatheorems\nCategory:Model theory\nCategory:Proof theory\nCompleteness theorem"}

Before the modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. From 3000 BC the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Akkad and Assyria, together with Ancient Egypt and Ebla began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for purposes of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the field of astronomy and to formulate calendars and record time.\n\nThe most ancient mathematical texts available are from Mesopotamia and Egypt - Plimpton 322 (Babylonian c. 1900 BC),J. Friberg, \"Methods and traditions of Babylonian mathematics. Plimpton 322, Pythagorean triples, and the Babylonian triangle parameter equations\", Historia Mathematica, 8, 1981, pp. 277\u2013318. the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (Egyptian c. 2000\u20131800 BC) Chap. IV \"Egyptian Mathematics and Astronomy\", pp. 71\u201396. and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus (Egyptian c. 1890 BC). All of these texts mention the so-called Pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem, seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.\n\nThe study of mathematics as a \"demonstrative discipline\" begins in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, who coined the term \"mathematics\" from the ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 (mathema), meaning \"subject of instruction\". Greek mathematics greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and mathematical rigor in proofs) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.Sir Thomas L. Heath, A Manual of Greek Mathematics, Dover, 1963, p. 1: \"In the case of mathematics, it is the Greek contribution which it is most essential to know, for it was the Greeks who first made mathematics a science.\" Although they made virtually no contributions to theoretical mathematics, the ancient Romans used applied mathematics in surveying, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, bookkeeping, creation of lunar and solar calendars, and even arts and crafts. Chinese mathematics made early contributions, including a place value system and the first use of negative numbers.George Gheverghese Joseph, The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, Penguin Books, London, 1991, pp. 140\u201348Georges Ifrah, Universalgeschichte der Zahlen, Campus, Frankfurt/New York, 1986, pp. 428\u201337 The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics through the work of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b.Robert Kaplan, \"The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero\", Allen Lane/The Penguin Press, London, 1999\"The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst useful inventions. the importance of this invention is more readily appreciated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Antiquity, Archimedes and Apollonius.\" \u2013 Pierre Simon Laplace http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html Islamic mathematics, in turn, developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations.A.P. Juschkewitsch, \"Geschichte der Mathematik im Mittelalter\", Teubner, Leipzig, 1964 Contemporaneous with but independent of these traditions were the mathematics developed by the Maya civilization of Mexico and Central America, where the concept of zero was given a standard symbol in Maya numerals.\n\nMany Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were translated into Latin from the 12th century onward, leading to further development of mathematics in Medieval Europe. From ancient times through the Middle Ages, periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in Renaissance Italy in the 15th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day. This includes the groundbreaking work of both Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the development of infinitesimal calculus during the course of the 17th century. At the end of the 19th century the International Congress of Mathematicians was founded and continues to spearhead advances in the field.\n\n Prehistoric \nThe origins of mathematical thought lie in the concepts of number, magnitude, and form. Modern studies of animal cognition have shown that these concepts are not unique to humans. Such concepts would have been part of everyday life in hunter-gatherer societies. The idea of the \"number\" concept evolving gradually over time is supported by the existence of languages which preserve the distinction between \"one\", \"two\", and \"many\", but not of numbers larger than two.\n\nPrehistoric artifacts discovered in Africa, dated 20,000 years old or more suggest early attempts to quantify time. The Ishango bone, found near the headwaters of the Nile river (northeastern Congo), may be more than 20,000 years old and consists of a series of marks carved in three columns running the length of the bone. Common interpretations are that the Ishango bone shows either a tally of the earliest known demonstration of sequences of prime numbers or a six-month lunar calendar.Marshack, Alexander (1991): The Roots of Civilization, Colonial Hill, Mount Kisco, NY. Peter Rudman argues that the development of the concept of prime numbers could only have come about after the concept of division, which he dates to after 10,000 BC, with prime numbers probably not being understood until about 500 BC. He also writes that \"no attempt has been made to explain why a tally of something should exhibit multiples of two, prime numbers between 10 and 20, and some numbers that are almost multiples of 10.\" The Ishango bone, according to scholar Alexander Marshack, may have influenced the later development of mathematics in Egypt as, like some entries on the Ishango bone, Egyptian arithmetic also made use of multiplication by 2; this however, is disputed.Marshack, A. 1972. The Roots of Civilization: the Cognitive Beginning of Man\u2019s First Art, Symbol and Notation. New York: McGraw-Hil\n\nPredynastic Egyptians of the 5th millennium BC pictorially represented geometric designs. It has been claimed that megalithic monuments in England and Scotland, dating from the 3rd millennium BC, incorporate geometric ideas such as circles, ellipses, and Pythagorean triples in their design.Thom, Alexander, and Archie Thom, 1988, \"The metrology and geometry of Megalithic Man\", pp. 132\u201351 in C.L.N. Ruggles, ed., Records in Stone: Papers in memory of Alexander Thom. Cambridge University Press. . All of the above are disputed however, and the currently oldest undisputed mathematical documents are from Babylonian and dynastic Egyptian sources.\n\n Babylonian \n\nBabylonian mathematics refers to any mathematics of the peoples of Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) from the days of the early Sumerians through the Hellenistic period almost to the dawn of Christianity. The majority of Babylonian mathematical work comes from two widely separated periods: The first few hundred years of the second millennium BC (Old Babylonian period), and the last few centuries of the first millennium BC (Seleucid period). It is named Babylonian mathematics due to the central role of Babylon as a place of study. Later under the Arab Empire, Mesopotamia, especially Baghdad, once again became an important center of study for Islamic mathematics.\n\nthumb|Geometry problem on a clay tablet belonging to a school for scribes; Susa, first half of the 2nd millennium BCE\nIn contrast to the sparsity of sources in Egyptian mathematics, our knowledge of Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s. Written in Cuneiform script, tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework.\n\nThe earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient Sumerians, who built the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia. They developed a complex system of metrology from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.Duncan J. Melville (2003). Third Millennium Chronology, Third Millennium Mathematics. St. Lawrence University.\n\nthumb|left|The Babylonian mathematical tablet Plimpton 322, dated to 1800 BC.\nBabylonian mathematics were written using a sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. It is likely the sexagesimal system was chosen because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30. Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the decimal system. The power of the Babylonian notational system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different than multiplying integers, similar to our modern notation. The notational system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the Renaissance, and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computation accuracy and power; for example, the Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of  accurate to five decimal places. The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context. By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however it was only used for intermediate positions. This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions, thus the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.\n\nOther topics covered by Babylonian mathematics include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of regular reciprocal pairs. The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving linear, quadratic equations and cubic equations, a remarkable achievement for the time. Tablets from the Old Babylonian period also contain the earliest known statement of the Pythagorean theorem. However, as with Egyptian mathematics, Babylonian mathematics shows no awareness of the difference between exact and approximate solutions, or the solvability of a problem, and most importantly, no explicit statement of the need for proofs or logical principles.\n\n Egyptian \n\nthumb|right|upright=1.5|Image of Problem 14 from the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus. The problem includes a diagram indicating the dimensions of the truncated pyramid.\nEgyptian mathematics refers to mathematics written in the Egyptian language. From the Hellenistic period, Greek replaced Egyptian as the written language of Egyptian scholars. Mathematical study in Egypt later continued under the Arab Empire as part of Islamic mathematics, when Arabic became the written language of Egyptian scholars.\n\nThe most extensive Egyptian mathematical text is the Rhind papyrus (sometimes also called the Ahmes Papyrus after its author), dated to c. 1650 BC but likely a copy of an older document from the Middle Kingdom of about 2000\u20131800 BC. It is an instruction manual for students in arithmetic and geometry. In addition to giving area formulas and methods for multiplication, division and working with unit fractions, it also contains evidence of other mathematical knowledge,Egyptian Unit Fractions at MathPages including composite and prime numbers; arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means; and simplistic understandings of both the Sieve of Eratosthenes and perfect number theory (namely, that of the number 6).[http://mathpages.com/home/kmath340/kmath340.htm Egyptian Unit Fractions] It also shows how to solve first order linear equationsEgyptian Papyri as well as arithmetic and geometric series.Egyptian Algebra \u2013 Mathematicians of the African Diaspora\n\nAnother significant Egyptian mathematical text is the Moscow papyrus, also from the Middle Kingdom period, dated to c. 1890 BC. It consists of what are today called word problems or story problems, which were apparently intended as entertainment. One problem is considered to be of particular importance because it gives a method for finding the volume of a frustum (truncated pyramid).\n\nFinally, the Berlin Papyrus 6619 (c. 1800 BC) shows that ancient Egyptians could solve a second-order algebraic equation.Egyptian Mathematical Papyri \u2013 Mathematicians of the African Diaspora\n\n Greek \n\nthumb|left|The Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagoreans are generally credited with the first proof of the theorem.\nGreek mathematics refers to the mathematics written in the Greek language from the time of Thales of Miletus (~600 BC) to the closure of the Academy of Athens in 529 AD.Howard Eves, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990,  Greek mathematicians lived in cities spread over the entire Eastern Mediterranean, from Italy to North Africa, but were united by culture and language. Greek mathematics of the period following Alexander the Great is sometimes called Hellenistic mathematics.\n\nGreek mathematics was much more sophisticated than the mathematics that had been developed by earlier cultures. All surviving records of pre-Greek mathematics show the use of inductive reasoning, that is, repeated observations used to establish rules of thumb. Greek mathematicians, by contrast, used deductive reasoning. The Greeks used logic to derive conclusions from definitions and axioms, and used mathematical rigor to prove them.Martin Bernal, \"Animadversions on the Origins of Western Science\", pp. 72\u201383 in Michael H. Shank, ed., The Scientific Enterprise in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) 2000, p. 75.\n\nGreek mathematics is thought to have begun with Thales of Miletus (c. 624\u2013c.546 BC) and Pythagoras of Samos (c. 582\u2013c. 507 BC). Although the extent of the influence is disputed, they were probably inspired by Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics. According to legend, Pythagoras traveled to Egypt to learn mathematics, geometry, and astronomy from Egyptian priests.\n\nThales used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales' Theorem. As a result, he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. Pythagoras established the Pythagorean School, whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was \"All is number\". It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term \"mathematics\", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins. The Pythagoreans are credited with the first proof of the Pythagorean theorem,Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, . though the statement of the theorem has a long history, and with the proof of the existence of irrational numbers. Although he was preceded by the Babylonians and the Chinese, the Neopythagorean mathematician Nicomachus (60\u2013120 AD) provided one of the earliest Greco-Roman multiplication tables, whereas the oldest extant Greek multiplication table is found on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD (now found in the British Museum).David E. Smith (1958), History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics, New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), , pp. 58, 129. The association of the Neopythagoreans with the Western invention of the multiplication table is evident in its later Medieval name: the mensa Pythagorica.David E. Smith (1958), History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics, New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), , p. 129.\n\nPlato (428/427 BC \u2013 348/347 BC) is important in the history of mathematics for inspiring and guiding others. His Platonic Academy, in Athens, became the mathematical center of the world in the 4th century BC, and it was from this school that the leading mathematicians of the day, such as Eudoxus of Cnidus, came. Plato also discussed the foundations of mathematics, clarified some of the definitions (e.g. that of a line as \"breadthless length\"), and reorganized the assumptions. The analytic method is ascribed to Plato, while a formula for obtaining Pythagorean triples bears his name.\n\nEudoxus (408\u2013c. 355 BC) developed the method of exhaustion, a precursor of modern integration and a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of incommensurable magnitudes. The former allowed the calculations of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures, while the latter enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances in geometry. Though he made no specific technical mathematical discoveries, Aristotle (384\u2013c. 322 BC) contributed significantly to the development of mathematics by laying the foundations of logic.\n\nright|thumb|One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's Elements, found at Oxyrhynchus and dated to circa AD 100. The diagram accompanies Book II, Proposition 5.\nIn the 3rd century BC, the premier center of mathematical education and research was the Musaeum of Alexandria. It was there that Euclid (c. 300 BC) taught, and wrote the Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time. The Elements introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework. The Elements was known to all educated people in the West up through the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today.Howard Eves, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990,  p. 141: \"No work, except The Bible, has been more widely used....\" In addition to the familiar theorems of Euclidean geometry, the Elements was meant as an introductory textbook to all mathematical subjects of the time, such as number theory, algebra and solid geometry, including proofs that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Euclid also wrote extensively on other subjects, such as conic sections, optics, spherical geometry, and mechanics, but only half of his writings survive.\n\nthumb|left|upright=1.2|Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to approximate the value of pi.\nArchimedes (c. 287\u2013212 BC) of Syracuse, widely considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity, used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus. He also showed one could use the method of exhaustion to calculate the value of \u03c0 with as much precision as desired, and obtained the most accurate value of \u03c0 then known, . He also studied the spiral bearing his name, obtained formulas for the volumes of surfaces of revolution (paraboloid, ellipsoid, hyperboloid), and an ingenious method of exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. While he is also known for his contributions to physics and several advanced mechanical devices, Archimedes himself placed far greater value on the products of his thought and general mathematical principles. He regarded as his greatest achievement his finding of the surface area and volume of a sphere, which he obtained by proving these are 2/3 the surface area and volume of a cylinder circumscribing the sphere.\n\nthumb|right|upright=1.25|Apollonius of Perga made significant advances in the study of conic sections.\nApollonius of Perga (c. 262\u2013190 BC) made significant advances to the study of conic sections, showing that one can obtain all three varieties of conic section by varying the angle of the plane that cuts a double-napped cone. He also coined the terminology in use today for conic sections, namely parabola (\"place beside\" or \"comparison\"), \"ellipse\" (\"deficiency\"), and \"hyperbola\" (\"a throw beyond\"). His work Conics is one of the best known and preserved mathematical works from antiquity, and in it he derives many theorems concerning conic sections that would prove invaluable to later mathematicians and astronomers studying planetary motion, such as Isaac Newton. While neither Apollonius nor any other Greek mathematicians made the leap to coordinate geometry, Apollonius' treatment of curves is in some ways similar to the modern treatment, and some of his work seems to anticipate the development of analytical geometry by Descartes some 1800 years later.\n\nAround the same time, Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276\u2013194 BC) devised the Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers. The 3rd century BC is generally regarded as the \"Golden Age\" of Greek mathematics, with advances in pure mathematics henceforth in relative decline. Nevertheless, in the centuries that followed significant advances were made in applied mathematics, most notably trigonometry, largely to address the needs of astronomers. Hipparchus of Nicaea (c. 190\u2013120 BC) is considered the founder of trigonometry for compiling the first known trigonometric table, and to him is also due the systematic use of the 360 degree circle. Heron of Alexandria (c. 10\u201370 AD) is credited with Heron's formula for finding the area of a scalene triangle and with being the first to recognize the possibility of negative numbers possessing square roots.S.C.

Menelaus of Alexandria (c. 100 AD) pioneered spherical trigonometry through Menelaus' theorem. The most complete and influential trigonometric work of antiquity is the Almagest of Ptolemy (c. AD 90\u2013168), a landmark astronomical treatise whose trigonometric tables would be used by astronomers for the next thousand years. Ptolemy is also credited with Ptolemy's theorem for deriving trigonometric quantities, and the most accurate value of \u03c0 outside of China until the medieval period, 3.1416.\n\nthumb|right|upright|Title page of the 1621 edition of Diophantus' Arithmetica, translated into Latin by Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac.\nFollowing a period of stagnation after Ptolemy, the period between 250 and 350 AD is sometimes referred to as the \"Silver Age\" of Greek mathematics. During this period, Diophantus made significant advances in algebra, particularly indeterminate analysis, which is also known as \"Diophantine analysis\". The study of Diophantine equations and Diophantine approximations is a significant area of research to this day. His main work was the Arithmetica, a collection of 150 algebraic problems dealing with exact solutions to determinate and indeterminate equations. The Arithmetica had a significant influence on later mathematicians, such as Pierre de Fermat, who arrived at his famous Last Theorem after trying to generalize a problem he had read in the Arithmetica (that of dividing a square into two squares). Diophantus also made significant advances in notation, the Arithmetica being the first instance of algebraic symbolism and syncopation.\n\nthumb|left|The Hagia Sophia was designed by mathematicians Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus.\nAmong the last great Greek mathematicians is Pappus of Alexandria (4th  century AD).  He is known for his hexagon theorem and centroid theorem, as well as the Pappus configuration and Pappus graph. His Collection is a major source of knowledge on Greek mathematics as most of it has survived. Pappus is considered the last major innovator in Greek mathematics, with subsequent work consisting mostly of commentaries on earlier work.\n\nThe first woman mathematician recorded by history was Hypatia of Alexandria (AD 350\u2013415). She succeeded her father (Theon of Alexandria) as Librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the Christian community in Alexandria had her stripped publicly and executed.Medieval Sourcebook: Socrates Scholasticus: The Murder of Hypatia (late 4th Cent.) from Ecclesiastical History, Bk VI: Chap. 15 Her death is sometimes taken as the end of the era of the Alexandrian Greek mathematics, although work did continue in Athens for another century with figures such as Proclus, Simplicius and Eutocius.  Although Proclus and Simplicius were more philosophers than mathematicians, their commentaries on earlier works are valuable sources on Greek mathematics.  The closure of the neo-Platonic Academy of Athens by the emperor Justinian in 529 AD is traditionally held as marking the end of the era of Greek mathematics, although the Greek tradition continued unbroken in the Byzantine empire with mathematicians such as Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus, the architects of the Hagia Sophia.  Nevertheless, Byzantine mathematics consisted mostly of commentaries, with little in the way of innovation, and the centers of mathematical innovation were to be found elsewhere by this time.\n\nRoman\n\nthumb|Equipment used by an ancient Roman land surveyor (gromatici), found at the site of Aquincum, modern Budapest, Hungary\nAlthough ethnic Greek mathematicians continued under the rule of the late Roman Republic and subsequent Roman Empire, there were no noteworthy native Latin mathematicians in comparison. Ancient Romans such as Cicero (106\u201343 BC), an influential Roman statesman who studied mathematics in Greece, believed that Roman surveyors and calculators were far more interested in applied mathematics than the theoretical mathematics and geometry that were prized by the Greeks. It is unclear if the Romans first derived their numerical system directly from the Greek precedent or from Etruscan numerals used by the Etruscan civilization centered in what is now Tuscany, central Italy.\n\nUsing calculation, Romans were adept at both instigating and detecting financial fraud, as well as managing taxes for the treasury. Siculus Flaccus, one of the Roman gromatici (i.e. land surveyor), wrote the Categories of Fields, which aided Roman surveyors in measuring the surface areas of allotted lands and territories. Aside from managing trade and taxes, the Romans also regularly applied mathematics to solve problems in engineering, including the erection of architecture such as bridges, road-building, and preparation for military campaigns. Arts and crafts such as Roman mosaics, inspired by previous Greek designs, created illusionist geometric patterns and rich, detailed scenes that required precise measurements for each tessera tile, the opus tessellatum pieces on average measuring eight millimeters square and the finer opus vermiculatum pieces having an average surface of four millimeters square.\n\nThe creation of the Roman calendar also necessitated basic mathematics. The first calendar allegedly dates back to 8th century BC during the Roman Kingdom and included 356 days plus a leap year every other year. In contrast, the lunar calendar of the Republican era contained 355 days, roughly ten-and-one-fourth days shorter than the solar year, a discrepancy that was solved by adding an extra month into the calendar after the 23rd of February. This calendar was supplanted by the Julian calendar, a solar calendar organized by Julius Caesar (100\u201344 BC) and devised by Sosigenes of Alexandria to include a leap day every four years in a 365-day cycle. This calendar, which contained an error of 11 minutes and 14 seconds, was later corrected by the Gregorian calendar organized by Pope Gregory XIII (), virtually the same solar calendar used in modern times as the international standard calendar.\n\nAt roughly the same time, the Han Chinese and the Romans both invented the wheeled odometer device for measuring distances traveled, the Roman model first described by the Roman civil engineer and architect Vitruvius (c. 80 BC - c. 15 BC). The device was used at least until the reign of emperor Commodus (), but its design seems to have been lost until experiments were made during the 15th century in Western Europe. Perhaps relying on similar gear-work and technology found in the Antikythera mechanism, the odometer of Vitruvius featured chariot wheels measuring 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter turning four-hundred times in one Roman mile (roughly 4590\u00a0ft/1400 m). With each revolution, a pin-and-axle device engaged a 400-tooth cogwheel that turned a second gear responsible for dropping pebbles into a box, each pebble representing one mile traversed.\n\n Chinese \n\nthumb|right|upright|The Tsinghua Bamboo Slips, containing the world's earliest decimal multiplication table, dated 305 BC during the Warring States period\nAn analysis of early Chinese mathematics has demonstrated its unique development compared to other parts of the world, leading scholars to assume an entirely independent development. The oldest extant mathematical text from China is the Zhoubi Suanjing, variously dated to between 1200 BC and 100 BC, though a date of about 300 BC during the Warring States Period appears reasonable. However, the Tsinghua Bamboo Slips, containing the earliest known decimal multiplication table (although ancient Babylonians had ones with a base of 60), is dated around 305 BC and is perhaps the oldest surviving mathematical text of China.\n\nthumb|left|Counting rod numerals\nOf particular note is the use in Chinese mathematics of a decimal positional notation system, the so-called \"rod numerals\" in which distinct ciphers were used for numbers between 1 and 10, and additional ciphers for powers of ten. Thus, the number 123 would be written using the symbol for \"1\", followed by the symbol for \"100\", then the symbol for \"2\" followed by the symbol for \"10\", followed by the symbol for \"3\". This was the most advanced number system in the world at the time, apparently in use several centuries before the common era and well before the development of the Indian numeral system. Rod numerals allowed the representation of numbers as large as desired and allowed calculations to be carried out on the suan pan, or Chinese abacus. The date of the invention of the suan pan is not certain, but the earliest written mention dates from AD 190, in Xu Yue's Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures.\n\nThe oldest existent work on geometry in China comes from the philosophical Mohist canon c. 330 BC, compiled by the followers of Mozi (470\u2013390 BC). The Mo Jing described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small number of geometrical theorems as well. It also defined the concepts of circumference, diameter, radius, and volume.\n\nthumb|upright|right|The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, one of the earliest surviving mathematical texts from China (2nd century AD).\nIn 212 BC, the Emperor Qin Shi Huang commanded all books in the Qin Empire other than officially sanctioned ones be burned. This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the book burning of 212 BC, the Han dynasty (202 BC\u2013220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for Chinese pagoda towers, engineering, surveying, and includes material on right triangles. It created mathematical proof for the Pythagorean theorem, and a mathematical formula for Gaussian elimination. The treatise also provides values of \u03c0, which Chinese mathematicians originally approximated as 3 until Liu Xin (d. 23 AD) provided a figure of 3.1457 and subsequently Zhang Heng (78\u2013139) approximated pi as 3.1724, as well as 3.162 by taking the square root of 10. Liu Hui commented on the Nine Chapters in the 3rd century AD and gave a value of \u03c0 accurate to 5 decimal places (i.e. 3.14159). Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th century AD Zu Chongzhi computed the value of \u03c0 to seven decimal places (i.e. 3.141592), which remained the most accurate value of \u03c0 for almost the next 1000 years. He also established a method which would later be called Cavalieri's principle to find the volume of a sphere. Extract of p. 27\n\nThe high-water mark of Chinese mathematics occurred in the 13th century during the latter half of the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), with the development of Chinese algebra. The most important text from that period is the Precious Mirror of the Four Elements by Zhu Shijie (1249\u20131314), dealing with the solution of simultaneous higher order algebraic equations using a method similar to Horner's method. The Precious Mirror also contains a diagram of Pascal's triangle with coefficients of binomial expansions through the eighth power, though both appear in Chinese works as early as 1100. The Chinese also made use of the complex combinatorial diagram known as the magic square and magic circles, described in ancient times and perfected by Yang Hui (AD 1238\u20131298).\n\nEven after European mathematics began to flourish during the Renaissance, European and Chinese mathematics were separate traditions, with significant Chinese mathematical output in decline from the 13th century onwards. Jesuit missionaries such as Matteo Ricci carried mathematical ideas back and forth between the two cultures from the 16th to 18th centuries, though at this point far more mathematical ideas were entering China than leaving.\n\nJapanese mathematics, Korean mathematics, and Vietnamese mathematics are traditionally viewed as stemming from Chinese mathematics and belonging to the Confucian-based East Asian cultural sphere. Korean and Japanese mathematics were heavily influenced by the algebraic works produced during China's Song dynasty, whereas Vietnamese mathematics was heavily indebted to popular works of China's Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644). For instance, although Vietnamese mathematical treatises were written in either Chinese or the native Vietnamese Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m script, all of them followed the Chinese format of presenting a collection of problems with algorithms for solving them, followed by numerical answers. Mathematics in Vietnam and Korea were mostly associated with the professional court bureaucracy of mathematicians and astronomers, whereas in Japan it was more prevalent in the realm of private schools.\n\n Indian \n\nthumb|right|upright=1.5|The numerals used in the Bakhshali manuscript, dated between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE.\n\nThe earliest civilization on the Indian subcontinent is the Indus Valley Civilization (mature phase: 2600 to 1900 BC) that flourished in the Indus river basin. Their cities were laid out with geometric regularity, but no known mathematical documents survive from this civilization.\n\nThe oldest extant mathematical records from India are the Sulba Sutras (dated variously between the 8th century BC and the 2nd century AD), appendices to religious texts which give simple rules for constructing altars of various shapes, such as squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and others. As with Egypt, the preoccupation with temple functions points to an origin of mathematics in religious ritual. The Sulba Sutras give methods for constructing a circle with approximately the same area as a given square, which imply several different approximations of the value of \u03c0. In addition, they compute the square root of 2 to several decimal places, list Pythagorean triples, and give a statement of the Pythagorean theorem. All of these results are present in Babylonian mathematics, indicating Mesopotamian influence. It is not known to what extent the Sulba Sutras influenced later Indian mathematicians. As in China, there is a lack of continuity in Indian mathematics; significant advances are separated by long periods of inactivity.\n\nP\u0101\u1e47ini (c. 5th century BC) formulated the rules for Sanskrit grammar. His notation was similar to modern mathematical notation, and used metarules, transformations, and recursion. Pingala (roughly 3rd\u20131st centuries BC) in his treatise of prosody uses a device corresponding to a binary numeral system.W.S. Anglin and J. Lambek, The Heritage of Thales, Springer, 1995,  His discussion of the combinatorics of meters corresponds to an elementary version of the binomial theorem. Pingala's work also contains the basic ideas of Fibonacci numbers (called m\u0101tr\u0101meru).\n\nThe next significant mathematical documents from India after the Sulba Sutras are the Siddhantas, astronomical treatises from the 4th and 5th centuries AD (Gupta period) showing strong Hellenistic influence. They are significant in that they contain the first instance of trigonometric relations based on the half-chord, as is the case in modern trigonometry, rather than the full chord, as was the case in Ptolemaic trigonometry. Through a series of translation errors, the words \"sine\" and \"cosine\" derive from the Sanskrit \"jiya\" and \"kojiya\".\n\nupright|left|thumb|Explanation of the sine rule in Yuktibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101\nAround 500 AD, Aryabhata wrote the Aryabhatiya, a slim volume, written in verse, intended to supplement the rules of calculation used in astronomy and mathematical mensuration, though with no feeling for logic or deductive methodology. Though about half of the entries are wrong, it is in the Aryabhatiya that the decimal place-value system first appears. Several centuries later, the Muslim mathematician Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Aryabhatiya as a \"mix of common pebbles and costly crystals\".\n\nIn the 7th century, Brahmagupta identified the Brahmagupta theorem, Brahmagupta's identity and Brahmagupta's formula, and for the first time, in Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta, he lucidly explained the use of zero as both a placeholder and decimal digit, and explained the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system. It was from a translation of this Indian text on mathematics (c. 770) that Islamic mathematicians were introduced to this numeral system, which they adapted as Arabic numerals. Islamic scholars carried knowledge of this number system to Europe by the 12th century, and it has now displaced all older number systems throughout the world. Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, all of which evolved from the Brahmi numerals. Each of the roughly dozen major scripts of India has its own numeral glyphs. In the 10th century, Halayudha's commentary on Pingala's work contains a study of the Fibonacci sequence and Pascal's triangle, and describes the formation of a matrix.\n\nIn the 12th century, Bh\u0101skara IIPlofker 2009 182\u2013207 lived in southern India and wrote extensively on all then known branches of mathematics. His work contains mathematical objects equivalent or approximately equivalent to infinitesimals, derivatives, the mean value theorem and the derivative of the sine function. To what extent he anticipated the invention of calculus is a controversial subject among historians of mathematics.Plofker 2009 pp. 197\u201398; George Gheverghese Joseph, The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, Penguin Books, London, 1991 pp. 298\u2013300; Takao Hayashi, Indian Mathematics, pp. 118\u201330 in Companion History of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences, ed. I. Grattan.Guinness, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London, 1994, p. 126\n\nIn the 14th century, Madhava of Sangamagrama, the founder of the so-called Kerala School of Mathematics, found the Madhava\u2013Leibniz series and obtained from it a transformed series, whose first 21 terms he used to compute the value of \u03c0 as 3.14159265359. Madhava also found the Madhava-Gregory series to determine the arctangent, the Madhava-Newton power series to determine sine and cosine and the Taylor approximation for sine and cosine functions.Plofker 2009 pp. 217\u201353 In the 16th century, Jyesthadeva consolidated many of the Kerala School's developments and theorems in the Yukti-bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101.P.P. Divakaran, The first textbook of calculus: Yukti-bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, Journal of Indian Philosophy 35, 2007, pp. 417\u201333. However, the Kerala School did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.\n\n Islamic empire \n\nthumb|Page from The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing by Muhammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (c.\u00a0AD 820)\nThe Islamic Empire established across Persia, the Middle East, Central Asia, North Africa, Iberia, and in parts of India in the 8th century made significant contributions towards mathematics. Although most Islamic texts on mathematics were written in Arabic, most of them were not written by Arabs, since much like the status of Greek in the Hellenistic world, Arabic was used as the written language of non-Arab scholars throughout the Islamic world at the time. Persians contributed to the world of Mathematics alongside Arabs.\n\nIn the 9th century, the Persian mathematician Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b wrote several important books on the Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals, written about 825, along with the work of Al-Kindi, were instrumental in spreading Indian mathematics and Indian numerals to the West. The word algorithm is derived from the Latinization of his name, Algoritmi, and the word algebra from the title of one of his works, Al-Kit\u0101b al-mukhta\u1e63ar f\u012b h\u012bs\u0101b al-\u011fabr wa\u2019l-muq\u0101bala (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing). He gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots, \"The six cases of equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic equations having positive root. So systematic and exhaustive was al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b's exposition that his readers must have had little difficulty in mastering the solutions.\" and he was the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake.Gandz and Saloman (1936), The sources of Khwarizmi's algebra, Osiris i, pp. 263\u201377: \"In a sense, Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called \"the father of algebra\" than Diophantus because Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers\". He also discussed the fundamental method of \"reduction\" and \"balancing\", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b originally described as al-jabr. \"It is not certain just what the terms al-jabr and muqabalah mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word al-jabr presumably meant something like \"restoration\" or \"completion\" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word muqabalah is said to refer to \"reduction\" or \"balancing\" \u2013 that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.\" His algebra was also no longer concerned \"with a series of problems to be resolved, but an exposition which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study.\" He also studied an equation for its own sake and \"in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems.\"\n\nIn Egypt, Abu Kamil extended algebra to the set of irrational numbers, accepting square roots and fourth roots as solutions and coefficients to quadratic equations. He also developed techniques used to solve three non-linear simultaneous equations with three unknown variables. One unique feature of his works was trying to find all the possible solutions to some of his problems, including one where he found 2676 solutions. His works formed an important foundation for the development of algebra and influenced later mathematicians, such as al-Karaji and Fibonacci.\n\nFurther developments in algebra were made by Al-Karaji in his treatise al-Fakhri, where he extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities. Something close to a proof by mathematical induction appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the binomial theorem, Pascal's triangle, and the sum of integral cubes. The historian of mathematics, F. Woepcke,F. Woepcke (1853). Extrait du Fakhri, trait\u00e9 d'Alg\u00e8bre par Abou Bekr Mohammed Ben Alhacan Alkarkhi. Paris. praised Al-Karaji for being \"the first who introduced the theory of algebraic calculus.\" Also in the 10th century, Abul Wafa translated the works of Diophantus into Arabic. Ibn al-Haytham was the first mathematician to derive the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. He performed an integration in order to find the volume of a paraboloid, and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of polynomials up to the fourth degree. He thus came close to finding a general formula for the integrals of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any polynomials higher than the fourth degree.\n\nIn the late 11th century, Omar Khayyam wrote Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid, a book about what he perceived as flaws in Euclid's Elements, especially the parallel postulate. He was also the first to find the general geometric solution to cubic equations. He was also very influential in calendar reform.\n\nIn the 13th century, Nasir al-Din Tusi (Nasireddin) made advances in spherical trigonometry. He also wrote influential work on Euclid's parallel postulate. In the 15th century, Ghiyath al-Kashi computed the value of \u03c0 to the 16th decimal place. Kashi also had an algorithm for calculating nth roots, which was a special case of the methods given many centuries later by Ruffini and Horner.\n\nOther achievements of Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the decimal point notation to the Arabic numerals, the discovery of all the modern trigonometric functions besides the sine, al-Kindi's introduction of cryptanalysis and frequency analysis, the development of analytic geometry by Ibn al-Haytham, the beginning of algebraic geometry by Omar Khayyam and the development of an algebraic notation by al-Qalas\u0101d\u012b.\n\nDuring the time of the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Empire from the 15th century, the development of Islamic mathematics became stagnant.\n\n Maya \nthumb|The Maya numerals for numbers 1 through 19, written in the Maya script\nIn the Pre-Columbian Americas, the Maya civilization that flourished in Mexico and Central America during the 1st millennium AD developed a unique tradition of mathematics that, due to its geographic isolation, was entirely independent of existing European, Egyptian, and Asian mathematics. Maya numerals utilized a base of 20, the vigesimal system, instead of a base of ten that forms the basis of the decimal system used by most modern cultures. The Mayas used mathematics to create the Maya calendar as well as to predict astronomical phenomena in their native Maya astronomy. While the concept of zero had to be inferred in the mathematics of many contemporary cultures, the Mayas developed a standard symbol for it.\n\n Medieval European \n\nMedieval European interest in mathematics was driven by concerns quite different from those of modern mathematicians. One driving element was the belief that mathematics provided the key to understanding the created order of nature, frequently justified by Plato's Timaeus and the biblical passage (in the Book of Wisdom) that God had ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight.Wisdom, 11:21\n\nBoethius provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term quadrivium to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote De institutione arithmetica, a free translation from the Greek of Nicomachus's Introduction to Arithmetic; De institutione musica, also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from Euclid's Elements. His works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.Caldwell, John (1981) \"The De Institutione Arithmetica and the De Institutione Musica\", pp. 135\u201354 in Margaret Gibson, ed., Boethius: His Life, Thought, and Influence, (Oxford: Basil Blackwell).Folkerts, Menso, \"Boethius\" Geometrie II, (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1970).\n\nIn the 12th century, European scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily seeking scientific Arabic texts, including al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b's The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, translated into Latin by Robert of Chester, and the complete text of Euclid's Elements, translated in various versions by Adelard of Bath, Herman of Carinthia, and Gerard of Cremona.Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d'Alverny, \"Translations and Translators\", pp. 421\u201362 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).Guy Beaujouan, \"The Transformation of the Quadrivium\", pp. 463\u201387 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).  These and other new sources sparked a renewal of mathematics.\n\nLeonardo of Pisa, now known as Fibonacci, serendipitously learned about the Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals on a trip to what is now B\u00e9ja\u00efa, Algeria with his merchant father.  (Europe was still using Roman numerals.)  There, he observed a system of arithmetic (specifically algorism) which due to the positional notation of Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals was much more efficient and greatly facilitated commerce.  Leonardo wrote Liber Abaci in 1202 (updated in 1254) introducing the technique to Europe and beginning a long period of popularizing it.  The book also brought to Europe what is now known as the Fibonacci sequence (known to Indian mathematicians for hundreds of years before that) which was used as an unremarkable example within the text.\n\nThe 14th century saw the development of new mathematical concepts to investigate a wide range of problems.Grant, Edward and John E. Murdoch (1987), eds., Mathematics and Its Applications to Science and Natural Philosophy in the Middle Ages, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) . One important contribution was development of mathematics of local motion.\n\nThomas Bradwardine proposed that speed (V) increases in arithmetic proportion as the ratio of force (F) to resistance (R) increases in geometric proportion. Bradwardine expressed this by a series of specific examples, but although the logarithm had not yet been conceived, we can express his conclusion anachronistically by writing:\nV = log (F/R).Clagett, Marshall (1961) The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 421\u201340. Bradwardine's analysis is an example of transferring a mathematical technique used by al-Kindi and Arnald of Villanova to quantify the nature of compound medicines to a different physical problem.Murdoch, John E. (1969) \"Mathesis in Philosophiam Scholasticam Introducta: The Rise and Development of the Application of Mathematics in Fourteenth Century Philosophy and Theology\", in Arts lib\u00e9raux et philosophie au Moyen \u00c2ge (Montr\u00e9al: Institut d'\u00c9tudes M\u00e9di\u00e9vales), at pp. 224\u201327.\n\nthumb|right|Nicole Oresme (1323\u20131382), shown in this contemporary illuminated manuscript with an armillary sphere in the foreground, was the first to offer a mathematical proof for the divergence of the harmonic series.\nOne of the 14th-century Oxford Calculators, William Heytesbury, lacking differential calculus and the concept of limits, proposed to measure instantaneous speed \"by the path that would be described by [a body] if... it were moved uniformly at the same degree of speed with which it is moved in that given instant\".Clagett, Marshall (1961) The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 210, 214\u201315, 236.\n\nHeytesbury and others mathematically determined the distance covered by a body undergoing uniformly accelerated motion (today solved by integration), stating that \"a moving body uniformly acquiring or losing that increment [of speed] will traverse in some given time a [distance] completely equal to that which it would traverse if it were moving continuously through the same time with the mean degree [of speed]\".Clagett, Marshall (1961) The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), p. 284.\n\nNicole Oresme at the University of Paris and the Italian Giovanni di Casali independently provided graphical demonstrations of this relationship, asserting that the area under the line depicting the constant acceleration, represented the total distance traveled.Clagett, Marshall (1961) The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 332\u201345, 382\u201391. In a later mathematical commentary on Euclid's Elements, Oresme made a more detailed general analysis in which he demonstrated that a body will acquire in each successive increment of time an increment of any quality that increases as the odd numbers. Since Euclid had demonstrated the sum of the odd numbers are the square numbers, the total quality acquired by the body increases as the square of the time.Nicole Oresme, \"Questions on the Geometry of Euclid\" Q. 14, pp. 560\u201365, in Marshall Clagett, ed., Nicole Oresme and the Medieval Geometry of Qualities and Motions, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1968).\n\n Renaissance \n\nDuring the Renaissance, the development of mathematics and of accounting were intertwined.Heeffer, Albrecht: On the curious historical coincidence of algebra and double-entry bookkeeping, Foundations of the Formal Sciences, Ghent University, November 2009, p. 7  While there is no direct relationship between algebra and accounting, the teaching of the subjects and the books published often intended for the children of merchants who were sent to reckoning schools (in Flanders and Germany) or abacus schools (known as abbaco in Italy), where they learned the skills useful for trade and commerce. There is probably no need for algebra in performing bookkeeping operations, but for complex bartering operations or the calculation of compound interest, a basic knowledge of arithmetic was mandatory and knowledge of algebra was very useful.\n\nPiero della Francesca (c. 1415\u20131492) wrote books on solid geometry and linear perspective, including De Prospectiva Pingendi (On Perspective for Painting), Trattato d\u2019Abaco (Abacus Treatise), and De corporibus regularibus (Regular Solids).della Francesca, Piero.

Mancini, Rome, (1916).\n\nthumb|left|Portrait of Luca Pacioli, a painting traditionally attributed to Jacopo de' Barbari, 1495, (Museo di Capodimonte).\nLuca Pacioli's Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalit\u00e0 (Italian: \"Review of Arithmetic, Geometry, Ratio and Proportion\") was first printed and published in Venice in 1494. It included a 27-page treatise on bookkeeping, \"Particularis de Computis et Scripturis\" (Italian: \"Details of Calculation and Recording\"). It was written primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a source of pleasure from the mathematical puzzles it contained, and to aid the education of their sons.Alan Sangster, Greg Stoner & Patricia McCarthy: \"The market for Luca Pacioli\u2019s Summa Arithmetica\" (Accounting, Business & Financial History Conference, Cardiff, September 2007) pp. 1\u20132 In Summa Arithmetica, Pacioli introduced symbols for plus and minus for the first time in a printed book, symbols that became standard notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. Summa Arithmetica was also the first known book printed in Italy to contain algebra. Pacioli obtained many of his ideas from Piero Della Francesca whom he plagiarized.\n\nIn Italy, during the first half of the 16th century, Scipione del Ferro and Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia discovered solutions for cubic equations. Gerolamo Cardano published them in his 1545 book Ars Magna, together with a solution for the quartic equations, discovered by his student Lodovico Ferrari. In 1572 Rafael Bombelli published his L'Algebra in which he showed how to deal with the imaginary quantities that could appear in Cardano's formula for solving cubic equations.\n\nSimon Stevin's book De Thiende ('the art of tenths'), first published in Dutch in 1585, contained the first systematic treatment of decimal notation, which influenced all later work on the real number system.\n\nDriven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large areas, trigonometry grew to be a major branch of mathematics. Bartholomaeus Pitiscus was the first to use the word, publishing his Trigonometria in 1595. Regiomontanus's table of sines and cosines was published in 1533.\n\nDuring the Renaissance the desire of artists to represent the natural world realistically, together with the rediscovered philosophy of the Greeks, led artists to study mathematics. They were also the engineers and architects of that time, and so had need of mathematics in any case. The art of painting in perspective, and the developments in geometry that involved, were studied intensely.\n\nMathematics during the Scientific Revolution\n17th century\nthumb|upright|left|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\nThe 17th century saw an unprecedented increase of mathematical and scientific ideas across Europe. Galileo observed the moons of Jupiter in orbit about that planet, using a telescope based on a toy imported from Holland. Tycho Brahe had gathered an enormous quantity of mathematical data describing the positions of the planets in the sky. By his position as Brahe's assistant, Johannes Kepler was first exposed to and seriously interacted with the topic of planetary motion. Kepler's calculations were made simpler by the contemporaneous invention of logarithms by John Napier and Jost B\u00fcrgi. Kepler succeeded in formulating mathematical laws of planetary motion.\nThe analytic geometry developed by Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) allowed those orbits to be plotted on a graph, in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nBuilding on earlier work by many predecessors, Isaac Newton discovered the laws of physics explaining Kepler's Laws, and brought together the concepts now known as calculus. Independently, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who is arguably one of the most important mathematicians of the 17th century, developed calculus and much of the calculus notation still in use today. Science and mathematics had become an international endeavor, which would soon spread over the entire world.Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, , p. 379, \"...the concepts of calculus...(are) so far reaching and have exercised such an impact on the modern world that it is perhaps correct to say that without some knowledge of them a person today can scarcely claim to be well educated.\"\n\nIn addition to the application of mathematics to the studies of the heavens, applied mathematics began to expand into new areas, with the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal. Pascal and Fermat set the groundwork for the investigations of probability theory and the corresponding rules of combinatorics in their discussions over a game of gambling. Pascal, with his wager, attempted to use the newly developing probability theory to argue for a life devoted to religion, on the grounds that even if the probability of success was small, the rewards were infinite. In some sense, this foreshadowed the development of utility theory in the 18th\u201319th century.\n\n 18th century \nright|thumb|upright|Leonhard Euler by Emanuel Handmann.\n\nThe most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguably Leonhard Euler. His contributions range from founding the study of graph theory with the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg problem to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and notations. For example, he named the square root of minus 1 with the symbol i, and he popularized the use of the Greek letter  to stand for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. He made numerous contributions to the study of topology, graph theory, calculus, combinatorics, and complex analysis, as evidenced by the multitude of theorems and notations named for him.\n\nOther important European mathematicians of the 18th century included Joseph Louis Lagrange, who did pioneering work in number theory, algebra, differential calculus, and the calculus of variations, and Laplace who, in the age of Napoleon, did important work on the foundations of celestial mechanics and on statistics.\n\n Modern \n\n 19th century \n\nthumb|right|upright|Carl Friedrich Gauss.\nThroughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on functions of complex variables, in geometry, and on the convergence of series, leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra and of the quadratic reciprocity law.\n\nthumb|left|upright=1.5|Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry\nThis century saw the development of the two forms of non-Euclidean geometry, where the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry no longer holds.\nThe Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician J\u00e1nos Bolyai, independently defined and studied hyperbolic geometry, where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180\u00b0. Elliptic geometry was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180\u00b0. Riemann also developed Riemannian geometry, which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined the concept of a manifold, which generalizes the ideas of curves and surfaces.\n\nThe 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of abstract algebra. Hermann Grassmann in Germany gave a first version of vector spaces, William Rowan Hamilton in Ireland developed noncommutative algebra. The British mathematician George Boole devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called Boolean algebra, in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in computer science.\n\nAugustin-Louis Cauchy, Bernhard Riemann, and Karl Weierstrass reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. Niels Henrik Abel, a Norwegian, and \u00c9variste Galois, a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four (Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to trisect an arbitrary angle, to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three dimensions in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of parameter space and hypercomplex numbers.\n\nAbel and Galois's investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid the groundwork for further developments of group theory, and the associated fields of abstract algebra. In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group theory as the ideal way to study symmetry.\n\nIn the later 19th century, Georg Cantor established the first foundations of set theory, which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of mathematical logic in the hands of Peano, L.E.J. Brouwer, David Hilbert, Bertrand Russell, and A.N. Whitehead, initiated a long running debate on the foundations of mathematics.\n\nThe 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the London Mathematical Society in 1865, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France in 1872, the Circolo Matematico di Palermo in 1884, the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in 1883, and the American Mathematical Society in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the Quaternion Society, was formed in 1899, in the context of a vector controversy.\n\nIn 1897, Hensel introduced p-adic numbers.\n\n 20th century  \nThe 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. An effort to catalogue the areas and applications of mathematics was undertaken in Klein's encyclopedia.\n\nIn a 1900 speech to the International Congress of Mathematicians, David Hilbert set out a list of 23 unsolved problems in mathematics. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.\n\nthumb|left|upright|A map illustrating the Four Color Theorem\nNotable historical conjectures were finally proven. In 1976, Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel proved the four color theorem, controversial at the time for the use of a computer to do so. Andrew Wiles, building on the work of others, proved Fermat's Last Theorem in 1995. Paul Cohen and Kurt G\u00f6del proved that the continuum hypothesis is independent of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the standard axioms of set theory. In 1998 Thomas Callister Hales proved the Kepler conjecture.\n\nMathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the classification of finite simple groups (also called the \"enormous theorem\"), whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, including Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9 Weil, publishing under the pseudonym \"Nicolas Bourbaki\", attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education.Maurice Mashaal, 2006. Bourbaki: A Secret Society of Mathematicians. American Mathematical Society. .\n\nthumb|Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star, with relativistic precession of apsides\nDifferential geometry came into its own when Einstein used it in general relativity. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as mathematical logic, topology, and John von Neumann's game theory changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of structures were abstracted using axioms and given names like metric spaces, topological spaces etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to category theory. Grothendieck and Serre recast algebraic geometry using sheaf theory. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of dynamical systems that Poincar\u00e9 had begun in the 1890s.\nMeasure theory was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the Lebesgue integral, Kolmogorov's axiomatisation of probability theory, and ergodic theory. Knot theory greatly expanded. Quantum mechanics led to the development of functional analysis. Other new areas include Laurent Schwartz's distribution theory, fixed point theory, singularity theory and Ren\u00e9 Thom's catastrophe theory, model theory, and Mandelbrot's fractals. Lie theory with its Lie groups and Lie algebras became one of the major areas of study.\n\nNon-standard analysis, introduced by Abraham Robinson, rehabilitated the infinitesimal approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of limits, by extending the field of real numbers to the Hyperreal numbers which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the surreal numbers were discovered by John Horton Conway in connection with combinatorial games.\n\nThe development and continual improvement of computers, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed industry to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: Alan Turing's computability theory; complexity theory; Derrick Henry Lehmer's use of ENIAC to further number theory and the Lucas-Lehmer test; R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter's recursive function theory; Claude Shannon's information theory; signal processing; data analysis; optimization and other areas of operations research. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on calculus and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of discrete concepts and the expansion of combinatorics including graph theory. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as numerical analysis and symbolic computation. Some of the most important methods and algorithms of the 20th century are: the simplex algorithm, the Fast Fourier Transform, error-correcting codes, the Kalman filter from control theory and the RSA algorithm of public-key cryptography.\n\nAt the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the natural numbers plus one of addition and multiplication, was decidable, i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, Kurt G\u00f6del found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as Peano arithmetic, was in fact incompletable. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of number theory, including the notion of prime number.) A consequence of G\u00f6del's two incompleteness theorems is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of analysis and geometry), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that cannot be proved within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and David Hilbert's dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.\n\nthumb|right|The absolute value of the Gamma function on the complex plane.\nOne of the more colorful figures in 20th-century mathematics was Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan (1887\u20131920), an Indian autodidact who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of highly composite numbers, the partition function and its asymptotics, and mock theta functions. He also made major investigations in the areas of gamma functions, modular forms, divergent series, hypergeometric series and prime number theory.\n\nPaul Erd\u0151s published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to the Kevin Bacon Game, which leads to the Erd\u0151s number of a mathematician. This describes the \"collaborative distance\" between a person and Paul Erd\u0151s, as measured by joint authorship of mathematical papers.\n\nEmmy Noether has been described by many as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.. She studied the theories of rings, fields, and algebras.\n\nAs in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the Mathematics Subject Classification was dozens of pages long.Mathematics Subject Classification 2000 More and more mathematical journals were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the World Wide Web led to online publishing.\n\n 21st century \n\nIn 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute announced the seven Millennium Prize Problems, and in 2003 the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture was solved by Grigori Perelman (who declined to accept an award, as he was critical of the mathematics establishment).\n\nMost mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many online-only journals are launched. There is an increasing drive towards open access publishing, first popularized by the arXiv.\n\n Future \n\nThere are many observable trends in mathematics, the most notable being that the subject is growing ever larger, computers are ever more important and powerful, the application of mathematics to bioinformatics is rapidly expanding, and the volume of data being produced by science and industry, facilitated by computers, is explosively expanding.\n\nSee also\n\n History of algebra\n History of calculus\n History of combinatorics\n History of the function concept\n History of geometry\n History of logic\n History of mathematical notation\n History of numbers\n History of number theory\n History of statistics\n History of trigonometry\n History of writing numbers\n Kenneth O.

{"title": "History of the function concept", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_function_concept", "text": "The mathematical concept of a function emerged in the 17th century in connection with the development of the calculus; for example, the slope  of a graph at a point was regarded as a function of the x-coordinate of the point. Functions were not explicitly considered in antiquity, but some precursors of the concept can perhaps be seen in the work of medieval philosophers and mathematicians such as Oresme.\n\nMathematicians of the 18th century typically regarded a function as being defined by an analytic expression. In the 19th century, the demands of the rigorous development of analysis by Weierstrass and others, the reformulation of geometry in terms of analysis, and the invention of set theory by Cantor, eventually led to the much more general modern concept of a function as a single-valued mapping from one set to another.\n\nFunctions before the 17th century\n\nAlready in the 12th century, mathematician Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi analyzed the equation  in the form  stating that the left hand side must at least equal the value of  for the equation to have a solution. He then determined the maximum value of this expression. It is arguable that the isolation of this expression is an early approach to the notion of a \"function\". A value less than  means no positive solution; a value equal to  corresponds to one solution, while a value greater than  corresponds to two solutions. Sharaf al-Din's analysis of this equation was a notable development in Islamic mathematics, but his work was not pursued any further at that time, neither in the Muslim world nor in Europe.\n\nAccording to Dieudonn\u00e9  and Ponte,\"The emergence of a notion of function as an individualized mathematical entity can be traced to the beginnings of infinitesimal calculus\". () the concept of a function emerged in the 17th century as a result of the development of analytic geometry and the infinitesimal calculus. Nevertheless, Medvedev suggests that the implicit concept of a function is one with an ancient lineage.\"...although we do not find in [the mathematicians of Ancient Greece] the idea of functional dependence distinguished in explicit form as a comparatively independent object of study, nevertheless one cannot help noticing the large stock of functional correspondences they studied.\" () Ponte also sees more explicit approaches to the concept in the Middle Ages:\n\nHistorically, some mathematicians can be regarded as having foreseen and come close to a modern formulation of the concept of function. Among them is Oresme (1323\u20131382) . . . In his theory, some general ideas about independent and dependent variable quantities seem to be present.\n\nThe development of analytical geometry around 1640 allowed mathematicians to go between geometric problems about curves and algebraic relations between \"variable coordinates x and y.\" Calculus was developed using the notion of variables, with their associated geometric meaning, which persisted well into the eighteenth century. However, the terminology of \"function\" came to be used in interactions between Leibniz and Bernoulli towards the end of the 17th century.\n\nThe notion of \"function\" in analysis\n\nThe term \"function\" was literally introduced by Gottfried Leibniz, in a 1673 letter, to describe a quantity related to points of a curve, such as a coordinate or curve's slope.Eves dates Leibniz's first use to the year 1694 and also similarly relates the usage to \"as a term to denote any quantity connected with a curve, such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the slope of the curve, and so on\" ().\nJohann Bernoulli started calling expressions made of a single variable \"functions.\"\nIn 1698, he agreed with Leibniz that any quantity formed \"in an algebraic and transcendental manner\" may be called a function of x.\nBy 1718, he came to regard as a function \"any expression made up of a variable and some constants.\" Alexis Claude Clairaut (in approximately 1734) and Leonhard Euler introduced the familiar notation  for the value of a function.\n\nThe functions considered in those times are called today differentiable functions. For this type of function, one can talk about limits and derivatives; both are measurements of the output or the change in the output as it depends on the input or the change in the input.  Such functions are the basis of calculus.\n\nEuler\nIn the first volume of his fundamental text Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum, published in 1748, Euler gave essentially the same definition of a function as his teacher Bernoulli, as an expression or formula involving variables and constants e.g., . Euler's own definition reads:\n\nA function of a variable quantity is an analytic expression composed in any way whatsoever of the variable quantity and numbers or constant quantities.\n\nEuler also allowed multi-valued functions whose values are determined by an implicit equation.\n\nIn 1755, however, in his Institutiones Calculi Differentialis, Euler gave a more general concept of a function:\n\nWhen certain quantities depend on others in such a way that they undergo a change when the latter change, then the first are called functions of the second. This name has an extremely broad character; it encompasses all the ways in which one quantity can be determined in terms of others.\n\nMedvedev considers that \"In essence this is the definition that became known as Dirichlet's definition.\" Edwards also credits Euler with a general concept of a function and says further that\n\nThe relations among these quantities are not thought of as being given by formulas, but on the other hand they are surely not thought of as being the sort of general set-theoretic, anything-goes subsets of product spaces that modern mathematicians mean when they use the word \"function\".\n\nFourier\nIn his Th\u00e9orie Analytique de la Chaleur, Fourier claimed that an arbitrary function could be represented by a Fourier series.Contemporary mathematicians, with much broader and more precise conceptions of functions, integration, and different notions of convergence than was possible in Fourier's time (including examples of functions that were regarded as pathological and referred to as \"monsters\" until as late as the turn of the 20th century), would not agree with Fourier that a completely arbitrary function can be expanded in Fourier series, even if its Fourier coefficients are well-defined. For example, Kolmogorov (1922) constructed a Lebesgue integrable function whose Fourier series diverges pointwise almost everywhere. Nevertheless, a very wide class of functions can be expanded in Fourier series, especially if one allows weaker forms of convergence, such as convergence in the sense of distributions. Thus, Fourier's claim was a reasonable one in the context of his time. Fourier had a general conception of a function, which included functions that were neither continuous nor defined by an analytical expression.For example: \"A general function f(x) is a sequence of values or ordinates, each of which is arbitrary...It is by no means assumed that these ordinates are subject to any general law; they may follow one another in a completely arbitrary manner, and each of them is defined as if it were a unique quantity.\" () Related questions on the nature and representation of functions, arising from the solution of the wave equation for a vibrating string, had already been the subject of dispute between d'Alembert and Euler, and they had a significant impact in generalizing the notion of a function. Luzin observes that:\n\nThe modern understanding of function and its definition, which seems correct to us, could arise only after Fourier's discovery. His discovery showed clearly that most of the misunderstandings that arose in the debate about the vibrating string were the result of confusing two seemingly identical but actually vastly different concepts, namely that of function and that of its analytic representation. Indeed, prior to Fourier's discovery no distinction was drawn between the concepts of \"function\" and of \"analytic representation,\" and it was this discovery that brought about their disconnection.. Translation by Abe Shenitzer of an article by Luzin that appeared (in the 1930s) in the first edition of The Great Soviet Encyclopedia\n\nCauchy\nDuring the 19th century, mathematicians started to formalize all the different branches of mathematics. One of the first to do so was Cauchy; his somewhat imprecise results were later made completely rigorous by Weierstrass, who advocated building calculus on arithmetic rather than on geometry, which favoured Euler's definition over Leibniz's (see arithmetization of analysis). According to Smithies, Cauchy thought of functions as being defined by equations involving real or complex numbers, and tacitly assumed they were continuous:\n\nCauchy makes some general remarks about functions in Chapter I, Section 1 of his Analyse alg\u00e9brique (1821). From what he says there, it is clear that he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors is that he is prepared to consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.\n\nLobachevsky and Dirichlet\nNikolai Lobachevsky\"On the vanishing of trigonometric series,\" 1834 (). and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet\u00dcber die Darstellung ganz willk\u00fcrlicher Funktionen durch Sinus- und Cosinusreihen,\" 1837 (). are traditionally credited with independently giving the modern \"formal\" definition of a function as a relation in which every first element has a unique second element.\n\nLobachevsky (1834) writes that\n\nThe general concept of a function requires that a function of x be defined as a number given for each x and varying gradually with x. The value of the function can be given either by an analytic expression, or by a condition that provides a means of examining all numbers and choosing one of them; or finally the dependence may exist but remain unknown. as quoted in .\n\nwhile Dirichlet (1837) writes\n\nIf now a unique finite y corresponding to each x, and moreover in such a way that when x ranges continuously over the interval from a to b,  also varies continuously, then y is called a continuous function of x for this interval. It is not at all necessary here that y be given in terms of x by one and the same law throughout the entire interval, and it is not necessary that it be regarded as a dependence expressed using mathematical operations. as quoted in .\n\nEves asserts that \"the student of mathematics usually meets the Dirichlet definition of function in his introductory course in calculus,.Eves asserts that Dirichlet \"arrived at the following formulation: \"[The notion of] a variable is a symbol that represents any one of a set of numbers; if two variables x and y are so related that whenever a value is assigned to x there is automatically assigned, by some rule or correspondence, a value to y, then we say y is a (single-valued) function of x. The variable x . . . is called the independent variable and the variable y is called the dependent variable. The permissible values that x may assume constitute the domain of definition of the function, and the values taken on by y constitute the range of values of the function . . . it stresses the basic idea of a relationship between two sets of numbers\" \n\nDirichlet's claim to this formalization has been disputed by Imre Lakatos:\n\nThere is no such definition in Dirichlet's works at all.  But there is ample evidence that he had no idea of this concept.  In his [1837] paper for instance, when he discusses piecewise continuous functions, he says that at points of discontinuity the function has two values: ... Published posthumously.\n\nHowever, Gardiner says\n\"...it seems to me that Lakatos goes too far, for example, when he asserts that 'there is ample evidence that [Dirichlet] had no idea of [the modern function] concept'.\"\nMoreover, as noted above, Dirichlet's paper does appear to include a definition along the lines of what is usually ascribed to him, even though (like Lobachevsky) he states it only for continuous functions of a real variable.\n\nSimilarly, Lavine observes that:\n\nIt is a matter of some dispute how much credit Dirichlet deserves for the modern definition of a function, in part because he restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of continuous function to make it clear that no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general. This would have deserved special emphasis because of Euler's definition of a continuous function as one given by single expression-or law. But I also doubt there is sufficient evidence to settle the dispute.\n\nBecause Lobachevsky and Dirichlet have been credited as among the first to introduce the notion of an arbitrary correspondence, this notion is sometimes referred to as the Dirichlet or Lobachevsky-Dirichlet definition of a function.See  for further discussion. A general version of this definition was later used by Bourbaki (1939), and some in the education community refer to it as the \"Dirichlet\u2013Bourbaki\" definition of a function.\n\nDedekind\nDieudonn\u00e9, who was one of the founding members of the Bourbaki group, credits a precise and general modern definition of a function to Dedekind in his work\nWas sind und was sollen die Zahlen,\"By a mapping \u03c6 of a set S we understand a law that assigns to each element s of S a uniquely determined object called the image of s, denoted as \u03c6(s).  which appeared in 1888 but had already been drafted in 1878. Dieudonn\u00e9 observes that instead of confining himself, as in previous conceptions, to real (or complex) functions, Dedekind defines a function as a single-valued mapping between any two sets:\n\nWhat was new and what was to be essential for the whole of mathematics was the entirely general conception of a function.\n\nHardy\n defined a function as a relation between two variables x and y such that \"to some values of x at any rate correspond values of y.\"  He neither required the function to be defined for all values of x nor to associate each value of x to a single value of\u00a0y. This broad definition of a function encompasses more relations than are ordinarily considered functions in contemporary mathematics.  For example, Hardy's definition includes multivalued functions and what in computability theory are called partial functions.\n\nThe logician's \"function\" prior to 1850\nLogicians of this time were primarily involved with analyzing syllogisms (the 2000-year-old Aristotelian forms and otherwise), or as Augustus De Morgan (1847) stated it: \"the examination of that part of reasoning which depends upon the manner in which inferences are formed,\nand the investigation of general maxims and rules for constructing arguments\". At this time the notion of (logical) \"function\" is not explicit, but at least in the work of De Morgan and George Boole it is implied: we see abstraction of the argument forms, the introduction of variables, the introduction of a symbolic algebra with respect to these variables, and some of the notions of set theory.\n\nDe Morgan's 1847 \"FORMAL LOGIC OR, The Calculus of Inference, Necessary and Probable\" observes that \"[a] logical truth depends upon the structure of the statement, and not upon the particular matters spoken of\"; he wastes no time (preface page i) abstracting: \"In the form of the proposition, the copula is made as abstract as the terms\". He immediately (p.\u00a01) casts what he calls \"the proposition\" (present-day propositional function or relation) into a form such as \"X is Y\", where the symbols X, \"is\", and Y represent, respectively, the subject, copula, and predicate. While the word \"function\" does not appear, the notion of \"abstraction\" is there, \"variables\" are there, the notion of inclusion in his symbolism \"all of the \u0394 is in the \u041e\" (p.\u00a09) is there, and lastly a new symbolism for logical analysis of the notion of \"relation\" (he uses the word with respect to this example \" X)Y \" (p.\u00a075) ) is there:\n\" A1 X)Y  To take an X it is necessary to take a Y\" [or To be an X it is necessary to be a Y]\n\" A1 Y)X  To take a Y it is sufficient to take a X\" [or To be a Y it is sufficient to be an X], etc.\n\nIn his 1848 The Nature of Logic Boole asserts that \"logic  . . . is in a more especial sense the science of reasoning by signs\", and he briefly discusses the notions of \"belonging to\" and \"class\": \"An individual may possess a great variety of attributes and thus belonging to a great variety of different classes\" .Boole 1848 in  Like De Morgan he uses the notion of \"variable\" drawn from analysis; he gives an example of \"represent[ing] the class oxen by x and that of horses by y and the conjunction and by the sign + . . . we might represent the aggregate class oxen and horses by x + y\".Boole 1848 in \n\nIn the context of \"the Differential Calculus\" Boole defined (circa 1849) the notion of a function as follows:\n\"That quantity whose variation is uniform . . . is called the independent variable. That quantity whose variation is referred to the variation of the former is said to be a function of it. The Differential calculus enables us in every case to pass from the function to the limit. This it does by a certain Operation. But in the very Idea of an Operation is . . . the idea of an inverse operation. To effect that inverse operation in the present instance is the business of the Int[egral] Calculus.\"Boole circa 1849 Elementary Treatise on Logic not mathematical including philosophy of mathematical reasoning in \n\nThe logicians' \"function\" 1850\u20131950\nEves observes \"that logicians have endeavored to push down further the starting level of the definitional development of mathematics and to derive the theory of sets, or classes, from a foundation in the logic of propositions and propositional functions\". But by the late 19th century the logicians' research into the foundations of mathematics was undergoing a major split. The direction of the first group, the Logicists, can probably be summed up best by  \u2013 \"to fulfil two objects, first, to show that all mathematics follows from symbolic logic, and secondly to discover, as far as possible, what are the principles of symbolic logic itself.\"\n\nThe second group of logicians, the set-theorists, emerged with Georg Cantor's \"set theory\" (1870\u20131890) but were driven forward partly as a result of Russell's discovery of a paradox that could be derived from Frege's conception of \"function\", but also as a reaction against Russell's proposed solution.Some of this criticism is intense: see the introduction by Willard Quine preceding  Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types in . See also in  the introduction to his Axiomatization of Set Theory in  Zermelo's set-theoretic response was his 1908 Investigations in the foundations of set theory I \u2013 the first axiomatic set theory; here too the notion of \"propositional function\" plays a role.\n\nGeorge Boole's The Laws of Thought 1854; John Venn's Symbolic Logic 1881\nIn his An Investigation into the laws of thought Boole now defined a function in terms of a symbol x as follows:\n\"8. Definition. \u2013 Any algebraic expression involving symbol x is termed a function of x, and may be represented by the abbreviated form f(x)\"\nBoole then used algebraic expressions to define both algebraic and logical notions, e.g., 1\u2212x is logical NOT(x), xy is the logical AND(x,y), x + y is the logical OR(x, y), x(x+y) is xx+xy, and \"the special law\" xx = x2 = x.cf . Boole discusses this \"special law\" with its two algebraic roots x = 0 or 1, on page 37.\n\nIn his 1881 Symbolic Logic Venn was using the words \"logical function\" and the contemporary symbolism ( x = f(y), y = f\u22121(x), cf page xxi) plus the circle-diagrams historically associated with Venn to describe \"class relations\",Although he gives others credit, cf  the notions \"'quantifying' our predicate\", \"propositions in respect of their extension\", \"the relation of inclusion and exclusion of two classes to one another\", and \"propositional function\" (all on p.\u00a010), the bar over a variable to indicate not-x (page 43), etc. Indeed he equated unequivocally the notion of \"logical function\" with \"class\" [modern \"set\"]: \"... on the view adopted in this book, f(x) never stands for anything but a logical class. It may be a compound class aggregated of many simple classes; it may be a class indicated by certain inverse logical operations, it may be composed of two groups of classes equal to one another, or what is the same thing, their difference declared equal to zero, that is, a logical equation. But however composed or derived, f(x) with us will never be anything else than a general expression for such logical classes of things as may fairly find a place in ordinary Logic\".\n\nFrege's Begriffsschrift 1879\nGottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift (1879) preceded Giuseppe Peano (1889), but Peano had no knowledge of  until after he had published his 1889.cf van Heijenoort's introduction to  in . For most of his logical symbolism and notions of propositions Peano credits \"many writers, especially Boole\". In footnote 1 he credits Boole 1847, 1848, 1854, Schr\u00f6der 1877, Peirce 1880, Jevons 1883, MacColl 1877, 1878, 1878a, 1880; cf ). Both writers strongly influenced . Russell in turn influenced much of 20th-century mathematics and logic through his Principia Mathematica (1913) jointly authored with Alfred North Whitehead.\n\nAt the outset Frege abandons the traditional \"concepts subject and predicate\", replacing them with argument and function respectively, which he believes \"will stand the test of time. It is easy to see how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of the connection between the meanings of the words if, and, not, or, there is, some, all, and so forth, deserves attention\". in \n\nFrege begins his discussion of \"function\" with an example: Begin with the expressionFrege's exact words are \"expressed in our formula language\" and \"expression\", cf  in . \"Hydrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide\". Now remove the sign for hydrogen (i.e., the word \"hydrogen\") and replace it with the sign for oxygen (i.e., the word \"oxygen\"); this makes a second statement. Do this again (using either statement) and substitute the sign for nitrogen (i.e., the word \"nitrogen\") and note that \"This changes the meaning in such a way that \"oxygen\" or \"nitrogen\" enters into the relations in which \"hydrogen\" stood before\".This example is from  in  There are three statements:\n \"Hydrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide.\"\n \"Oxygen is lighter than carbon dioxide.\"\n \"Nitrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide.\"\nNow observe in all three a \"stable component, representing the totality of [the] relations\"; in  call this the function, i.e.,\n \"... is lighter than carbon dioxide\", is the function.\nFrege calls the argument of the function \"[t]he sign [e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen], regarded as replaceable by others that denotes the object standing in these relations\".Frege cautions that the function will have \"argument places\" where the argument should be placed as distinct from other places where the same sign might appear. But he does not go deeper into how to signify these positions and  observes this. He notes that we could have derived the function as \"Hydrogen is lighter than . . ..\" as well, with an argument position on the right; the exact observation is made by Peano (see more below). Finally, Frege allows for the case of two (or more arguments). For example, remove \"carbon dioxide\" to yield the invariant part (the function) as:\n \"... is lighter than ... \"\nThe one-argument function Frege generalizes into the form \u03a6(A) where A is the argument and \u03a6( ) represents the function, whereas the two-argument function he symbolizes as \u03a8(A, B) with A and B the arguments and \u03a8( , ) the function and cautions that \"in general \u03a8(A, B) differs from \u03a8(B, A)\". Using his unique symbolism he translates for the reader the following symbolism:\n\"We can read |--- \u03a6(A) as \"A has the property \u03a6. |--- \u03a8(A, B) can be translated by \"B stands in the relation \u03a8 to A\" or \"B is a result of an application of the procedure \u03a8 to the object A\". in \n\nPeano's The Principles of Arithmetic 1889\nPeano defined the notion of \"function\" in a manner somewhat similar to Frege, but without the precision.\"...Peano intends to cover much more ground than Frege does in his Begriffsschrift and his subsequent works, but he does not till that ground to any depth comparable to what Frege does in his self-allotted field\",  First Peano defines the sign \"K means class, or aggregate of objects\", the objects of which satisfy three simple equality-conditions, a = a, (a = b) = (b = a), IF ((a = b) AND (b = c)) THEN (a = c). He then introduces \u03c6, \"a sign or an aggregate of signs such that if x is an object of the class s, the expression \u03c6x denotes a new object\". Peano adds two conditions on these new objects: First, that the three equality-conditions hold for the objects \u03c6x; secondly, that \"if x and y are objects of class s and if x = y, we assume it is possible to deduce \u03c6x = \u03c6y\".All symbols used here are from  in ). Given all these conditions are met, \u03c6 is a \"function presign\". Likewise he identifies a \"function postsign\". For example   if \u03c6 is the function presign a+, then \u03c6x yields a+x, or if \u03c6 is the function postsign +a then x\u03c6 yields  x+a.\n\nBertrand Russell's The Principles of Mathematics 1903\nWhile the influence of Cantor and Peano was paramount,\"In Mathematics, my chief obligations, as is indeed evident, are to Georg Cantor and Professor Peano. If I had become acquainted sooner with the work of Professor Frege, I should have owed a great deal to him, but as it is I arrived independently at many results which he had already established\", . He also highlights Boole's 1854 Laws of Thought and Ernst Schr\u00f6der's three volumes of \"non-Peanesque methods\" 1890, 1891, and 1895 cf  in Appendix A \"The Logical and Arithmetical Doctrines of Frege\" of The Principles of Mathematics, Russell arrives at a discussion of Frege's notion of function, \"...a point in which Frege's work is very important, and requires careful examination\". In response to his 1902 exchange of letters with Frege about the contradiction he discovered in Frege's Begriffsschrift Russell tacked this section on at the last moment.\n\nFor Russell the bedeviling notion is that of \"variable\": \"6. Mathematical propositions are not only characterized by the fact that they assert implications, but also by the fact that they contain variables. The notion of the variable is one of the most difficult with which logic has to deal. For the present, I openly wish to make it plain that there are variables in all mathematical propositions, even where at first sight they might seem to be absent. . . . We shall find always, in all mathematical propositions, that the words any or some occur; and these words are the marks of a variable and a formal implication\".\n\nAs expressed by Russell \"the process of transforming constants in a proposition into variables leads to what is called generalization, and gives us, as it were, the formal essence of a proposition ... So long as any term in our proposition can be turned into a variable, our proposition can be generalized; and so long as this is possible, it is the business of mathematics to do it\"; these generalizations Russell named propositional functions\". Indeed he cites and quotes from Frege's Begriffsschrift and presents a vivid example from Frege's 1891 Function und Begriff: That \"the essence of the arithmetical function 2x3\u00a0+\u00a0x is what is left when the x is taken away, i.e., in the above instance 2(\u00a0)3\u00a0+\u00a0(\u00a0). The argument x does not belong to the function but the two taken together make the whole\". Russell agreed with Frege's notion of \"function\" in one sense: \"He regards functions \u2013 and in this I agree with him \u2013 as more fundamental than predicates and relations\" but Russell rejected Frege's \"theory of subject and assertion\", in particular \"he thinks that, if a term a occurs in a proposition, the proposition can always be analysed into a and an assertion about a\".\n\nEvolution of Russell's notion of \"function\" 1908\u20131913\nRussell would carry his ideas forward in his 1908 Mathematical logical as based on the theory of types and into his and Whitehead's 1910\u20131913 Principia Mathematica. By the time of Principia Mathematica Russell, like Frege, considered the propositional function fundamental: \"Propositional functions are the fundamental kind from which the more usual kinds of function, such as \"sin x\" or log x or \"the father of x\" are derived. These derivative functions . . . are called \"descriptive functions\". The functions of propositions . . . are a particular case of propositional functions\".Russell 1910\u20131913:15\n\nPropositional functions: Because his terminology is different from the contemporary, the reader may be confused by Russell's \"propositional function\". An example may help. Russell writes a propositional function in its raw form, e.g., as \u03c6\u0177: \"\u0177 is hurt\". (Observe the circumflex or \"hat\" over the variable y). For our example, we will assign just 4 values to the variable \u0177: \"Bob\", \"This bird\", \"Emily the rabbit\", and \"y\". Substitution of one of these values for variable \u0177 yields a proposition; this proposition is called a \"value\" of the propositional function. In our example there are four values of the propositional function, e.g., \"Bob is hurt\", \"This bird is hurt\", \"Emily the rabbit is hurt\" and \"y is hurt.\" A proposition, if it is significant\u2014i.e., if its truth is determinate\u2014has a truth-value of truth or falsity. If a proposition's truth value is \"truth\" then the variable's value is said to satisfy the propositional function. Finally, per Russell's definition, \"a class [set] is all objects satisfying some propositional function\" (p.\u00a023). Note the word \"all'\" \u2013 this is how the contemporary notions of \"For all \u2200\" and \"there exists at least one instance \u2203\" enter the treatment (p.\u00a015).\n\nTo continue the example: Suppose (from outside the mathematics/logic) one determines that the propositions \"Bob is hurt\" has a truth value of \"falsity\", \"This bird is hurt\" has a truth value of \"truth\", \"Emily the rabbit is hurt\" has an indeterminate truth value because \"Emily the rabbit\" doesn't exist, and \"y is hurt\" is ambiguous as to its truth value because the argument y itself is ambiguous. While the two propositions \"Bob is hurt\" and \"This bird is hurt\" are significant (both have truth values), only the value \"This bird\" of the variable \u0177 satisfies the propositional function \u03c6\u0177: \"\u0177 is hurt\". When one goes to form the class \u03b1: \u03c6\u0177: \"\u0177 is hurt\", only \"This bird\" is included, given the four values \"Bob\", \"This bird\", \"Emily the rabbit\" and \"y\" for variable \u0177 and their respective truth-values: falsity, truth, indeterminate, ambiguous.\n\nRussell defines functions of propositions with arguments, and truth-functions f(p).Whitehead and Russell 1910\u20131913:6, 8 respectively For example, suppose one were to form the \"function of propositions with arguments\" p1: \"NOT(p) AND q\" and assign its variables the values of p: \"Bob is hurt\" and q: \"This bird is hurt\". (We are restricted to  the logical linkages NOT, AND, OR and IMPLIES, and we can only assign \"significant\" propositions to the variables p and q). Then the \"function of propositions with arguments\" is p1: NOT(\"Bob is hurt\") AND \"This bird is hurt\". To determine the truth value of this \"function of propositions with arguments\" we submit it to a \"truth function\", e.g., f(p1): f( NOT(\"Bob is hurt\") AND \"This bird is hurt\" ), which yields a truth value of \"truth\".\n\nThe notion of a \"many-one\" functional relation\": Russell first discusses the notion of \"identity\", then defines a descriptive function (pages 30ff) as the unique value \u03b9x that satisfies the (2-variable) propositional function (i.e., \"relation\") \u03c6\u0177.\nN.B. The reader should be warned here that the order of the variables are reversed! y is the independent variable and x is the dependent variable, e.g., x = sin(y).Something similar appears in . Tarski refers to a \"relational function\" as a \"ONE-MANY [sic!] or FUNCTIONAL RELATION or simply a FUNCTION\". Tarski comments about this reversal of variables on page 99.\nRussell symbolizes the descriptive function as \"the object standing in relation to y\": R'y =DEF (\u03b9x)(x R y). Russell repeats that \"R'y is a function of y, but not a propositional function [sic]; we shall call it a descriptive function. All the ordinary functions of mathematics are of this kind. Thus in our notation \"sin y\" would be written \" sin  'y \", and \"sin\" would stand for the relation sin  'y has to y\".Whitehead and Russell 1910\u20131913:31. This paper is important enough that van Heijenoort reprinted it as  Incomplete symbols: Descriptions with commentary by W. V. Quine in \n\nThe formalist's \"function\": David Hilbert's axiomatization of mathematics (1904\u20131927)\nDavid Hilbert set himself the goal of \"formalizing\" classical mathematics \"as a formal axiomatic theory, and this theory shall be proved to be consistent, i.e., free from contradiction\". In  The Foundations of Mathematics he frames the notion of function in terms of the existence of an \"object\":\n 13. A(a) --> A(\u03b5(A)) Here \u03b5(A) stands for an object of which the proposition A(a) certainly holds if it holds of any object at all; let us call \u03b5 the logical \u03b5-function\".Hilbert in  [The arrow indicates \"implies\".]\nHilbert then illustrates the three ways how the \u03b5-function is to be used, firstly as the \"for all\" and \"there exists\" notions, secondly to represent the \"object of which [a proposition] holds\", and lastly how to cast it into the choice function.\n\nRecursion theory and computability: But the unexpected outcome of Hilbert's and his student Bernays's effort was failure; see G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems of 1931. At about the same time, in an effort to solve Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem, mathematicians set about to define what was meant by an \"effectively calculable function\" (Alonzo Church 1936), i.e., \"effective method\" or \"algorithm\", that is, an explicit, step-by-step procedure that would succeed in computing a function. Various models for algorithms appeared, in rapid succession, including Church's lambda calculus (1936), Stephen Kleene's \u03bc-recursive functions(1936) and Alan Turing's (1936\u20137) notion of replacing human \"computers\" with utterly-mechanical \"computing machines\" (see Turing machines).  It was shown that all of these models could compute the same class of computable functions. Church's thesis holds that this class of functions exhausts all the number-theoretic functions that can be calculated by an algorithm. The outcomes of these efforts were vivid demonstrations that, in Turing's words, \"there can be no general process for determining whether a given formula U of the functional calculus K [Principia Mathematica] is provable\";Turing 1936\u20137 in  see more at Independence (mathematical logic) and Computability theory.\n\nDevelopment of the set-theoretic definition of \"function\"\nSet theory began with the work of the logicians with the notion of \"class\" (modern \"set\") for example , Jevons (1880), ,  and . It was given a push by Georg Cantor's attempt to define the infinite in set-theoretic treatment (1870\u20131890) and a subsequent discovery of an antinomy (contradiction, paradox) in this treatment (Cantor's paradox), by Russell's discovery (1902) of an antinomy in Frege's 1879 (Russell's paradox), by the discovery of more antinomies in the early 20th century (e.g., the 1897 Burali-Forti paradox and the 1905 Richard paradox), and by resistance to Russell's complex treatment of logic and dislike of his axiom of reducibility\"The nonprimitive and arbitrary character of this axiom drew forth severe criticism, and much of subsequent refinement of the logistic program lies in attempts to devise some method of avoiding the disliked axiom of reducibility\" . (1908, 1910\u20131913) that he proposed as a means to evade the antinomies.\n\nRussell's paradox 1902\nIn 1902 Russell sent a letter to Frege pointing out that Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift allowed a function to be an argument of itself: \"On the other hand, it may also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate . . ..\" in  From this unconstrained situation Russell was able to form a paradox:\n\"You state ... that a function, too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let w be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can w be predicated of itself?\" Letter to Frege in \nFrege responded promptly that \"Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic\". Letter to Russell in \n\nFrom this point forward development of the foundations of mathematics became an exercise in how to dodge \"Russell's paradox\", framed as it was in \"the bare [set-theoretic] notions of set and element\".van Heijenoort's commentary to Russell's Letter to Frege in \n\nZermelo's set theory (1908) modified by Skolem (1922)\nThe notion of \"function\" appears as Zermelo's axiom III\u2014the Axiom of Separation (Axiom der Aussonderung). This axiom constrains us to use a propositional function \u03a6(x) to \"separate\" a subset M\u03a6 from a previously formed set M:\n \"AXIOM III. (Axiom of separation). Whenever the propositional function \u03a6(x) is definite for all elements of a set M, M possesses a subset M\u03a6 containing as elements precisely those elements x of M for which \u03a6(x) is true\".The original uses an Old High German symbol in place of \u03a6 cf  in \n\nAs there is no universal set\u2014sets originate by way of Axiom II from elements of (non-set) domain B \u2013 \"...this disposes of the Russell antinomy so far as we are concerned\". in  But Zermelo's \"definite criterion\" is imprecise, and is fixed by Weyl, Fraenkel, Skolem, and von Neumann.cf van Heijenoort's commentary before Zermelo 1908 Investigations in the foundations of set theory I in \n\nIn fact Skolem in his 1922 referred to this \"definite criterion\" or \"property\" as a \"definite proposition\":\n\"... a finite expression constructed from elementary propositions of the form a \u03b5 b or a = b by means of the five operations [logical conjunction, disjunction, negation, universal quantification, and existential quantification]. in \n\nvan Heijenoort summarizes:\n\"A property is definite in Skolem's sense if it is expressed . . . by a well-formed formula in the simple predicate calculus of first order in which the sole predicate constants are \u03b5 and possibly, =. ... Today an axiomatization of set theory is usually embedded in a logical calculus, and it is Weyl's and Skolem's approach to the formulation of the axiom of separation that is generally adopted.van Heijenoort's introduction to Abraham Fraenkel's The notion \"definite\" and the independence of the axiom of choice in .\n\nIn this quote the reader may observe a shift in terminology: nowhere is mentioned the notion of \"propositional function\", but rather one sees the words \"formula\", \"predicate calculus\", \"predicate\", and \"logical calculus.\" This shift in terminology is discussed more in the section that covers \"function\" in contemporary set theory.\n\nThe Wiener\u2013Hausdorff\u2013Kuratowski \"ordered pair\" definition 1914\u20131921\nThe history of the notion of \"ordered pair\" is not clear. As noted above, Frege (1879) proposed an intuitive ordering in his definition of a two-argument function \u03a8(A, B). Norbert Wiener in his 1914 (see below) observes that his own treatment essentially \"revert(s) to Schr\u00f6der's treatment of a relation as a class of ordered couples\".But Wiener offers no date or reference cf  in   considered the definition of a relation (such as \u03a8(A, B)) as a \"class of couples\" but rejected it:\n\"There is a temptation to regard a relation as definable in extension as a class of couples. This is the formal advantage that it avoids the necessity for the primitive proposition asserting that every couple has a relation holding between no other pairs of terms. But it is necessary to give sense to the couple, to distinguish the referent [domain] from the relatum [converse domain]: thus a couple becomes essentially distinct from a class of two terms, and must itself be introduced as a primitive idea. . . . It seems therefore more correct to take an intensional view of relations, and to identify them rather with class-concepts than with classes.\"\n\nBy 1910\u20131913 and Principia Mathematica Russell had given up on the requirement for an intensional definition of a relation, stating that \"mathematics is always concerned with extensions rather than intensions\" and \"Relations, like classes, are to be taken in extension\".both quotes from  To demonstrate the notion of a relation in extension Russell now embraced the notion of ordered couple: \"We may regard a relation ... as a class of couples ... the relation determined by \u03c6(x, y) is the class of couples (x, y) for which  \u03c6(x, y) is true\".   In a footnote he clarified his notion and arrived at this definition:\n\"Such a couple has a sense, i.e., the couple (x, y) is different from the couple (y, x) unless x = y. We shall call it a \"couple with sense,\" ... it may also be called an ordered couple. \nBut he goes on to say that he would not introduce the ordered couples further into his \"symbolic treatment\"; he proposes his \"matrix\" and his unpopular axiom of reducibility in their place.\n\nAn attempt to solve the problem of the antinomies led Russell to propose his \"doctrine of types\" in an appendix B of his 1903 The Principles of Mathematics. In a few years he would refine this notion and propose in his 1908 The Theory of Types two axioms of reducibility, the purpose of which were to reduce (single-variable) propositional functions and (dual-variable) relations to a \"lower\" form (and ultimately into a completely extensional form); he and Alfred North Whitehead would carry this treatment over to Principia Mathematica 1910\u20131913 with a further refinement called \"a matrix\". The first axiom is *12.1; the second is *12.11. To quote Wiener the second axiom *12.11 \"is involved only in the theory of relations\". in  Both axioms, however, were met with skepticism and resistance; see more at Axiom of reducibility. By 1914 Norbert Wiener, using Whitehead and Russell's symbolism, eliminated axiom *12.11 (the \"two-variable\" (relational) version of the axiom of reducibility) by expressing a relation as an ordered pair \"using the null set. At approximately the same time, Hausdorff (1914, p. 32) gave the definition of the ordered pair (a, b) as { {a,1}, {b, 2} }. A few years later Kuratowski (1921) offered a definition that has been widely used ever since, namely { {a, b}, {a} }\".commentary by van Heijenoort preceding  A simplification of the logic of relations in . As noted by  \"This definition . . . was historically important in reducing the theory of relations to the theory of sets.. This same point appears in van Heijenoort's commentary before  in .\n\nObserve that while Wiener \"reduced\" the relational *12.11 form of the axiom of reducibility he did not reduce nor otherwise change the propositional-function form *12.1; indeed he declared this \"essential to the treatment of identity, descriptions, classes and relations\". in \n\nSch\u00f6nfinkel's notion of \"function\" as a many-one \"correspondence\" 1924\nWhere exactly the general notion of \"function\" as a many-one correspondence derives from is unclear. Russell in his 1920 Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy states that \"It should be observed that all mathematical functions result form one-many [sic \u2013 contemporary usage is many-one] relations . . . Functions in this sense are descriptive functions\". A reasonable possibility is the Principia Mathematica notion of \"descriptive function\" \u2013 R 'y =DEF (\u03b9x)(x R y): \"the singular object that has a relation R to y\". Whatever the case, by 1924, Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel expressed the notion, claiming it to be \"well known\":\n\"As is well known, by function we mean in the simplest case a correspondence between the elements of some domain of quantities, the argument domain, and those of a domain of function values ... such that to each argument value there corresponds at most one function value\". On the building blocks of mathematical logic in \n\nAccording to Willard Quine,  \"provide[s] for ... the whole sweep of abstract set theory. The crux of the matter is that Sch\u00f6nfinkel lets functions stand as arguments. For Sch\u00f6nfinkel, substantially as for Frege, classes are special sorts of functions. They are propositional functions, functions whose values are truth values. All functions, propositional and otherwise, are for Sch\u00f6nfinkel one-place functions\".commentary by W. V. Quine preceding  On the building blocks of mathematical logic in . Remarkably, Sch\u00f6nfinkel reduces all mathematics to an extremely compact functional calculus consisting of only three functions: Constancy, fusion (i.e., composition), and mutual exclusivity. Quine notes that Haskell Curry (1958) carried this work forward \"under the head of combinatory logic\".cf Curry and Feys 1958; Quine in .\n\nVon Neumann's set theory 1925\nBy 1925 Abraham Fraenkel (1922) and Thoralf Skolem (1922) had amended Zermelo's set theory of 1908. But von Neumann was not convinced that this axiomatization could not lead to the antinomies.von Neumann's critique of the history observes the split between the logicists (e.g., Russell et. al.) and the set-theorists (e.g., Zermelo et. al.) and the formalists (e.g., Hilbert), cf  in . So he proposed his own theory, his 1925 An axiomatization of set theory.In addition to the 1925 appearance in van Heijenoort, Suppes 1970:12 cites two more: 1928a and 1929. It explicitly contains a \"contemporary\", set-theoretic version of the notion of \"function\":\n\"[Unlike Zermelo's set theory] [w]e prefer, however, to axiomatize not \"set\" but \"function\". The latter notion certainly includes the former. (More precisely, the two notions are completely equivalent, since a function can be regarded as a set of pairs, and a set as a function that can take two values.)\". in \n\nAt the outset he begins with I-objects and II-objects, two objects A and B that are I-objects (first axiom), and two types of \"operations\" that assume ordering as a structural propertyIn his 1930\u20131931 The Philosophy of Mathematics and Hilbert's Proof Theory Bernays asserts (in the context of rebutting Logicism's construction of the numbers from logical axioms) that \"the Number concept turns out to be an elementary structural concept\". This paper appears on page 243 in Paolo Mancosu 1998 From Brouwer to Hilbert, Oxford University Press, NY, . obtained of the resulting objects [x, y] and (x, y). The two \"domains of objects\" are called \"arguments\" (I-objects) and \"functions\" (II-objects); where they overlap are the \"argument functions\" (he calls them I-II objects). He introduces two \"universal two-variable operations\" \u2013 (i) the operation [x, y]: \". . . read 'the value of the function x for the argument y . . . it itself is a type I object\", and (ii) the operation (x, y): \". . . (read 'the ordered pair x, y') whose variables x and y must both be arguments and that itself produces an argument (x, y). Its most important property is that x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 follow from (x1 = y2) = (x2 = y2)\". To clarify the function pair he notes that \"Instead of f(x) we write [f,x] to indicate that f, just like x, is to be regarded as a variable in this procedure\". To avoid the \"antinomies of naive set theory, in Russell's first of all . . . we must forgo treating certain functions as arguments\".All quotes from  in  He adopts a notion from Zermelo to restrict these \"certain functions\".This notion is not easy to summarize; see more at .\n\nSuppesSee also van Heijenoort's introduction to von Neumann's paper on pages 393\u2013394. observes that von Neumann's axiomatization was modified by Bernays \"in order to remain nearer to the original Zermelo system . . . He introduced two membership relations: one between sets, and one between sets and classes\". Then G\u00f6del [1940]cf in particular p. 35 where G\u00f6del declares his primitive notions to be class, set, and \"the dyadic relation \u03b5 between class and class, class and set, set and class, or set and set\". G\u00f6del 1940 The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis with the axioms of set theory appearing on pages 33ff in Volume II of Kurt Godel Collected Works, Oxford University Press, NY,  (v.2, pbk). further modified the theory: \"his primitive notions are those of set, class and membership (although membership alone is sufficient)\".All quotes from  footnote. He also references \"a paper by R. M. Robinson [1937] [that] provides a simplified system close to von Neumann's original one\". This axiomatization is now known as von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory.\n\nBourbaki 1939\nIn 1939, Bourbaki, in addition to giving the well-known ordered pair definition of a function as a certain subset of the cartesian product E x F, gave the following:\n\n\"Let E and F be two sets, which may or may not be distinct. A relation between a variable element x of E and a variable element y of F is called a functional relation in y if, for all x \u2208 E, there exists a unique y \u2208 F which is in the given relation with x.\nWe give the name of function to the operation which in this way associates with every element x \u2208 E the element y \u2208 F which is in the given relation with x, and the function is said to be determined by the given functional relation. Two equivalent functional relations determine the same function.\"\n\nSince 1950\n\nNotion of \"function\" in contemporary set theory\nBoth axiomatic and naive forms of Zermelo's set theory as modified by Fraenkel (1922) and Skolem (1922) define \"function\" as a relation, define a relation as a set of ordered pairs, and define an ordered pair as a set of two \"dissymetric\" sets.\n\nWhile the reader of  Axiomatic Set Theory or  Naive Set Theory observes the use of function-symbolism in the axiom of separation, e.g., \u03c6(x) (in Suppes) and S(x) (in Halmos), they will see no mention of \"proposition\" or even \"first order predicate calculus\". In their place are \"expressions of the object language\", \"atomic formulae\", \"primitive formulae\", and \"atomic sentences\".\n\n defines the words as follows: \"In word languages, a proposition is expressed by a sentence. Then a 'predicate' is expressed by an incomplete sentence or sentence skeleton containing an open place. For example, \"___ is a man\" expresses a predicate ... The predicate is a propositional function of one variable. Predicates are often called 'properties' ... The predicate calculus will treat of the logic of predicates in this general sense of 'predicate', i.e., as propositional function\".\n\nIn 1954, Bourbaki, on p.\u00a076 in Chapitre II of Theorie des Ensembles (theory of sets), gave a definition of a function as a triple f = (F, A, B).  Here F is a functional graph, meaning a set of pairs where no two pairs have the same first member.  On p.\u00a077 (op. cit.) Bourbaki states (literal translation): \"Often we shall use, in the remainder of this Treatise, the word function instead of functional graph.\"\n\n in Axiomatic Set Theory, formally defines a relation (p.\u00a057) as a set of pairs, and a function (p.\u00a086) as a relation where no two pairs have the same first member.\n\nRelational form of a function\nThe reason for the disappearance of the words \"propositional function\" e.g., in , and , is explained by  together with further explanation of the terminology:\n\"An expression such as x is an integer, which contains variables and, on replacement of these variables by constants becomes a sentence, is called a SENTENTIAL [i.e., propositional cf his index] FUNCTION. But mathematicians, by the way, are not very fond of this expression, because they use the term \"function\" with a different meaning. ... sentential functions and sentences composed entirely of mathematical symbols (and not words of everyday language), such as: x + y = 5 are usually referred to by mathematicians as FORMULAE. In place of \"sentential function\" we shall sometimes simply say \"sentence\" \u2013 but only in cases where there is no danger of any misunderstanding\".\nFor his part Tarski calls the relational form of function a \"FUNCTIONAL RELATION or simply a FUNCTION\". After a discussion of this \"functional relation\" he asserts that:\n\"The concept of a function which we are considering now differs essentially from the concepts of a sentential [propositional] and of a designatory function .... Strictly speaking ... [these] do not belong to the domain of logic or mathematics; they denote certain categories of expressions which serve to compose logical and mathematical statements, but they do not denote things treated of in those statements... . The term \"function\" in its new sense, on the other hand, is an expression of a purely logical character; it designates a certain type of things dealt with in logic and mathematics.\"\nSee more about \"truth under an interpretation\" at Alfred Tarski.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  cf. his Chapter 1 Introduction.\n \n \n \n  With commentary by van Heijenoort.\n  With commentary by van Heijenoort.\n  With commentary by van Heijenoort.

{"title": "Infinity", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity", "text": "thumb|200px|right|The infinity symbol\nInfinity (symbol: ) is a concept describing something without any bound, or something larger than any natural number. Philosophers have speculated about the nature of the infinite, for example Zeno of Elea, who proposed many paradoxes involving infinity, and Eudoxus of Cnidus, who used the idea of infinitely small quantities in his method of exhaustion. This idea is also at the basis of infinitesimal calculus.\n\nAt the end of 19th century, Georg Cantor introduced and studied infinite sets and infinite numbers, which are now an essential part of the foundation of mathematics. Extract of page 616  For example, in modern mathematics, a line is viewed as the set of all its points, and their infinite number (the cardinality of the line) is larger than the number of integers. Thus the mathematical concept of infinity refines and extends the old philosophical concept. It is used everywhere in mathematics, even in areas, such as combinatorics and number theory that may seem to have nothing to do with it. For example, Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem uses the existence of very large infinite sets.\n\nThe concept of infinity is also used in physics and the other sciences.\n\nHistory\n\nAncient cultures had various ideas about the nature of infinity. The ancient Indians and Greeks did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept.\n\nEarly Greek\nThe earliest recorded idea of infinity comes from Anaximander, a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus. He used the word apeiron which means infinite or limitless. However, the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical infinity come from Zeno of Elea (born ), a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher of southern Italy and member of the Eleatic School founded by Parmenides. Aristotle called him the inventor of the dialectic. He is best known for his paradoxes, described by Bertrand Russell as \"immeasurably subtle and profound\".\n\nIn accordance with the traditional view of Aristotle, the Hellenistic Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the actual infinity; for example, instead of saying that there are an infinity of primes, Euclid prefers instead to say that there are more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of prime numbers.Euclid. Euclid's Elements, Book\u00a0IX, Proposition\u00a020.\n\nEarly Indian\nThe Jain mathematical text Surya Prajnapti (c. 4th\u20133rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:\n Enumerable: lowest, intermediate, and highest\n Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable, and innumerably innumerable\n Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite\n\nIn this work, two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and ontological grounds, a distinction was made between  (\"countless, innumerable\") and ananta (\"endless, unlimited\"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.\n\n17th century\nEuropean mathematicians started using infinite numbers and expressions in a systematic fashion in the 17th century. In 1655 John Wallis first used the notation  for such a number in his De sectionibus conicis and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into infinitesimal strips of width on the order of  But in Arithmetica infinitorum (1655 also) he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending \"&c.\" For example, \"1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &c.\"\n\nIn 1699 Isaac Newton wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas. Extract of p. 62\n\nMathematics\nHermann Weyl opened a mathematico-philosophic address given in 1930 with:\n\nInfinity symbol\n\nThe infinity symbol  (sometimes called the lemniscate) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. The symbol is encoded in Unicode at  and in LaTeX as \\infty.\n\nIt was introduced in 1655 by John Wallis, and, since its introduction, has also been used outside mathematics in modern mysticism and literary symbology.\n\nCalculus\n\nLeibniz, one of the co-inventors of infinitesimal calculus, speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics. To Leibniz, both infinitesimals and infinite quantities were ideal entities, not of the same nature as appreciable quantities, but enjoying the same properties in accordance with the Law of Continuity.\n\nReal analysis\n\nIn real analysis, the symbol , called \"infinity\", is used to denote an unbounded limit. The notation  means that\u00a0x grows without bound, and  means that \u00a0x decreases without bound. If f(t) \u2265 0 for every\u00a0t, thenThese uses of infinity for integrals and series can be found in any standard calculus text, such as, \n  means that f(t) does not bound a finite area from  to \n  means that the area under f(t) is infinite.\n  means that the total area under f(t) is finite, and equals \n\nInfinity is also used to describe infinite series:\n  means that the sum of the infinite series converges to some real value \n  means that the sum of the infinite series diverges in the specific sense that the partial sums grow without bound.\n\nInfinity can be used not only to define a limit but as a value in the extended real number system. Points labeled  and  can be added to the topological space of the real numbers, producing the two-point compactification of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the extended real numbers. We can also treat  and  as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the real projective line. Projective geometry also refers to a line at infinity in plane geometry, a plane at infinity in three-dimensional space, and a hyperplane at infinity for general dimensions, each consisting of points at infinity.\n\nComplex analysis\nthumb|right|250px|By stereographic projection, the complex plane can be \"wrapped\" onto a sphere, with the top point of the sphere corresponding to infinity. This is called the Riemann sphere.\n\nIn complex analysis the symbol , called \"infinity\", denotes an unsigned infinite limit.  means that the magnitude\u00a0 of\u00a0x grows beyond any assigned value. A point labeled  can be added to the complex plane as a topological space giving the one-point compactification of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional complex manifold, or Riemann surface, called the extended complex plane or the Riemann sphere. Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (therefore one exception is that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely  for any nonzero complex number\u00a0z. In this context it is often useful to consider meromorphic functions as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of  at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of M\u00f6bius transformations.\n\nNonstandard analysis\n450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (\u03b5) and infinites (\u03c9) on the hyperreal number line (1/\u03b5 = \u03c9/1)\n\nThe original formulation of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz used infinitesimal quantities. In the twentieth century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various logical systems, including smooth infinitesimal analysis and nonstandard analysis. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a hyperreal field; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian transfinites. For example, if\u00a0H is an infinite number, then H\u00a0+\u00a0H\u00a0=\u00a02H and H\u00a0+\u00a01 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to non-standard calculus is fully developed in .\n\nSet theory\n\nthumb|One-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset\n\nA different form of \"infinity\" are the ordinal and cardinal infinities of set theory. Georg Cantor developed a system of transfinite numbers, in which the first transfinite cardinal is aleph-null (\u21350), the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late nineteenth century from work by Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others, using the idea of collections, or sets.\n\nDedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of one-to-one correspondence as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (which derived from Euclid) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see Galileo's paradox where he concludes that positive integers which are squares and all positive integers are the same size). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its proper parts; this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite. The diagram gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. \"size\".\n\nCantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers. Ordinal numbers may be identified with well-ordered sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and the ordinary infinite sequences which are maps from the positive integers leads to mappings from ordinal numbers, and transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is countably infinite. If a set is too large to be put in one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called uncountable. Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity.  Certain extended number systems, such as the hyperreal numbers, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.\n\nCardinality of the continuum\n\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum  is greater than that of the natural numbers ; that is, there are more real numbers R than natural numbers N. Namely, Cantor showed that  (see Cantor's diagonal argument or Cantor's first uncountability proof).\n\nThe continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,   (see Beth one).  This hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, even assuming the Axiom of Choice.\n\nCardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space.\n\nthumb|The first three steps of a fractal construction whose limit is a space-filling curve, showing that there are as many points in a one-dimensional line as in a two-dimensional square.\nThe first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) and\u00a0R (see also Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel). The second result was proved by Cantor in\u00a01878, but only became intuitively apparent in\u00a01890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square.\n\nGeometry and topology\n\nInfinite-dimensional spaces are widely used in geometry and topology, particularly as classifying spaces, such as Eilenberg\u2212MacLane spaces. Common examples are the infinite-dimensional complex projective space K(Z,2) and the infinite-dimensional real projective space K(Z/2Z,1).\n\nFractals\nThe structure of a fractal object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming \"smooth\"; they have infinite perimeters\u2014some with infinite, and others with finite surface areas. One such fractal curve with an infinite perimeter and finite surface area is the Koch snowflake.\n\nMathematics without infinity\nLeopold Kronecker was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the philosophy of mathematics called finitism, an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of constructivism and intuitionism.\n\nPhysics\n\nIn physics, approximations of real numbers are used for continuous measurements and natural numbers are used for discrete measurements (i.e. counting). It is therefore assumed by physicists that no measurable quantity could have an infinite value,  for instance by taking an infinite value in an extended real number system, or by requiring the counting of an infinite number of events. It is, for example, presumed impossible for any type of body to have infinite mass or infinite energy. Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite plane wave exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.Doric Lenses  \u2013 Application Note \u2013 Axicons \u2013 2.

Retrieved 7 April 2014.\n\nCosmology\nThe first published proposal that the universe is infinite came from Thomas Digges in 1576.John Gribbin (2009), In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality, . p.\u00a088 Eight years later, in 1584, the Italian philosopher and astronomer Giordano Bruno proposed an unbounded universe in On the Infinite Universe and Worlds: \"Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the seven planets revolve around our sun. Living beings inhabit these worlds.\" Extract of p. 63\n\nCosmologists have long sought to discover whether infinity exists in our physical universe: Are there an infinite number of stars? Does the universe have infinite volume? Does space \"go on forever\"? This is an open question of cosmology. The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar topology. If so, one might eventually return to one's starting point after travelling in a straight line through the universe for long enough. Extract of p. 553\n\nThe curvature of the universe can be measured through multipole moments in the spectrum of the cosmic background radiation. As to date, analysis of the radiation patterns recorded by the WMAP spacecraft hints that the universe has a flat topology. This would be consistent with an infinite physical universe.\n\nHowever, the universe could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An easy way to understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.\n\nThe concept of infinity also extends to the multiverse hypothesis, which, when explained by astrophysicists such as Michio Kaku, posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.Kaku, M. (2006). Parallel worlds. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group.\n\nLogic\nIn logic an infinite regress argument is \"a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting to show that a thesis is defective because it generates an infinite series when either (form\u00a0A) no such series exists or (form\u00a0B) were it to exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g.,\u00a0of justification) that it is supposed to play.\"Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition, p.\u00a0429\n\nComputing\nThe IEEE\u00a0floating-point standard (IEEE 754) specifies the positive and negative infinity values (and also indefinite values). These are defined as the result of arithmetic overflow, division by zero, and other exceptional operations.\n\nSome programming languages, such as Java and J, allow the programmer an explicit access to the positive and negative infinity values as language constants. These can be used as greatest and least elements, as they compare (respectively) greater than or less than all other values. They have uses as sentinel values in algorithms involving sorting, searching, or windowing.\n\nIn languages that do not have greatest and least elements, but do allow overloading of relational operators, it is possible for a programmer to create the greatest and least elements. In languages that do not provide explicit access to such values from the initial state of the program, but do implement the floating-point data type, the infinity values may still be accessible and usable as the result of certain operations.\n\nIn programming, an infinite loop is a loop whose exit condition is never satisfied, thus theoretically executing indefinitely.\n\nArts, games, and cognitive sciences\nPerspective artwork utilizes the concept of vanishing points, roughly corresponding to mathematical points at infinity, located at an infinite distance from the observer.

{"title": "Inner product space", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space", "text": "thumb|300px|Geometric interpretation of the angle between two vectors defined using an inner product\nalt=Scalar product spaces, inner product spaces, Hermitian product spaces.|thumb|300px|Scalar product spaces, over any field, have \"scalar products\" that are symmetrical and linear in the first argument. Hermitian product spaces are restricted to the field of complex numbers and have \"Hermitian products\" that are conjugate-symmetrical and linear in the first argument. Inner product spaces may be defined over any field, having \"inner products\" that are linear in the first argument, conjugate-symmetrical, and positive-definite. Unlike inner products, scalar products and Hermitian products need not be positive-definite.\n\nIn linear algebra, an inner product space is a vector space with an additional structure called an inner product. This additional structure associates each pair of vectors in the space with a scalar quantity known as the inner product of the vectors. Inner products allow the rigorous introduction of intuitive geometrical notions such as the length of a vector or the angle between two vectors. They also provide the means of defining orthogonality between vectors (zero inner product). Inner product spaces generalize Euclidean spaces (in which the inner product is the dot product, also known as the scalar product) to vector spaces of any (possibly infinite) dimension, and are studied in functional analysis. The first usage of the concept of a vector space with an inner product is due to Giuseppe Peano, in 1898.\n\nAn inner product naturally induces an associated norm, thus an inner product space is also a normed vector space. A complete space with an inner product is called a Hilbert space. An (incomplete) space with an inner product is called a pre-Hilbert space, since its completion with respect to the norm induced by the inner product is a Hilbert space. Inner product spaces over the field of complex numbers are sometimes referred to as unitary spaces.\n\n Definition \nIn this article, the field of scalars denoted  is either the field of real numbers  or the field of complex numbers .\n\nFormally, an inner product space is a vector space  over the field  together with an inner product, i.e., with a map\n\nthat satisfies the following three properties for all vectors  and all scalars :\n\n Conjugate symmetry:A bar over an expression denotes complex conjugation; e.g.,  is the complex conjugation of . For real values,  and conjugate symmetry is just symmetry.\n \n Linearity in the first argument:\n \n Positive-definite:\n \n\n Elementary properties \nPositive-definiteness and linearity, respectively, ensure that:\n\nNotice that conjugate symmetry implies that  is real for all , since we have:\n \n\nConjugate symmetry and linearity in the first variable imply\n\nthat is, conjugate linearity in the second argument. So, an inner product is a sesquilinear form. Conjugate symmetry is also called Hermitian symmetry, and a conjugate-symmetric sesquilinear form is called a Hermitian form. While the above axioms are more mathematically economical, a compact verbal definition of an inner product is a positive-definite Hermitian form.\n\nThis important generalization of the familiar square expansion follows:\n \n\nThese properties, constituents of the above linearity in the first and second argument:\n\nare otherwise known as additivity.\n\nIn the case of , conjugate-symmetry reduces to symmetry, and sesquilinearity reduces to bilinearity. So, an inner product on a real vector space is a positive-definite symmetric bilinear form. That is,\n\nand the binomial expansion becomes:\n \n\n Alternative definitions, notations and remarks\nA common special case of the inner product, the scalar product or dot product, is written with a centered dot .\n\nSome authors, especially in physics and matrix algebra, prefer to define the inner product and the sesquilinear form with linearity in the second argument rather than the first. Then the first argument becomes conjugate linear, rather than the second. In those disciplines we would write the product  as  (the bra\u2013ket notation of quantum mechanics), respectively  (dot product as a case of the convention of forming the matrix product  as the dot products of rows of  with columns of ). Here the kets and columns are identified with the vectors of  and the bras and rows with the linear functionals (covectors) of the dual space , with conjugacy associated with duality. This reverse order is now occasionally followed in the more abstract literature, taking  to be conjugate linear in  rather than . A few instead find a middle ground by recognizing both  and  as distinct notations differing only in which argument is conjugate linear.\n\nThere are various technical reasons why it is necessary to restrict the basefield to  and  in the definition. Briefly, the basefield has to contain an ordered subfield in order for non-negativity to make sense,. and therefore has to have characteristic equal to 0 (since any ordered field has to have such characteristic). This immediately excludes finite fields. The basefield has to have additional structure, such as a distinguished automorphism. More generally any quadratically closed subfield of  or  will suffice for this purpose, e.g., the algebraic numbers or the constructible numbers. However in these cases when it is a proper subfield (i.e., neither  nor ) even finite-dimensional inner product spaces will fail to be metrically complete. In contrast all finite-dimensional inner product spaces over  or , such as those used in quantum computation, are automatically metrically complete and hence Hilbert spaces.\n\nIn some cases we need to consider non-negative semi-definite sesquilinear forms. This means that  is only required to be non-negative. We show how to treat these below.\n\n Examples \nReal numbers\n\nA simple example is the real numbers with the standard multiplication as the inner product\n\nEuclidean space\n\nMore generally, the real -space  with the dot product is an inner product space, an example of a Euclidean -space.\n\nwhere  is the transpose of .\n\nComplex coordinate space\n\nThe general form of an inner product on  is known as the Hermitian form and is given by\n\nwhere  is any Hermitian positive-definite matrix and  is the conjugate transpose of . For the real case this corresponds to the dot product of the results of directionally different scaling of the two vectors, with positive scale factors and orthogonal directions of scaling. Up to an orthogonal transformation it is a weighted-sum version of the dot product, with positive weights.\n\nHilbert space\n\nThe article on Hilbert space has several examples of inner product spaces wherein the metric induced by the inner product yields a complete metric space. An example of an inner product which induces an incomplete metric occurs with the space  of continuous complex valued functions f and g on the interval . The inner product is\n\nThis space is not complete; consider for example, for the interval  the sequence of continuous \"step\" functions, , defined by:\n\nThis sequence is a Cauchy sequence for the norm induced by the preceding inner product, which does not converge to a continuous function.\n\nRandom variables\n\nFor real random variables  and , the expected value of their product\n\nis an inner product. In this case,  if and only if  (i.e.,  almost surely). This definition of expectation as inner product can be extended to random vectors as well.\n\nReal matrices\n\nFor real square matrices of the same size,  with transpose as conjugation\n\nis an inner product.\n\nVector spaces with forms\nOn an inner product space, or more generally a vector space with a nondegenerate form (so an isomorphism ) vectors can be sent to covectors (in coordinates, via transpose), so one can take the inner product and outer product of two vectors, not simply of a vector and a covector.\n\n Norms on inner product spaces \nA linear space with a norm such as:\n\nis a normed space but not an inner product space, because this norm does not satisfy the parallelogram equality required of a norm to have an inner product associated with it.\n\nHowever, inner product spaces have a naturally defined norm based upon the inner product of the space itself that does satisfy the parallelogram equality:\n\nThis is well defined by the nonnegativity axiom of the definition of inner product space. The norm is thought of as the length of the vector . Directly from the axioms, we can prove the following:\n\n Orthonormal sequences \nLet  be a finite dimensional inner product space of dimension . Recall that every basis of  consists of exactly  linearly independent vectors. Using the Gram\u2013Schmidt process we may start with an arbitrary basis and transform it into an orthonormal basis. That is, into a basis in which all the elements are orthogonal and have unit norm. In symbols, a basis  is orthonormal if  for every  and  for each .\n\nThis definition of orthonormal basis generalizes to the case of infinite-dimensional inner product spaces in the following way. Let  be any inner product space. Then a collection\n\nis a basis for  if the subspace of  generated by finite linear combinations of elements of  is dense in  (in the norm induced by the inner product). We say that  is an orthonormal basis for  if it is a basis and\n\nif  and  for all .\n\nUsing an infinite-dimensional analog of the Gram-Schmidt process one may show:\n\nTheorem. Any separable inner product space  has an orthonormal basis.\n\nUsing the Hausdorff maximal principle and the fact that in a complete inner product space orthogonal projection onto linear subspaces is well-defined, one may also show that\n\nTheorem. Any complete inner product space  has an orthonormal basis.\n\nThe two previous theorems raise the question of whether all inner product spaces have an orthonormal basis. The answer, it turns out is negative. This is a non-trivial result, and is proved below. The following proof is taken from Halmos's A Hilbert Space Problem Book (see the references).\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"90%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Proof\n|-\n| Recall that the dimension of an inner product space is the cardinality of a maximal orthonormal system that it contains (by Zorn's lemma it contains at least one, and any two have the same cardinality). An orthonormal basis is certainly a maximal orthonormal system, but as we shall see, the converse need not hold. Observe that if  is a dense subspace of an inner product space , then any orthonormal basis for  is automatically an orthonormal basis for . Thus, it suffices to construct an inner product space  with a dense subspace  whose dimension is strictly smaller than that of .\n\nLet  be a Hilbert space of dimension  (for instance, ). Let  be an orthonormal basis of , so . Extend  to a Hamel basis  for , where . Since it is known that the Hamel dimension of  is , the cardinality of the continuum, it must be that .\n\nLet  be a Hilbert space of dimension  (for instance, ). Let  be an orthonormal basis for , and let  be a bijection. Then there is a linear transformation  such that  for , and  for .\n\nLet  and let  be the graph of . Let  be the closure of  in ; we will show . Since for any  we have , it follows that .\n\nNext, if , then  for some , so ; since  as well, we also have . It follows that , so , and  is dense in .\n\nFinally,  is a maximal orthonormal set in ; if\n\nfor all  then certainly , so  is the zero vector in . Hence the dimension of  is , whereas it is clear that the dimension of  is . This completes the proof.\n|}\n\nParseval's identity leads immediately to the following theorem:\n\nTheorem. Let  be a separable inner product space and  an orthonormal basis of\u00a0. Then the map\n\nis an isometric linear map  with a dense image.\n\nThis theorem can be regarded as an abstract form of Fourier series, in which an arbitrary orthonormal basis plays the role of the sequence of trigonometric polynomials. Note that the underlying index set can be taken to be any countable set (and in fact any set whatsoever, provided  is defined appropriately, as is explained in the article Hilbert space). In particular, we obtain the following result in the theory of Fourier series:\n\nTheorem. Let  be the inner product space . Then the sequence (indexed on set of all integers) of continuous functions\n\nis an orthonormal basis of the space  with the  inner product. The mapping\n\nis an isometric linear map with dense image.\n\nOrthogonality of the sequence  follows immediately from the fact that if , then\n\nNormality of the sequence is by design, that is, the coefficients are so chosen so that the norm comes out to 1. Finally the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, in the inner product norm, follows from the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, this time in the space of continuous periodic functions on  with the uniform norm. This is the content of the Weierstrass theorem on the uniform density of trigonometric polynomials.\n\nOperators on inner product spaces\nSeveral types of linear maps  from an inner product space  to an inner product space  are of relevance:\n Continuous linear maps, i.e.,  is linear and continuous with respect to the metric defined above, or equivalently,  is linear and the set of non-negative reals , where  ranges over the closed unit ball of , is bounded.\n Symmetric linear operators, i.e.,  is linear and  for all ,  in .\n Isometries, i.e.,  is linear and  for all ,  in , or equivalently,  is linear and  for all  in . All isometries are injective. Isometries are morphisms between inner product spaces, and morphisms of real inner product spaces are orthogonal transformations (compare with orthogonal matrix).\n Isometrical isomorphisms, i.e.,  is an isometry which is surjective (and hence bijective). Isometrical isomorphisms are also known as unitary operators (compare with unitary matrix).\n\nFrom the point of view of inner product space theory, there is no need to distinguish between two spaces which are isometrically isomorphic. The spectral theorem provides a canonical form for symmetric, unitary and more generally normal operators on finite dimensional inner product spaces. A generalization of the spectral theorem holds for continuous normal operators in Hilbert spaces.\n\n Generalizations \nAny of the axioms of an inner product may be weakened, yielding generalized notions. The generalizations that are closest to inner products occur where bilinearity and conjugate symmetry are retained, but positive-definiteness is weakened.\n\n Degenerate inner products \nIf  is a vector space and  a semi-definite sesquilinear form, then the function:\n\nmakes sense and satisfies all the properties of norm except that  does not imply  (such a functional is then called a semi-norm). We can produce an inner product space by considering the quotient }. The sesquilinear form  factors through .\n\nThis construction is used in numerous contexts. The Gelfand\u2013Naimark\u2013Segal construction is a particularly important example of the use of this technique. Another example is the representation of semi-definite kernels on arbitrary sets.\n\n Nondegenerate conjugate symmetric forms \n\nAlternatively, one may require that the pairing be a nondegenerate form, meaning that for all non-zero  there exists some  such that , though  need not equal ; in other words, the induced map to the dual space  is injective. This generalization is important in differential geometry: a manifold whose tangent spaces have an inner product is a Riemannian manifold, while if this is related to nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form the manifold is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. By Sylvester's law of inertia, just as every inner product is similar to the dot product with positive weights on a set of vectors, every nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form is similar to the dot product with nonzero weights on a set of vectors, and the number of positive and negative weights are called respectively the positive index and negative index. Product of vectors in Minkowski space is an example of indefinite inner product, although, technically speaking, it is not an inner product according to the standard definition above. Minkowski space has four dimensions and indices 3 and 1 (assignment of \"+\" and \"\u2212\" to them differs depending on conventions).\n\nPurely algebraic statements (ones that do not use positivity) usually only rely on the nondegeneracy (the injective homomorphism ) and thus hold more generally.\n\nRelated products\nThe term \"inner product\" is opposed to outer product, which is a slightly more general opposite. Simply, in coordinates, the inner product is the product of a  covector with an  vector, yielding a 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 matrix (a scalar), while the outer product is the product of an  vector with a  covector, yielding an  matrix. Note that the outer product is defined for different dimensions, while the inner product requires the same dimension. If the dimensions are the same, then the inner product is the trace of the outer product (trace only being properly defined for square matrices).  In a quip: \"inner is horizontal times vertical and shrinks down, outer is vertical times horizontal and expands out\".\n\nMore abstractly, the outer product is the bilinear map  sending a vector and a covector to a rank 1 linear transformation (simple tensor of type (1, 1)), while the inner product is the bilinear evaluation map  given by evaluating a covector on a vector; the order of the domain vector spaces here reflects the covector/vector distinction.\n\nThe inner product and outer product should not be confused with the interior product and exterior product, which are instead operations on vector fields and differential forms, or more generally on the exterior algebra.\n\nAs a further complication, in geometric algebra the inner product and the exterior (Grassmann) product are combined in the geometric product (the Clifford product in a Clifford algebra) \u2013 the inner product sends two vectors (1-vectors) to a scalar (a 0-vector), while the exterior product sends two vectors to a bivector (2-vector) \u2013 and in this context the exterior product is usually called the outer product (alternatively, wedge product). The inner product is more correctly called a scalar product in this context, as the nondegenerate quadratic form in question need not be positive definite (need not be an inner product).\n\nSee also\n Space (mathematics)\n Semi-inner-product\n Normed vector space\n Energetic space\n Dual space\n Biorthogonal system\n Bilinear form\n\n Notes \n\n References \n\n Sources \n \n \n \n\nCategory:Normed spaces\nCategory:Bilinear forms"}

{"title": "Jordan measure", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_measure", "text": "In mathematics, the Peano\u2013Jordan measure (also known as the Jordan content) is an extension of the notion of size (length, area, volume) to shapes more complicated than,  for example, a triangle, disk, or parallelepiped.\n\nIt turns out that for a set to have Jordan measure it should be well-behaved in a certain restrictive sense. For this reason, it is now more common to work with the Lebesgue measure, which is an extension of the Jordan measure to a larger class of sets. Historically speaking, the Jordan measure came first, towards the end of the nineteenth century.  For historical reasons, the term Jordan measure is now well-established, despite the fact that it is not a true measure in its modern definition, since Jordan-measurable sets do not form a \u03c3-algebra. For example, singleton sets in  each have a Jordan measure of 0, while , a countable union of them, is not Jordan-measurable.While a set whose measure is defined is termed measurable, there is no commonly accepted term to describe a set whose Jordan content is defined.  Munkres (1991) suggests the term \"rectifiable\" as a generalization of the use of this term to describe curves.  Other authors have used terms including \"admissible\" (Lang, Zorich); \"pavable\" (Hubbard); \"have content\" (Burkill); \"contented\" (Loomis and Sternberg).  For this reason, some authors prefer to use the term Jordan content (see the article on content).  \n\nThe Peano-Jordan measure is named after its originators, the French mathematician Camille Jordan, and the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano.G. Peano, \"Applicazioni geometriche del calcolo infinitesimale\", Fratelli Bocca, Torino, 1887.\n\nJordan measure of \"simple sets\"\nright|thumb|A simple set is, by definition, a union of (possibly overlapping) rectangles.\nright|thumb|The simple set from above decomposed as a union of non-overlapping rectangles.\nConsider the Euclidean space Rn. One starts by considering products of bounded intervals \n\nwhich are closed at the left end and open at the right end (half-open intervals is a technical choice; as we see below, one can use closed or open intervals if preferred). Such a set will be called a n-dimensional rectangle, or simply a rectangle.  One defines the Jordan measure of such a rectangle to be the product of the lengths of the intervals:\n\nNext, one considers simple sets, sometimes called polyrectangles, which are finite unions of rectangles,\n\n \n\nfor any k\u22651.\n\nOne cannot define the Jordan measure of S as simply the sum of the measures of the individual rectangles, because such a representation of S is far from unique, and there could be significant overlaps between the rectangles.\n\nLuckily, any such simple set S can be rewritten as a union of another finite family of rectangles, rectangles which this time are mutually disjoint, and then one defines the Jordan measure m(S) as the sum of measures of the disjoint rectangles.\n\nOne can show that this definition of the Jordan measure of S is independent of the  representation of S as a finite union of disjoint rectangles. It is in the \"rewriting\" step that the assumption of rectangles being made of half-open intervals is used.\n\nExtension to more complicated sets\nright|thumb|A set (represented in the picture by the region inside the blue curve) is Jordan measurable if and only if it can be well-approximated both from the inside and outside by simple sets (their boundaries are shown in dark green and dark pink respectively).\n\nNotice that a set which is a product of closed intervals,\n\nis not a simple set, and neither is a ball. Thus, so far the set of Jordan measurable sets is still very limited. The key step is then defining a bounded set to be Jordan measurable if it is \"well-approximated\" by simple sets, exactly in the same way as a function is Riemann integrable if it is well-approximated by piecewise-constant functions.\n\nFormally, for a bounded set B, define its inner Jordan measure as \n\nand its outer measure as \n\nwhere the infimum and supremum are taken over simple sets S. The set B is said to be Jordan measurable if the inner measure of B equals the outer measure.  The common value of the two measures is then simply called the Jordan measure of B.\n\nIt turns out that all rectangles (open or closed), as well as all balls, simplexes, etc., are Jordan measurable. Also, if one considers two continuous functions, the set of points between the graphs of those functions is Jordan measurable as long as that set is bounded and the common domain of the two functions is Jordan measurable. Any finite union and intersection of Jordan measurable sets is Jordan measurable, as well as the set difference of any two Jordan measurable sets. A compact set is not necessarily Jordan measurable. For example, the fat Cantor set is not. Its inner Jordan measure vanishes, since its complement is dense; however, its outer Jordan measure does not vanish, since it cannot be less than (in fact, is equal to) its Lebesgue measure. Also, a bounded open set is not necessarily Jordan measurable. For example, the complement of the fat Cantor set (within the interval) is not. A bounded set is Jordan measurable if and only if its indicator function is Riemann-integrable.\n\nEquivalently, for a bounded set B the inner Jordan measure of B is the Lebesgue measure of the interior of B and the outer Jordan measure is the Lebesgue measure of the closure. From this it follows that a bounded set is Jordan measurable if and only if its boundary has Lebesgue measure zero. (Or equivalently, if the boundary has Jordan measure zero; the equivalence holds due to compactness of the boundary.)\n\nThe Lebesgue measure\nThis last property greatly limits the types of sets which are Jordan measurable. For example, the set of rational numbers contained in the interval [0,1] is then not Jordan measurable, as its boundary is [0,1] which is not of Jordan measure zero. Intuitively however, the set of rational numbers is a \"small\" set, as it is countable, and it should have \"size\" zero. That is indeed true, but only if one replaces the Jordan measure with the Lebesgue measure. The Lebesgue measure of a set is the same as its Jordan measure as long as that set has a Jordan measure. However, the Lebesgue measure is defined for a much wider class of sets, like the set of rational numbers in an interval mentioned earlier, and also for sets which may be unbounded or fractals. Also, the Lebesgue measure, unlike the Jordan measure, is a true measure, that is, any countable union of Lebesgue measurable sets is Lebesgue measurable, whereas countable unions of Jordan measurable sets need not be Jordan measurable.\n\nReferences\n \n \n\n External links \n\nCategory:Measures (measure theory)"}

The theorem was conjectured by Andrew V\u00e1zsonyi and proved by ; a short proof was given by  . It has since become a prominent example in reverse mathematics as a statement that cannot be proved within ATR0 (a form of arithmetical transfinite recursion),  and a finitary application of the theorem gives the existence of the notoriously fast-growing TREE function.\n\nIn 2004, the result was generalized from trees to graphs as the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem, a result that has also proved important in reverse mathematics and leads to the even-faster-growing SSCG function.\n\nStatement\nWe give the version proved by Nash-Williams; Kruskal's formulation is somewhat stronger. All trees we consider are finite. \n\nGiven a tree  with a root, and given vertices , , call  a successor of  if the unique path from the root to  contains , and call  an immediate successor of  if additionally the path from to  to  contains no other vertex. \n\nTake  to be a partially ordered set.

(That is to say, given any infinite sequence  of rooted trees labeled in , there is some  so that .)\n\nWeak tree function\nDefine tree(n), the weak tree function, as the length of the longest sequence of 1-labelled trees (i.e. ) such that:\n\n The tree at position k  in the sequence has no more than k + n vertices, for all k.\n No tree is homeomorphically embeddable into any tree following it in the sequence.\n\nIt is known that tree(1) = 2, tree(2) = 5, and tree(3) > 262140, but TREE(3) (see below) is larger than treetreetreetreetree8(7)(7)(7)(7)(7).\n\nFriedman's work\nFor a countable label set , Kruskal's tree theorem can be expressed and proven using second-order arithmetic. However, like Goodstein's theorem or the Paris\u2013Harrington theorem, some special cases and variants of the theorem can be expressed in subsystems of second-order arithmetic much weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first observed by Harvey Friedman in the early 1980's, an early success of the then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where  has order one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in ATR0,Simpson 1985, Theorem 1.8 thus giving the first example of a predicative result with a provably impredicative proof.Friedman 2002, p.\u00a060 This case of the theorem is still provable in \u03a0-CA0, but by adding a \"gap condition\" Simpson 1985, Definition 4.1 to the definition of the order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem unprovable in this system.Simpson 1985, Theorem 5.14Marcone 2001, p.\u00a08\u20139 Much later, the Robertson-Seymour theorem would give another theorem unprovable inside \u03a0-CA0.\n\nOrdinal analysis confirms the strength of Kruskal's theorem, with the proof-theoretic ordinal of the theorem equaling the small Veblen ordinal (sometimes confused with the smaller Ackermann ordinal).\n\nTREE(3)\nSuppose that P(n) is the statement:\n\nThere is some m such that if T1,...,Tm is a finite sequence of unlabeled rooted trees where Tk has n+k vertices, then Ti\u00a0\u2264\u00a0Tj for some i < j.\n\nAll the statements P(n) are true as a consequence of Kruskal's theorem and K\u0151nig's lemma. For each n, Peano arithmetic can prove that P(n) is true, but Peano arithmetic cannot prove the statement \"P(n) is true for all n\".Smith 1985, p.\u00a0120  Moreover the length of the shortest proof of P(n) in Peano arithmetic grows phenomenally fast as a function of n; far faster than any primitive recursive function or the Ackermann function for example. The least m for which P(n) holds similarly grows extremely quickly with n.\n\nBy incorporating labels, Friedman defined a far-faster growing function. For a positive integer n, take TREE(n) to be the largest m so that we have the following:\n\nThere is a sequence T1,...,Tm of rooted trees labelled from a set of n  labels, where each Ti has at most i vertices, such that Ti \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 Tj does not hold for any i < j \u00a0\u2264\u00a0m.\n\nThe TREE sequence begins TREE(1) = 1, TREE(2) = 3, then suddenly TREE(3) explodes to a value so enormously large that many other \"large\" combinatorial constants, such as Friedman's n(4), are extremely small by comparison. In fact, it is much larger than nn(5)(5). A lower bound for n(4), and hence an extremely weak lower bound for TREE(3), is A(A(...A(1)...)), where the number of A'''s is A(187196), and A() is a version of Ackermann's function: A(x) = 2 [x+1] x in hyperoperation. Graham's number, for example, is approximately A64(4), which is much smaller than the lower bound AA(187196)(1). It can be shown that the growth-rate of the function TREE is at least  in the fast-growing hierarchy.\n\nSee also\nParis\u2013Harrington theorem\nKanamori\u2013McAloon theorem\nRobertson\u2013Seymour theorem\n\nNotes\n Friedman originally denoted this function by TR[n].\n n(k) is defined as the length of the longest possible sequence that can be constructed with a k-letter alphabet such that no block of letters xi,...,x2i is a subsequence of any later block xj,...,x2j. n(1) = 3, n(2) = 11 and n''(3) > 2 [7199] 158386.\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n \n\nCategory:Mathematical logic\nCategory:Theorems in discrete mathematics\nCategory:Order theory\nCategory:Wellfoundedness\nCategory:Trees (graph theory)"}
{"title": "Kurt G\u00f6del", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del", "text": "Kurt Friedrich G\u00f6del (; ; April 28, 1906\u00a0\u2013 January 14, 1978) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Austrian, and later American, logician, mathematician, and philosopher. Considered along with Aristotle, Alfred Tarski and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, G\u00f6del had an immense effect upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as Bertrand Russell,For instance, in their Principia Mathematica (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy edition). Alfred North Whitehead, and David Hilbert were analyzing the use of logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics pioneered by Georg Cantor.\n\nG\u00f6del published his two incompleteness theorems in 1931 when he was 25 years old, one year after finishing his doctorate at the University of Vienna. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the axioms. To prove this theorem, G\u00f6del developed a technique now known as G\u00f6del numbering, which codes formal expressions as natural numbers.\n\nHe also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory, assuming these axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and modal logic.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nChildhood\nG\u00f6del was born April 28, 1906, in Br\u00fcnn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) into the German family of Rudolf G\u00f6del (1874\u20131929), the manager of a textile factory, and Marianne G\u00f6del (n\u00e9e Handschuh, 1879\u20131966).Dawson 1997, pp. 3\u20134. Throughout his life, G\u00f6del would remain close to his mother; their correspondence was frequent and wide-ranging. At the time of his birth the city had a German-speaking majority which included his parents.Dawson 1997, p.\u00a012 His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised Protestant. The ancestors of Kurt G\u00f6del were often active in Br\u00fcnn's cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph G\u00f6del was a famous singer of that time and for some years a member of the  (Men's Choral Union of Br\u00fcnn).Proch\u00e1zka 2008, pp. 30\u201334.\n\nG\u00f6del automatically became a Czechoslovak citizen at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up at the end of World War I. (According to his classmate , like many residents of the predominantly German , \"G\u00f6del considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia\".Dawson 1997, p.\u00a015. He chose to become an Austrian citizen at age 23. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, G\u00f6del automatically became a German citizen at age 32. After World War II (1948), at the age of 42, he became an American citizen.\n\nIn his family, young Kurt was known as  (\"Mr. Why\") because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, G\u00f6del suffered from \"frequent episodes of poor health\", which would continue for his entire life.\n\nG\u00f6del attended the , a Lutheran school in Br\u00fcnn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the  from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Kurt had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for Vienna to go to medical school at the University of Vienna. During his teens, Kurt studied Gabelsberger shorthand, Goethe's Theory of Colours and criticisms of Isaac Newton, and the writings of Immanuel Kant.\n\nStudying in Vienna\nAt the age of 18, G\u00f6del joined his brother in Vienna and entered the University of Vienna. By that time, he had already mastered university-level mathematics.Dawson 1997, p.\u00a024. Although initially intending to study theoretical physics, he also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy. During this time, he adopted ideas of mathematical realism. He read Kant's , and participated in the Vienna Circle with Moritz Schlick, Hans Hahn, and Rudolf Carnap. G\u00f6del then studied number theory, but when he took part in a seminar run by Moritz Schlick which studied Bertrand Russell's book Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, he became interested in mathematical logic. According to G\u00f6del, mathematical logic was \"a science prior to all others, which contains the ideas and principles underlying all sciences.\"Gleick, J. (2011) The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood, London, Fourth Estate, p. 181.\n\nAttending a lecture by David Hilbert in Bologna on completeness and consistency of mathematical systems may have set G\u00f6del's life course. In 1928, Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann published  (Principles of Mathematical Logic), an introduction to first-order logic in which the problem of completeness was posed: Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system?\n\nThis problem became the topic that G\u00f6del chose for his doctoral work. In 1929, at the age of 23, he completed his doctoral dissertation under Hans Hahn's supervision. In it, he established his eponymous completeness theorem regarding the first-order predicate calculus. He was awarded his doctorate in 1930, and his thesis (accompanied by some additional work) was published by the Vienna Academy of Science.\n\nCareer\n\nIncompleteness theorem\n\nIn 1930 G\u00f6del attended the Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences, held in K\u00f6nigsberg, 5\u20137 September. Here he delivered his incompleteness theorems.\n\nG\u00f6del published his incompleteness theorems in  (called in English \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions of  and Related Systems\"). In that article, he proved for any computable axiomatic system that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (e.g., the Peano axioms or Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice), that:\n If a (logical or axiomatic formal) system is consistent, it cannot be complete.\n The consistency of axioms cannot be proved within their own system.\nThese theorems ended a half-century of attempts, beginning with the work of Frege and culminating in  and Hilbert's formalism, to find a set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics.\n\nIn hindsight, the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple. G\u00f6del essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system. If it were provable, it would be false.\nThus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement.\nThat is, for any computably enumerable set of axioms for arithmetic (that is, a set that can in principle be printed out by an idealized computer with unlimited resources), there is a formula that is true of arithmetic, but which is not provable in that system.\nTo make this precise, however, G\u00f6del needed to produce a method to encode (as natural numbers) statements, proofs, and the concept of provability; he did this using a process known as G\u00f6del numbering.\n\nIn his two-page paper  (1932) G\u00f6del refuted the finite-valuedness of intuitionistic logic. In the proof, he implicitly used what has later become known as G\u00f6del\u2013Dummett intermediate logic (or G\u00f6del fuzzy logic).\n\nMid-1930s: further work and U.S. visits\nG\u00f6del earned his habilitation at Vienna in 1932, and in 1933 he became a  (unpaid lecturer) there. In 1933 Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, and over the following years the Nazis rose in influence in Austria, and among Vienna's mathematicians. In June 1936, Moritz Schlick, whose seminar had aroused G\u00f6del's interest in logic, was assassinated by one of his former students, Johann Nelb\u00f6ck.  This triggered \"a severe nervous crisis\" in G\u00f6del.. From p.\u00a080, which quotes Rudolf G\u00f6del, Kurt's brother and a medical doctor. The words \"a severe nervous crisis\", and the judgement that the Schlick assassination was its trigger, are from the Rudolf G\u00f6del quote. Rudolf knew Kurt well in those years. He developed paranoid symptoms, including a fear of being poisoned, and spent several months in a sanitarium for nervous diseases.Dawson 1997, pp. 110\u201312\n\nIn 1933, G\u00f6del first traveled to the U.S., where he met Albert Einstein, who became a good friend.Hutchinson Encyclopedia (1988), p.\u00a0518 He delivered an address to the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society. During this year, G\u00f6del also developed the ideas of computability and recursive functions to the point where he was able to present a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth. This work was developed in number theory, using G\u00f6del numbering.\n\nIn 1934 G\u00f6del gave a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, entitled On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems. Stephen Kleene, who had just completed his PhD at Princeton, took notes of these lectures that have been subsequently published.\n\nG\u00f6del visited the IAS again in the autumn of 1935. The traveling and the hard work had exhausted him, and the next year he took a break to recover from a depressive episode. He returned to teaching in 1937. During this time, he worked on the proof of consistency of the axiom of choice and of the continuum hypothesis; he went on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory.\n\nHe married Adele Nimbursky (n\u00e9e Porkert, 1899\u20131981), whom he had known for over 10 years, on September 20, 1938.\nTheir relationship had been opposed by his parents on the grounds that she was a divorced dancer, six years older than he was.\n\nSubsequently, he left for another visit to the United States, spending the autumn of 1938 at the IAS and publishing Consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory, a classic of modern mathematics. In that work he introduced the constructible universe, a model of set theory in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. G\u00f6del showed that both the axiom of choice (AC) and the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) are true in the constructible universe, and therefore must be consistent with the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms for set theory (ZF). This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians, as it means they can assume the axiom of choice when proving the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem. Paul Cohen later constructed a model of ZF in which AC and GCH are false; together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory.\n\nGodel spent the spring of 1939 at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nPrinceton, Einstein, U.S. citizenship\nAfter the Anschluss on 12 March 1938, Austria had become a part of Nazi Germany.\nGermany abolished the title , so G\u00f6del had to apply for a different position under the new order. His former association with Jewish members of the Vienna Circle, especially with Hahn, weighed against him. The University of Vienna turned his application down.\n\nHis predicament intensified when the German army found him fit for conscription. World War II started in September 1939.\nBefore the year was up, G\u00f6del and his wife left Vienna for Princeton. To avoid the difficulty of an Atlantic crossing, the G\u00f6dels took the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Pacific, sailed from Japan to San Francisco (which they reached on March 4, 1940), then crossed the US by train to Princeton. There G\u00f6del accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), which he had previously visited during 1933\u201334.\n\nAlbert Einstein was also living at Princeton during this time. G\u00f6del and Einstein developed a strong friendship, and were known to take long walks together to and from the Institute for Advanced Study. The nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other Institute members. Economist Oskar Morgenstern recounts that toward the end of his life Einstein confided that his \"own work no longer meant much, that he came to the Institute merely ... to have the privilege of walking home with G\u00f6del\".Goldstein (2005), p.\u00a033.\n\nG\u00f6del and his wife, Adele, spent the summer of 1942 in Blue Hill, Maine, at the Blue Hill Inn at the top of the bay. G\u00f6del was not merely vacationing but had a very productive summer of work. Using  [volume 15] of G\u00f6del's still-unpublished  [working notebooks], John W. Dawson Jr. conjectures that G\u00f6del discovered a proof for the independence of the axiom of choice from finite type theory, a weakened form of set theory, while in Blue Hill in 1942. G\u00f6del's close friend Hao Wang supports this conjecture, noting that G\u00f6del's Blue Hill notebooks contain his most extensive treatment of the problem.\n\nOn December 5, 1947, Einstein and Morgenstern accompanied G\u00f6del to his U.S. citizenship exam, where they acted as witnesses. G\u00f6del had confided in them that he had discovered an inconsistency in the U.S. Constitution that could allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship. Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friend's unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application. The judge turned out to be Phillip Forman, who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einstein's own citizenship hearing. Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask G\u00f6del if he thought a dictatorship like the Nazi regime could happen in the U.S. G\u00f6del then started to explain his discovery to Forman. Forman understood what was going on, cut G\u00f6del off, and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion.Dawson 1997, pp. 179\u201380. The story of G\u00f6del's citizenship hearing is repeated in many versions. Dawson's account is the most carefully researched, but was written before the rediscovery of Morgenstern's written account. Most other accounts appear to be based on Dawson, hearsay or speculation.\n\nG\u00f6del became a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946. Around this time he stopped publishing, though he continued to work. He became a full professor at the Institute in 1953 and an emeritus professor in 1976.\n\nDuring his many years at the Institute, G\u00f6del's interests turned to philosophy and physics. In 1949, he demonstrated the existence of solutions involving closed timelike curves, to Einstein's field equations in general relativity. He is said to have given this elaboration to Einstein as a present for his 70th birthday. His \"rotating universes\" would allow time travel to the past and caused Einstein to have doubts about his own theory. His solutions are known as the G\u00f6del metric (an exact solution of the Einstein field equation).\n\nHe studied and admired the works of Gottfried Leibniz, but came to believe that a hostile conspiracy had caused some of Leibniz's works to be suppressed. To a lesser extent he studied Immanuel Kant and Edmund Husserl. In the early 1970s, G\u00f6del circulated among his friends an elaboration of Leibniz's version of Anselm of Canterbury's ontological proof of God's existence. This is now known as G\u00f6del's ontological proof.\n\nAwards and honours\nG\u00f6del was awarded (with Julian Schwinger) the first Albert Einstein Award in 1951, and was also awarded the National Medal of Science, in 1974. G\u00f6del was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1968. He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The G\u00f6del Prize, an annual prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science, is named after him.\n\nright|thumb|200px|Gravestone of Kurt and Adele G\u00f6del in the Princeton, N.J., cemetery\n\nLater life and death\nLater in his life, G\u00f6del suffered periods of mental instability and illness. He had an obsessive fear of being poisoned; he would eat only food that his wife, Adele, prepared for him. Late in 1977, she was hospitalized for six months and could no longer prepare her husband's food. In her absence, he refused to eat, eventually starving to death. He weighed  when he died. His death certificate reported that he died of \"malnutrition and inanition caused by personality disturbance\" in Princeton Hospital on January 14, 1978. He was buried in Princeton Cemetery. Adele's death followed in 1981.\n\nPersonal life\n\nReligious views\nG\u00f6del was a convinced theist, in the Christian tradition. He held the notion that God was personal.\n\nHe believed firmly in an afterlife, stating: \"Of course this supposes that there are many relationships which today's science and received wisdom haven't any inkling of. But I am convinced of this [the afterlife], independently of any theology.\" It is \"possible today to perceive, by pure reasoning\" that it \"is entirely consistent with known facts.\"  \"If the world is rationally constructed and has meaning, then there must be such a thing [as an afterlife].\"Hao Wang, \"A Logical Journey: From G\u00f6del to Philosophy\", 1996, pp. 104\u201305.\n\nIn an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, G\u00f6del described his religion as \"baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is theistic, not pantheistic, following Leibniz rather than Spinoza.\"G\u00f6del's answer to a special questionnaire sent him by the sociologist Burke Grandjean. This answer is quoted directly in Wang 1987, p.\u00a018, and indirectly in Wang 1996, p.\u00a0112. It's also quoted directly in Dawson 1997, p.\u00a06, who cites Wang 1987. The Grandjean questionnaire is perhaps the most extended autobiographical item in G\u00f6del's papers. G\u00f6del filled it out in pencil and wrote a cover letter, but he never returned it. \"Theistic\" is italicized in both Wang 1987 and Wang 1996. It is possible that this italicization is Wang's and not G\u00f6del's. The quote follows Wang 1987, with two corrections taken from Wang 1996. Wang 1987 reads \"Baptist Lutheran\" where Wang 1996 has \"baptized Lutheran\". Wang 1987 has \"rel. cong.\", which in Wang 1996 is expanded to \"religious congregation\".  Describing religion(s) in general, G\u00f6del said: \"Religions are, for the most part, bad\u2014but religion is not\".Wang 1996 p.\u00a0316 According to his wife Adele, \"G\u00f6del, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning\",Wang 1996, p.\u00a051. while of Islam, he said, \"I like Islam: it is a consistent [or consequential] idea of religion and open-minded.\"Wang 1996, p.\u00a0148, 4.4.3. It is one of G\u00f6del's observations, made between\n16 November and 7 December 1975, which Wang found hard to classify under the main topics considered elsewhere in the book.\n\nLegacy\nThe Kurt G\u00f6del Society, founded in 1987, was named in his honor. It is an international organization for the promotion of research in the areas of logic, philosophy, and the history of mathematics.  The University of Vienna hosts the Kurt G\u00f6del Research Center for Mathematical Logic. The Association for Symbolic Logic has invited an annual Kurt G\u00f6del lecturer each year since 1990.\nG\u00f6del's Philosophical Notebooks are edited at the Kurt G\u00f6del Research Centre which is situated at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Germany.  \n\nFive volumes of G\u00f6del's collected works have been published. The first two include G\u00f6del's publications; the third includes unpublished manuscripts from G\u00f6del's , and the final two include correspondence.\n\nA biography of G\u00f6del was published by John Dawson in 2005: Logical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt G\u00f6del (A. K. Peters, Wellesley, MA, ). G\u00f6del was also one of four mathematicians examined in the 2008 BBC documentary entitled Dangerous Knowledge by David Malone.\n\nDouglas Hofstadter wrote a popular book in 1979 called  to celebrate the work and ideas of G\u00f6del, along with those of artist M. C. Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach. The book partly explores the ramifications of the fact that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem can be applied to any Turing-complete computational system, which may include the human brain.\n\nBibliography\n\nImportant publications\nIn German:\n 1930, \"Die Vollst\u00e4ndigkeit der Axiome des logischen Funktionenkalk\u00fcls.\" Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik 37: 349\u201360.\n 1931, \"\u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I.\" Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik 38: 173\u201398.\n 1932, \"Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalk\u00fcl\", Anzeiger Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien 69: 65\u201366.\n\nIn English:\n 1940.

Many languages also provide short-circuit control structures corresponding to logical conjunction.\n\nLogical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations, where 0 corresponds to false and 1 to true:\n\n 0 AND 0 \u00a0=\u00a0 0,\n 0 AND 1 \u00a0=\u00a0 0,\n 1 AND 0 \u00a0=\u00a0 0,\n 1 AND 1 \u00a0=\u00a0 1.\n\nThe operation can also be applied to two binary words viewed as bitstrings of equal length, by taking the bitwise AND of each pair of bits at corresponding positions. For example:\n\n 11000110 AND 10100011 \u00a0=\u00a0 10000010.\n\nThis can be used to select part of a bitstring using a bit mask.  For example, 10011101 AND 00001000 \u00a0=\u00a0 00001000 extracts the fifth bit of an 8-bit bitstring.\n\nIn computer networking, bit masks are used to derive the network address of a subnet within an existing network from a given IP address, by ANDing the IP address and the subnet mask.\n\nLogical conjunction \"AND\" is also used in SQL operations to form database queries.\n\nThe Curry\u2013Howard correspondence relates logical conjunction to product types.\n\nSet-theoretic correspondence\nThe  membership of an element of an intersection set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical conjunction: x \u2208 A \u2229 B if and only if (x \u2208 A) \u2227 (x \u2208 B). Through this correspondence, set-theoretic intersection shares several properties with logical conjunction, such as associativity, commutativity, and idempotence.\n\nNatural language\nAs with other notions formalized in mathematical logic, the logical conjunction and is related to, but not the same as, the grammatical conjunction and in natural languages.\n\nEnglish \"and\" has properties not captured by logical conjunction.  For example, \"and\" sometimes implies order.  For example, \"They got married and had a child\" in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child.  The word \"and\" can also imply a partition of a thing into parts, as \"The American flag is red, white, and blue.\"   Here it is not meant that the flag is at once red, white, and blue, but rather that it has a part of each color.\n\nSee also\n\n And-inverter graph\n AND gate\n Bitwise AND\n Boolean algebra (logic)\n Boolean algebra topics\n Boolean conjunctive query\n Boolean domain\n Boolean function\n Boolean-valued function\n Conjunction introduction\n Conjunction elimination\n De Morgan's laws\n First-order logic\n Fr\u00e9chet inequalities\n Grammatical conjunction\n Logical disjunction\n Logical negation\n Logical graph\n Logical value\n Operation\n Peano\u2013Russell notation\n Propositional calculus\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \nWolfram MathWorld: Conjunction\n \n\nCategory:Logical connectives"}

His immediate work afterwards tilted towards commercial paintings, but thereafter he specialised in genre painting with romantic 18th century scenes and portraits or period characters or Pompeian scenes.

{"title": "Mathematical induction", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction", "text": "thumb|right|Mathematical induction can be informally illustrated by reference to the sequential effect of falling dominoes.Matt DeVos, Mathematical Induction, Simon Fraser UniversityGerardo con Diaz, Mathematical Induction, Harvard University\n\nMathematical induction is a mathematical proof technique. It is essentially used to prove that a property P(n) holds for every natural number n, i.e. for n\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0and so on.  Metaphors can be informally used to understand the concept of mathematical induction, such as the metaphor of falling dominoes or climbing a ladder:\n\nThe method of induction requires two cases to be proved. The first case, called the base case (or, sometimes, the basis), proves that the property holds for the number 0.  The second case, called the induction step, proves that, if the property holds for one natural number n, then it holds for the next natural number\u00a0n\u00a0+\u00a01.  These two steps establish the property P(n) for every natural number n\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0... The base step need not begin with zero.  Often it begins with the number one, and it can begin with any natural number, establishing the truth of the property for all natural numbers greater than or equal to the starting number.\n\nThe method can be extended to prove statements about more general well-founded structures, such as trees; this generalization, known as structural induction, is used in mathematical logic and computer science.  Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion. Mathematical induction, in some form, is the foundation of all correctness proofs for computer programs.\n\nAlthough its name may suggest otherwise, mathematical induction should not be misconstrued as a form of inductive reasoning as used in philosophy (also see Problem of induction). Mathematical induction is an inference rule used in formal proofs. Proofs by mathematical induction are, in fact, examples of deductive reasoning.\n\nHistory\nIn 370 BC, Plato's Parmenides may have contained an early example of an implicit inductive proof. The earliest implicit traces of mathematical induction may be found in Euclid's proof that the number of primes is infinite and in Bhaskara's \"cyclic method\". An opposite iterated technique, counting down rather than up, is found in the Sorites paradox, where it was argued that if 1,000,000 grains of sand formed a heap, and removing one grain from a heap left it a heap, then a single grain of sand (or even no grains) forms a heap.\n\nAn implicit proof by mathematical induction for arithmetic sequences was introduced in the al-Fakhri written by al-Karaji around 1000 AD,  who used it to prove the binomial theorem and properties of Pascal's triangle.Mathematical Knowledge and the Interplay of Practices \"The earliest implicit proof by mathematical induction was given around 1000 in a work by the Persian mathematician Al-Karaji\"\n\nNone of these ancient mathematicians, however, explicitly stated the induction hypothesis. Another similar case (contrary to what Vacca has written, as Freudenthal carefully showed) was that of Francesco Maurolico in his Arithmeticorum libri duo (1575), who used the technique to prove that the sum of the first n odd integers is n2. The first explicit formulation of the principle of induction was given by Pascal in his Trait\u00e9 du triangle arithm\u00e9tique (1665). Another Frenchman, Fermat, made ample use of a related principle, indirect proof by infinite descent. The induction hypothesis was also employed by the Swiss Jakob Bernoulli, and from then on it became more or less well known. The modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the principle came only in the 19th century, with George Boole,\"It is sometimes required to prove a theorem which shall be true whenever a certain quantity n which it involves shall be an integer or whole number and the method of proof is usually of the following kind. 1st. The theorem is proved to be true when\u00a0n\u00a0=\u00a01. 2ndly. It is proved that if the theorem is true when n is a given whole number, it will be true if n is the next greater integer. Hence the theorem is true universally. . .. This species of argument may be termed a continued sorites\" (Boole circa 1849 Elementary Treatise on Logic not mathematical pages 40\u201341 reprinted in Grattan-Guinness, Ivor and Bornet, G\u00e9rard (1997), George Boole: Selected Manuscripts on Logic and its Philosophy, Birkh\u00e4user Verlag, Berlin, ) Augustus de Morgan, Charles Sanders Peirce, Reprinted (CP\u00a03.252-88), (W\u00a04:299-309). Giuseppe Peano, and Richard Dedekind.\n\nDescription\nThe simplest and most common form of mathematical induction infers that a statement involving a natural number n holds for all values of n. The proof consists of two steps:\n The base case: prove that the statement holds for the first natural number n0. Usually, n0 = 0 or n0\u00a0=\u00a01; rarely, but sometimes conveniently, the base value of n0 may be taken as a larger number, or even as a negative number (the statement only holds at and above that threshold), because these extensions do not disturb the property of being a well-ordered set.\n The step case or inductive step: prove that for every n \u00a0\u2265\u00a0 n0, if the statement holds for n, then it holds for n\u00a0+\u00a01. In other words, assume the statement holds for some arbitrary natural number n \u00a0\u2265\u00a0 n0, and prove that then the statement holds for n\u00a0+\u00a01.\n\nThe hypothesis in the inductive step, that the statement holds for some n, is called the induction hypothesis or inductive hypothesis. To prove the inductive step, one assumes the induction hypothesis and then uses this assumption, involving n, to prove the statement for n\u00a0+\u00a01.\n\nWhether n\u00a0=\u00a00 or n\u00a0=\u00a01 is taken as the standard base case depends on the preferred definition of the natural numbers. In the fields of combinatorics and mathematical logic it is common to consider 0 as a natural number.\n\nExample\nMathematical induction can be used to prove that the following statement, P(n), holds for all natural numbers n.\n\nP(n) gives a formula for the sum of the natural numbers less than or equal to number n. The proof that P(n) is true for each natural number n proceeds as follows.\n\nBase case: Show that the statement holds for n = 0 (taking 0 as a natural).\n\nP(0) is easily seen to be true:\n\nInductive step: Show that if P(k) holds, then also  holds. This can be done as follows.\n\nAssume P(k) holds (for some unspecified value of k). It must then be shown that  holds, that is:\n\nUsing the induction hypothesis that P(k) holds, the left-hand side can be rewritten to:\n\nAlgebraically:\n \n\nthereby showing that indeed   holds.\n\nSince both the base case and the inductive step have been performed, by mathematical induction the statement P(n) holds for all natural numbers n. Q.E.D.\n\nVariants\n\nIn practice, proofs by induction are often structured differently, depending on the exact nature of the property to be proven.\n\nInduction basis other than 0 or 1\nIf one wishes to prove a statement not for all natural numbers but only for all numbers n greater than or equal to a certain number b, then the proof by induction consists of:\n Showing that the statement holds when n\u00a0=\u00a0b.\n Showing that if the statement holds for some n\u00a0\u2265\u00a0b then the same statement also holds for\u00a0n\u00a0+\u00a01.\nThis can be used, for example, to show that  for\u00a0n\u00a0\u2265\u00a03.\n\nIn this way, one can prove that some statement P(n) holds for all n \u2265 1, or even n \u2265 \u22125.  This form of mathematical induction is actually a special case of the previous form, because if the statement to be proved is P(n) then proving it with these two rules is equivalent with proving P(n\u00a0+\u00a0b) for all natural numbers n with an induction base case 0.Ted Sundstrom, Mathematical Reasoning, p. 190, Pearson, 2006, \n\n Example: forming dollar amounts by coins \nAssume an infinite supply of 4- and 5-dollar coins. Induction can be used to prove that any whole amount of dollars greater than or equal to  can be formed by a combination of such coins. The amount  is chosen to begin on  as the statement does not hold true for every lower number; in particular, it is violated for .\n\nIn more precise terms, we wish to show that for any amount  there exist natural numbers  such that , where 0 is included as a natural number. The statement to be shown is thus:\n\nBase case: Showing that  holds for  is trivial: let  and . Then, .\n\nStep case: Given that  holds for some value of  (induction hypothesis), prove that  holds, too. That is, given that  for some natural numbers , prove that there exist natural numbers  such that .\n\nHere we need to consider two cases.\n\nFor the first case, assume that . By some algebraic manipulation and by assumption, we see that in that case\n\n \n\nwhere  and  are natural numbers.\n\nThis shows that to add  to the total amount\u2014any amount whatsoever, so long as it is greater than \u2014it is sufficient to remove a single 4-dollar coin while adding a 5-dollar coin. However, this construction fails in the case that , or in words, when there is no 4-dollar coin. \n\nSo it remains to prove the case . Then , which implies that .\n\n \n\nwhere  and  are again natural numbers.\n\nThe above calculation shows that in the case there are no 4-dollar coins, we can add  to the amount by removing three 5-dollar coins while adding four 4-dollar coins.\n\nThus, with the inductive step, we have shown that  implies  for all natural numbers , and the proof is complete. Q.E.D.\n\nThis proof cannot be modified to replace the minimum amount of  dollar to any lower value :\nfor , the base case is not provable, since there is no way to get  dollar by 4- and 5-dollar coins only;\nfor , the second case in the induction step will not work any longer, since  will not imply ;\nlet alone for even lower .\n\nInduction on more than one counter\nIt is sometimes desirable to prove a statement involving two natural numbers, n and m, by iterating the induction process. That is, one proves a base case and an inductive step for n, and in each of those proves a base case and an inductive step for m. See, for example, the proof of commutativity accompanying addition of natural numbers. More complicated arguments involving three or more counters are also possible.\n\nInfinite descent\n\nThe method of infinite descent is a variation of mathematical induction which was used by Pierre de Fermat. It is used to show that some statement Q(n) is false for all natural numbers n. Its traditional form consists of showing that if Q(n) is true for some natural number n, it also holds for some strictly smaller natural number m. Because there are no infinite decreasing sequences of natural numbers, this situation would be impossible, showing by contradiction that Q(n) cannot be true for any n. \n\nThe validity of this method can be verified from the usual principle of mathematical induction.  Using mathematical induction on the statement P(n) defined as \"Q(m) is false for all natural numbers m less than or equal to n\", it follows that P(n) holds for all n, which means that Q(n) is false for every natural number n.\n\nPrefix induction\nThe most common form of proof by mathematical induction requires proving in the inductive step that\n\nwhereupon the induction principle \"automates\" n applications of this step in getting from P(0) to P(n).  This could be called \"predecessor induction\" because each step proves something about a number from something about that number's predecessor.\n\nA variant of interest in computational complexity is \"prefix induction\", in which one needs to prove\n\nor equivalently\n\nThe induction principle then \"automates\" log n applications of this inference in getting from P(0) to P(n).  (It is called \"prefix induction\" because each step proves something about a number from something about the \"prefix\" of that number formed by truncating the low bit of its binary representation. It can be viewed as an application of traditional induction on the length of that binary representation.)\n\nIf traditional predecessor induction is interpreted computationally as an n-step loop, prefix induction corresponds to a log n-step loop, and thus proofs using prefix induction are \"more feasibly constructive\" than proofs using predecessor induction.\n\nPredecessor induction can trivially simulate prefix induction on the same statement.  Prefix induction can simulate predecessor induction, but only at the cost of making the statement more syntactically complex (adding a bounded universal quantifier), so the interesting results relating prefix induction to polynomial-time computation depend on excluding unbounded quantifiers entirely, and limiting the alternation of bounded universal and existential quantifiers allowed in the statement.\n\nOne can take the idea a step further: one must prove\n\nwhereupon the induction principle \"automates\" log log n applications of this inference in getting from P(0) to P(n).  This form of induction has been used, analogously, to study log-time parallel computation.\n\nComplete (strong) induction\nAnother variant, called complete induction, course of values induction or strong induction (in contrast to which the basic form of induction is sometimes known as weak induction) makes the inductive step easier to prove by using a stronger hypothesis: one proves the statement  under the assumption that P(n) holds for all natural n less than ; by contrast, the basic form only assumes P(m). The name \"strong induction\" does not mean that this method can prove more than \"weak induction\", but merely refers to the stronger hypothesis used in the inductive step; in fact the two methods are equivalent, as explained below. In this form of complete induction one still has to prove the base case, P(0), and it may even be necessary to prove extra base cases such as P(1) before the general argument applies, as in the example below of the Fibonacci number Fn.\n\nAlthough the form just described requires one to prove the base case, this is unnecessary if one can prove P(m) (assuming P(n) for all lower n) for all . This is a special case of transfinite induction as described below. In this form the base case is subsumed by the case , where P(0) is proved with no other P(n) assumed;\nthis case may need to be handled separately, but sometimes the same argument applies for m\u00a0=\u00a00 and , making the proof simpler and more elegant.\nIn this method it is, however, vital to ensure that the proof of P(m) does not implicitly assume that , e.g. by saying \"choose an arbitrary \" or assuming that a set of m elements has an element.\n\nComplete induction is equivalent to ordinary mathematical induction as described above, in the sense that a proof by one method can be transformed into a proof by the other. Suppose there is a proof of P(n) by complete induction. Let Q(n) mean \"P(m) holds for all m such that \".  Then Q(n) holds for all n if and only if P(n) holds for all n, and our proof of P(n) is easily transformed into a proof of Q(n) by (ordinary) induction. If, on the other hand, P(n) had been proven by ordinary induction, the proof would already effectively be one by complete induction: P(0) is proved in the base case, using no assumptions, and  is proved in the inductive step, in which one may assume all earlier cases but need only use the case P(n).\n\nExample: Fibonacci numbers\nComplete induction is most useful when several instances of the inductive hypothesis are required for each inductive step.  For example, complete induction can be used to show that\n\nwhere Fn is the nth Fibonacci number,  (the golden ratio) and  are the roots of the polynomial . By using the fact that  for each , the identity above can be verified by direct calculation for  if one assumes that it already holds for both Fn+1 and Fn. To complete the proof, the identity must be verified in the two base cases  and .\n\nExample: prime factorization\nAnother proof by complete induction uses the hypothesis that the statement holds for all smaller n more thoroughly.  Consider the statement that \"every natural number greater than 1 is a product of (one or more) prime numbers\", which is the \"existence\" part of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. For proving the inductive step, the induction hypothesis is that for a given  the statement holds for all smaller .  If m is prime then it is certainly a product of primes, and if not, then by definition it is a product: , where neither of the factors is equal to 1; hence neither is equal to m, and so both are smaller than m.  The induction hypothesis now applies to n1 and n2, so each one is a product of primes.  Thus m is a product of products of primes; therefore itself a product of primes.\n\n Example: dollar amounts revisited \nWe shall look to prove the same example as above, this time with a variant called strong induction. The statement remains the same:\n\nHowever, there will be slight differences with the structure and assumptions of the proof. Let us begin with the base case.\n\nBase case: Show that  holds for .\n\n \n\nThe base case holds.\n\nInduction hypothesis: Given some  such that  holds for all  with .\n\nInductive step: Prove that  holds.\n\nChoosing , and observing that  shows that  holds, by inductive hypothesis. That is, the sum  can be formed by some combination of  and  dollar coins. Then, simply adding a  dollar coin to that combination yields the sum . That is,  holds. Q.E.D.\nForward-backward induction\nSometimes it is more convenient to deduct backwards, proving the statement for , given its validity for . However, proving the validity of the statement for no single number suffices to establish the base case; instead, one needs to prove the statement for an infinite subset of the natural numbers. For example, Augustin Louis Cauchy first used forward (regular) induction to prove the\ninequality of arithmetic and geometric means for all powers of 2, and then used backward induction to show it for all natural numbers.Cauchy, Augustin-Louis (1821). Cours d'analyse de l'\u00c9cole Royale Polytechnique, premi\u00e8re partie, Analyse alg\u00e9brique,  Paris. The proof of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means can be found on pages 457ff.\n\nExample of error in the inductive step\n\nThe inductive step must be proved for all values of n. To illustrate this, Joel E. Cohen proposed the following argument, which purports to prove by mathematical induction that all horses are of the same color:. Reprinted in A Random Walk in Science (R. L. Weber, ed.), Crane, Russak & Co., 1973.\nBase case: In a set of only one horse, there is only one color.\nInductive step: Assume as induction hypothesis that within any set of n horses, there is only one color.  Now look at any set of n\u00a0+\u00a01 horses.  Number them: 1, 2, 3, ..., n, n\u00a0+\u00a01.  Consider the sets {1, 2, 3, ..., n} and {2, 3, 4, ..., n\u00a0+\u00a01}.  Each is a set of only n horses, therefore within each there is only one color.  But the two sets overlap, so there must be only one color among all n\u00a0+\u00a01 horses.\n\nThe base case n\u00a0=\u00a01 is trivial (as any horse is the same color as itself), and the inductive step is correct in all cases n\u00a0>\u00a01. However, the logic of the inductive step is incorrect for n\u00a0=\u00a01, because the statement that \"the two sets overlap\" is false (there are only n\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a0=\u00a02 horses prior to either removal, and after removal the sets of one horse each do not overlap).\n\nFormalization\n\nIn second-order logic, we can write down the \"axiom of induction\" as follows:\n ,\nwhere P(.) is a variable for predicates involving one natural number and k and n are variables for natural numbers.\n\nIn words, the base case P(0) and the inductive step (namely, that the induction hypothesis P(k) implies P(k\u00a0+\u00a01)) together imply that P(n) for any natural number n. The axiom of induction asserts the validity of inferring that P(n) holds for any natural number n from the base case and the inductive step.\n\nNote that the first quantifier in the axiom ranges over predicates rather than over individual numbers.  This is a second-order quantifier, which means that this axiom is stated in second-order logic.  Axiomatizing arithmetic induction in first-order logic requires an axiom schema containing a separate axiom for each possible predicate.  The article Peano axioms contains further discussion of this issue.\n\nThe axiom of structural induction for the natural numbers was first formulated by Peano, who used it to specify the natural numbers together with four other axioms saying that (1) 0 is a natural number, (2) the successor function s of every natural number yields a natural number (s(x)=x+1), (3) the successor function is injective, and (4) 0 is not in the range of s.\n\nIn first-order ZFC set theory, quantification over predicates is not allowed, but we can still phrase induction by quantification over sets:\n \n may be read as a set representing a proposition, and containing natural numbers, for which the proposition holds. This is not an axiom, but a theorem, given that natural numbers are defined in the language of ZFC set theory by axioms, analogous to Peano's.\n\nTransfinite induction\n\nThe principle of complete induction is not only valid for statements about natural numbers, but for statements about elements of any well-founded set, that is, a set with an irreflexive relation < that contains no infinite descending chains. Any set of cardinal numbers is well-founded, which includes the set of natural numbers.\n\nApplied to a well-founded set, it can be formulated as a single step:\n Show that if some statement holds for all , then the same statement also holds for n.\n\nThis form of induction, when applied to a set of ordinals (which form a well-ordered and hence well-founded class), is called transfinite induction. It is an important proof technique in set theory, topology and other fields.\n\nProofs by transfinite induction typically distinguish three cases:\n when n is a minimal element, i.e. there is no element smaller than n;\n when n has a direct predecessor, i.e. the set of elements which are smaller than n has a largest element;\n when n has no direct predecessor, i.e. n is a so-called limit ordinal.\n\nStrictly speaking, it is not necessary in transfinite induction to prove a base case, because it is a vacuous special case of the proposition that if P is true of all , then P is true of m.  It is vacuously true precisely because there are no values of  that could serve as counterexamples. So the special cases are special cases of the general case.\n\n Equivalence with the well-ordering principle \nThe principle of mathematical induction is usually stated as an axiom of the natural numbers; see Peano axioms.  However, it can be proved from the well-ordering principle.  Indeed, suppose the following:\n The set of natural numbers is well-ordered.\n Every natural number is either 0, or  for some natural .\n For any natural number n,  is greater .\n\nTo derive simple induction from these axioms, one must show that if P(n) is some proposition predicated of n for which:\n P(0) holds and\n whenever P(m) is true then ) is also true,\nthen P(n) holds for all n.\n\nProof. Let S be the set of all natural numbers for which P(m) is false.  Let us see what happens if one asserts that S is nonempty.  Well-ordering tells us that S has a least element, say n.  Moreover, since P(0) is true, n is not 0.  Since every natural number is either 0 or some , there is some natural number m such that .  Now m is less than n, and n is the least element of S.  It follows that m is not in S, and so P(m) is true.  This means that ) is true; in other words, P(n) is true.  This is a contradiction, since n was in S.  Therefore, S is empty.\n\nIt can also be proved that induction, given the other axioms, implies the well-ordering principle.\n\nProof. Suppose there exists a non-empty set, S, of naturals that has no least element. Let P(n) be the assertion that n is not in S. Then P(0) is true, for if it were false then 0 is the least element of S. Furthermore, suppose P(1), P(2),..., P(n) are all true. Then if P(n+1) is false n+1 is in S, thus being a minimal element in S, a contradiction. Thus P(n+1) is true. Therefore, by the induction axiom, P(n) holds for all n, so S is empty, a contradiction.\n\nSee also\nCombinatorial proof\nRecursion\nRecursion (computer science)\nStructural induction\nProof by exhaustion\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nIntroduction\n  (Ch. 8.)\n \n \n  (Section 1.2.1: Mathematical Induction, pp.\u00a011\u201321.)\n  (Section 3.8: Transfinite induction, pp.\u00a028\u201329.)\n\nHistory\n \n \n \n \n \n Katz, Victor J.

{"title": "Mathematical logic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic", "text": "Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics.  It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science.Undergraduate texts include Boolos, Burgess, and Jeffrey (2002), Enderton (2001), and Mendelson (1997). A classic graduate text by Shoenfield (2001) first appeared in 1967.  The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems.\n \nMathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory.  These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those.\n\nSince its inception, mathematical logic has both contributed to, and has been motivated by, the study of foundations of mathematics. This study began in the late 19th century with the development of axiomatic frameworks for geometry, arithmetic, and analysis. In the early 20th century it was shaped by David Hilbert's program to prove the consistency of foundational theories. Results of Kurt G\u00f6del, Gerhard Gentzen, and others provided partial resolution to the program, and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency. Work in set theory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of sets, although there are some theorems that cannot be proven in common axiom systems for set theory. Contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics often focuses on establishing which parts of mathematics can be formalized in particular formal systems (as in reverse mathematics) rather than trying to find theories in which all of mathematics can be developed.\n\nSubfields and scope\n\nThe Handbook of Mathematical Logic  makes a rough division of contemporary mathematical logic into four areas:\nset theory\nmodel theory\nrecursion theory, and\nproof theory and constructive mathematics (considered as parts of a single area).\nEach area has a distinct focus, although many techniques and results are shared among multiple areas. The borderlines amongst these fields, and the lines separating mathematical logic and other fields of mathematics, are not always sharp.  G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem marks not only a milestone in recursion theory and proof theory, but has also led to L\u00f6b's theorem in modal logic. The method of forcing is employed in set theory, model theory, and recursion theory, as well as in the study of intuitionistic mathematics.\n\nThe mathematical field of category theory uses many formal axiomatic methods, and includes the study of categorical logic, but category theory is not ordinarily considered a subfield of mathematical logic. Because of its applicability in diverse fields of mathematics, mathematicians including Saunders Mac Lane have proposed category theory as a foundational system for mathematics, independent of set theory. These foundations use toposes, which resemble generalized models of set theory that may employ classical or nonclassical logic.\n\nHistory\nMathematical logic emerged in the mid-19th century as a subfield of mathematics, reflecting the confluence of two traditions: formal philosophical logic and mathematics (Ferreir\u00f3s 2001, p.\u00a0443).  \"Mathematical logic, also called  'logistic', 'symbolic logic', the 'algebra of logic', and, more recently, simply 'formal logic', is the set of logical theories elaborated in the course of the last [nineteenth] century with the aid of an artificial notation and a rigorously deductive method.\"Jozef Maria Bochenski, A Precis of Mathematical Logic (1959), rev. and trans., Albert Menne, ed. and trans., Otto Bird, Dordrecht, South Holland:  Reidel, Sec. 0.1, p. 1.  Before this emergence, logic was studied with rhetoric, with calculationes,Richard Swineshead (1498), Calculationes Suiseth Anglici, Papie: Per Franciscum Gyrardengum. through the syllogism, and with philosophy.  The first half of the 20th century saw an explosion of fundamental results, accompanied by vigorous debate over the foundations of mathematics.\n\n Early history \n\nTheories of logic were developed in many cultures in history, including China, India, Greece and the Islamic world. In 18th-century Europe, attempts to treat the operations of formal logic in a symbolic or algebraic way had been made by philosophical mathematicians including Leibniz and Lambert, but their labors remained isolated and little known.\n\n 19th century \n\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, George Boole and then Augustus De Morgan presented systematic mathematical treatments of logic.  Their work, building on work by algebraists such as George Peacock, extended the traditional Aristotelian doctrine of logic into a sufficient framework for the study of foundations of mathematics\u00a0(Katz 1998, p.\u00a0686).\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce built upon the work of Boole to develop a logical system for relations and quantifiers, which he published in several papers from 1870 to 1885.\nGottlob Frege presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his Begriffsschrift, published in 1879, a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic. Frege's work remained obscure, however, until Bertrand Russell began to promote it near the turn of the century.  The two-dimensional notation Frege developed was never widely adopted and is unused in contemporary texts.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1905, Ernst Schr\u00f6der published Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik in three volumes. This work summarized and extended the work of Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce, and was a comprehensive reference to symbolic logic as it was understood at the end of the 19th century.\n\n Foundational theories \n\nConcerns that mathematics had not been built on a proper foundation led to the development of axiomatic systems for fundamental areas of mathematics such as arithmetic, analysis, and geometry.\n\nIn logic, the term arithmetic refers to the theory of the natural numbers. Giuseppe Peano (1889) published a set of axioms for arithmetic that came to bear his name (Peano axioms), using a variation of the logical system of Boole and Schr\u00f6der but adding quantifiers. Peano was unaware of Frege's work at the time. Around the same time Richard Dedekind showed that the natural numbers are uniquely characterized by their induction properties. Dedekind (1888) proposed a different characterization, which lacked the formal logical character of Peano's axioms. Dedekind's work, however, proved theorems inaccessible in Peano's system, including the uniqueness of the set of natural numbers (up to isomorphism) and the  recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the successor function and mathematical induction.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, flaws in Euclid's axioms for geometry became known (Katz 1998, p.\u00a0774).  In addition to the independence of the parallel postulate, established by Nikolai Lobachevsky in 1826 (Lobachevsky 1840), mathematicians discovered that certain theorems taken for granted by Euclid were not in fact provable from his axioms. Among these is the theorem that a line contains at least two points, or that circles of the same radius whose centers are separated by that radius must intersect. Hilbert (1899) developed a complete set of axioms for geometry, building on previous work by Pasch (1882).  The success in axiomatizing geometry motivated Hilbert to seek complete axiomatizations of other areas of mathematics, such as the natural numbers and the real line.  This would prove to be a major area of research in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nThe 19th century saw great advances in the theory of real analysis, including theories of convergence of functions and Fourier series. Mathematicians such as Karl Weierstrass began to construct functions that stretched intuition, such as nowhere-differentiable continuous functions. Previous conceptions of a function as a rule for computation, or a smooth graph, were no longer adequate.  Weierstrass began to advocate the arithmetization of analysis, which sought to axiomatize analysis using properties of the natural numbers. The modern (\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit and continuous functions was already developed by Bolzano in 1817 (Felscher 2000), but remained relatively unknown.\nCauchy in 1821 defined continuity in terms of infinitesimals (see Cours d'Analyse, page 34).  In 1858, Dedekind proposed a definition of the real numbers in terms of Dedekind cuts of rational numbers (Dedekind 1872), a definition still employed in contemporary texts.\n\nGeorg Cantor developed the fundamental concepts of infinite set theory. His early results developed the theory of cardinality and proved that the reals and the natural numbers have different cardinalities (Cantor 1874). Over the next twenty years, Cantor developed a theory of transfinite numbers in a series of publications. In 1891, he published a new proof of the uncountability of the real numbers that introduced the diagonal argument, and used this method to prove Cantor's theorem that no set can have the same cardinality as its powerset. Cantor believed that every set could be well-ordered, but was unable to produce a proof for this result, leaving it as an open problem in 1895 (Katz 1998, p.\u00a0807).\n\n 20th century \nIn the early decades of the 20th century, the main areas of study were set theory and formal logic. The discovery of paradoxes in informal set theory caused some to wonder whether mathematics itself is inconsistent, and to look for proofs of consistency.\n\nIn 1900, Hilbert posed a famous list of 23 problems for the next century. The first two of these were to resolve the continuum hypothesis and prove the consistency of elementary arithmetic, respectively; the tenth was to produce a method that could decide whether a multivariate polynomial equation over the integers has a solution. Subsequent work to resolve these problems shaped the direction of mathematical logic, as did the effort to resolve Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem, posed in 1928. This problem asked for a procedure that would decide, given a formalized mathematical statement, whether the statement is true or false.\n\n Set theory and paradoxes \n\nErnst Zermelo (1904) gave a proof that every set could be well-ordered, a result Georg Cantor had been unable to obtain. To achieve the proof, Zermelo introduced the axiom of choice, which drew heated debate and research among mathematicians and the pioneers of set theory. The immediate criticism of the method led Zermelo to publish a second exposition of his result, directly addressing criticisms of his proof (Zermelo 1908a). This paper led to the general acceptance of the axiom of choice in the mathematics community.\n\nSkepticism about the axiom of choice was reinforced by recently discovered paradoxes in naive set theory. Cesare Burali-Forti (1897) was the first to state a paradox: the Burali-Forti paradox shows that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot form a set. Very soon thereafter, Bertrand Russell discovered Russell's paradox in 1901, and Jules Richard (1905) discovered Richard's paradox.\n\nZermelo (1908b) provided the first set of axioms for set theory. These axioms, together with the additional axiom of replacement proposed by Abraham Fraenkel, are now called Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZF). Zermelo's axioms incorporated the principle of limitation of size to avoid Russell's paradox.\n\nIn 1910, the first volume of Principia Mathematica by Russell and Alfred North Whitehead was published. This seminal work developed the theory of functions and cardinality in a completely formal framework of type theory, which Russell and Whitehead developed in an effort to avoid the paradoxes. Principia Mathematica is considered one of the most influential works of the 20th century, although the framework of type theory did not prove popular as a foundational theory for mathematics (Ferreir\u00f3s 2001, p.\u00a0445).\n\nFraenkel (1922) proved that the axiom of choice cannot be proved from the axioms of Zermelo's set theory with urelements. Later work by Paul Cohen (1966) showed that the addition of urelements is not needed, and the axiom of choice is unprovable in ZF. Cohen's proof developed the method of forcing, which is now an important tool for establishing independence results in set theory.See also .\n\n Symbolic logic \n\nLeopold L\u00f6wenheim (1915) and Thoralf Skolem (1920) obtained the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, which says that first-order logic cannot control the cardinalities of infinite structures. Skolem realized that this theorem would apply to first-order formalizations of set theory, and that it implies any such formalization has a countable model. This counterintuitive fact became known as Skolem's paradox.\n\nIn his doctoral thesis, Kurt G\u00f6del (1929) proved the completeness theorem, which establishes a correspondence between syntax and semantics in first-order logic. G\u00f6del used the completeness theorem to prove the compactness theorem, demonstrating the finitary nature of first-order logical consequence. These results helped establish first-order logic as the dominant logic used by mathematicians.\n\nIn 1931, G\u00f6del published On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems, which proved the incompleteness (in a different meaning of the word) of all sufficiently strong, effective first-order theories. This result, known as G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem, establishes severe limitations on axiomatic foundations for mathematics, striking a strong blow to Hilbert's program. It showed the impossibility of providing a consistency proof of arithmetic within any formal theory of arithmetic.  Hilbert, however, did not acknowledge the importance of the incompleteness theorem for some time.In the foreword to the 1934 first edition of \"Grundlagen der Mathematik\" , Bernays wrote the following, which is reminiscent of the famous note by Frege when informed of Russell's paradox.\"Die Ausf\u00fchrung dieses Vorhabens hat eine wesentliche Verz\u00f6gerung dadurch erfahren, da\u00df in einem Stadium, in dem die Darstellung schon ihrem Abschu\u00df nahe war, durch das Erscheinen der Arbeiten von Herbrand und von G\u00f6del eine ver\u00e4nderte Situation im Gebiet der Beweistheorie entstand, welche die Ber\u00fccksichtigung neuer Einsichten zur Aufgabe machte. Dabei ist der Umfang des Buches angewachsen, so da\u00df eine Teilung in zwei B\u00e4nde angezeigt erschien.\" Translation: \"Carrying out this plan [by Hilbert for an exposition on proof theory for mathematical logic] has experienced an essential delay because, at the stage at which the exposition was already near to its conclusion, there occurred an altered situation in the area of proof theory due to the appearance of works by Herbrand and G\u00f6del, which necessitated the consideration of new insights. Thus the scope of this book has grown, so that a division into two volumes seemed advisable.\" So certainly Hilbert was aware of the importance of G\u00f6del's work by 1934. The second volume in 1939 included a form of Gentzen's consistency proof for arithmetic.\n\nG\u00f6del's theorem shows that a consistency proof of any sufficiently strong, effective axiom system cannot be obtained in the system itself, if the system is consistent, nor in any weaker system. This leaves open the possibility of consistency proofs that cannot be formalized within the system they consider. Gentzen (1936) proved the consistency of arithmetic using a finitistic system together with a principle of transfinite induction. Gentzen's result introduced the ideas of cut elimination and proof-theoretic ordinals, which became key tools in proof theory.  G\u00f6del (1958) gave a different consistency proof, which reduces the consistency of classical arithmetic to that of intuitionistic arithmetic in higher types.\n\nBeginnings of the other branches\n\nAlfred Tarski developed the basics of model theory.\n\nBeginning in 1935, a group of prominent mathematicians collaborated under the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki to publish a series of encyclopedic mathematics texts. These texts, written in an austere and axiomatic style, emphasized rigorous presentation and set-theoretic foundations. Terminology coined by these texts, such as the words bijection, injection, and surjection, and the set-theoretic foundations the texts employed, were widely adopted throughout mathematics.\n\nThe study of computability came to be known as recursion theory, because early formalizations by G\u00f6del and Kleene relied on recursive definitions of functions.A detailed study of this terminology is given by Soare (1996). When these definitions were shown equivalent to Turing's formalization involving Turing machines, it became clear that a new concept \u2013 the computable function \u2013 had been discovered, and that this definition was robust enough to admit numerous independent characterizations. In his work on the incompleteness theorems in 1931, G\u00f6del lacked a rigorous concept of an effective formal system; he immediately realized that the new definitions of computability could be used for this purpose, allowing him to state the incompleteness theorems in generality that could only be implied in the original paper.\n\nNumerous results in recursion theory were obtained in the 1940s by Stephen Cole Kleene and Emil Leon Post. Kleene (1943) introduced the concepts of relative computability, foreshadowed by Turing (1939), and the arithmetical hierarchy. Kleene later generalized recursion theory to higher-order functionals. Kleene and Kreisel studied formal versions of intuitionistic mathematics, particularly in the context of proof theory.\n\n Formal logical systems  \n\nAt its core, mathematical logic deals with mathematical concepts expressed using formal logical systems. These systems, though they differ in many details, share the common property of considering only expressions in a fixed formal language.  The systems of propositional logic and first-order logic are the most widely studied today, because of their applicability to foundations of mathematics and because of their desirable proof-theoretic properties.Ferreir\u00f3s (2001) surveys the rise of first-order logic over other formal logics in the early 20th century.  Stronger classical logics such as second-order logic or infinitary logic are also studied, along with nonclassical logics such as intuitionistic logic.\n\n First-order logic \n\nFirst-order logic is a particular formal system of logic. Its syntax involves only finite expressions as well-formed formulas, while its semantics are characterized by the limitation of all quantifiers to a fixed domain of discourse.\n\nEarly results from formal logic established limitations of first-order logic. The L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem (1919) showed that if a set of sentences in a countable first-order language has an infinite model then it has at least one model of each infinite cardinality. This shows that it is impossible for a set of first-order axioms to characterize the natural numbers, the real numbers, or any other infinite structure up to isomorphism. As the goal of early foundational studies was to produce axiomatic theories for all parts of mathematics, this limitation was particularly stark.\n\nG\u00f6del's completeness theorem (G\u00f6del 1929) established the equivalence between semantic and syntactic definitions of logical consequence in first-order logic. It shows that if a particular sentence is true in every model that satisfies a particular set of axioms, then there must be a finite deduction of the sentence from the axioms. The compactness theorem first appeared as a lemma in G\u00f6del's proof of the completeness theorem, and it took many years before logicians grasped its significance and began to apply it routinely. It says that a set of sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset has a model, or in other words that an inconsistent set of formulas must have a finite inconsistent subset. The completeness and compactness theorems allow for sophisticated analysis of logical consequence in first-order logic and the development of model theory, and they are a key reason for the prominence of first-order logic in mathematics.\n\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems (G\u00f6del 1931) establish additional limits on first-order axiomatizations. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any consistent, effectively given (defined below) logical system that is capable of interpreting arithmetic, there exists a statement that is true (in the sense that it holds for the natural numbers) but not provable within that logical system (and which indeed may fail in some non-standard models of arithmetic which may be consistent with the logical system). For example, in every logical system capable of expressing the Peano axioms, the G\u00f6del sentence holds for the natural numbers but cannot be proved.\n\nHere a logical system is said to be effectively given if it is possible to decide, given any formula in the language of the system, whether the formula is an axiom, and one which can express the Peano axioms is called \"sufficiently strong.\" When applied to first-order logic, the first incompleteness theorem implies that any sufficiently strong, consistent, effective first-order theory has models that are not elementarily equivalent, a stronger limitation than the one established by the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem. The second incompleteness theorem states that no sufficiently strong, consistent, effective axiom system for arithmetic can prove its own consistency, which has been interpreted to show that Hilbert's program cannot be completed.\n\n Other classical logics \n\nMany logics besides first-order logic are studied.  These include infinitary logics, which allow for formulas to provide an infinite amount of information, and higher-order logics, which include a portion of set theory directly in their semantics.\n\nThe most well studied infinitary logic is . In this logic, quantifiers may only be nested to finite depths, as in first-order logic, but formulas may have finite or countably infinite conjunctions and disjunctions within them. Thus, for example, it is possible to say that an object is a whole number using a formula of  such as\n\nHigher-order logics allow for quantification not only of elements of the domain of discourse, but subsets of the domain of discourse, sets of such subsets, and other objects of higher type. The semantics are defined so that, rather than having a separate domain for each higher-type quantifier to range over, the quantifiers instead range over all objects of the appropriate type.  The logics studied before the development of first-order logic, for example Frege's logic, had similar set-theoretic aspects. Although higher-order logics are more expressive, allowing complete axiomatizations of structures such as the natural numbers, they do not satisfy analogues of the completeness and compactness theorems from first-order logic, and are thus less amenable to proof-theoretic analysis.\n\nAnother type of logics are s that allow inductive definitions, like one writes for primitive recursive functions.\n\nOne can formally define an extension of first-order logic \u2014 a notion which encompasses all logics in this section because they behave like first-order logic in certain fundamental ways, but does not encompass all logics in general, e.g. it does not encompass intuitionistic, modal or fuzzy logic. Lindstr\u00f6m's theorem implies that the only extension of first-order logic satisfying both the compactness theorem and the Downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem is first-order logic.\n\n Nonclassical and modal logic \n\nModal logics include additional modal operators, such as an operator which states that a particular formula is not only true, but necessarily true. Although modal logic is not often used to axiomatize mathematics, it has been used to study the properties of first-order provability (Solovay 1976) and set-theoretic forcing (Hamkins and L\u00f6we 2007).\n\nIntuitionistic logic was developed by Heyting to study Brouwer's program of intuitionism, in which Brouwer himself avoided formalization. Intuitionistic logic specifically does not include the law of the excluded middle, which states that each sentence is either true or its negation is true.  Kleene's work with the proof theory of intuitionistic logic showed that constructive information can be recovered from intuitionistic proofs. For example, any provably total function in intuitionistic arithmetic is computable; this is not true in classical theories of arithmetic such as Peano arithmetic.\n\n Algebraic logic \n\nAlgebraic logic uses the methods of abstract algebra to study the semantics of formal logics. A fundamental example is the use of Boolean algebras to represent truth values in classical propositional logic, and the use of Heyting algebras to represent truth values in intuitionistic propositional logic. Stronger logics, such as first-order logic and higher-order logic, are studied using more complicated algebraic structures such as cylindric algebras.\n\n Set theory \n\nSet theory is the study of sets, which are abstract collections of objects. Many of the basic notions, such as ordinal and cardinal numbers, were developed informally by Cantor before formal axiomatizations of set theory were developed. The first such axiomatization, due to Zermelo (1908b), was extended slightly to become Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZF), which is now the most widely used foundational theory for mathematics.\n\nOther formalizations of set theory have been proposed, including von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory (NBG), Morse\u2013Kelley set theory (MK), and New Foundations (NF).  Of these, ZF, NBG, and MK are similar in describing a cumulative hierarchy of sets. New Foundations takes a different approach; it allows objects such as the set of all sets at the cost of restrictions on its set-existence axioms. The system of Kripke\u2013Platek set theory is closely related to generalized recursion theory.\n\nTwo famous statements in set theory are the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis. The axiom of choice, first stated by Zermelo (1904), was proved independent of ZF by Fraenkel (1922), but has come to be widely accepted by mathematicians.  It states that given a collection of nonempty sets there is a single set C that contains exactly one element from each set in the collection. The set C is said to \"choose\" one element from each set in the collection. While the ability to make such a choice is considered obvious by some, since each set in the collection is nonempty, the lack of a general, concrete rule by which the choice can be made renders the axiom nonconstructive. Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski (1924) showed that the axiom of choice can be used to decompose a solid ball into a finite number of pieces which can then be rearranged, with no scaling, to make two solid balls of the original size. This theorem, known as the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox, is one of many counterintuitive results of the axiom of choice.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis, first proposed as a conjecture by Cantor, was listed by David Hilbert as one of his 23 problems in 1900. G\u00f6del showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be disproven from the axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice), by developing the constructible universe of set theory in which the continuum hypothesis must hold. In 1963, Paul Cohen showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be proven from the axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (Cohen 1966). This independence result did not completely settle Hilbert's question, however, as it is possible that new axioms for set theory could resolve the hypothesis. Recent work along these lines has been conducted by W. Hugh Woodin, although its importance is not yet clear (Woodin 2001).\n\nContemporary research in set theory includes the study of large cardinals and determinacy.  Large cardinals are cardinal numbers with particular properties so strong that the existence of such cardinals cannot be proved in ZFC. The existence of the smallest large cardinal typically studied, an inaccessible cardinal, already implies the consistency of ZFC.  Despite the fact that large cardinals have extremely high cardinality, their existence has many ramifications for the structure of the real line.  Determinacy refers to the possible existence of winning strategies for certain two-player games (the games are said to be determined). The existence of these strategies implies structural properties of the real line and other Polish spaces.\n\n Model theory \n\nModel theory studies the models of various formal theories.  Here a theory is a set of formulas in a particular formal logic and signature, while a model is a structure that gives a concrete interpretation of the theory. Model theory is closely related to universal algebra and algebraic geometry, although the methods of model theory focus more on logical considerations than those fields.\n\nThe set of all models of a particular theory is called an elementary class; classical model theory seeks to determine the properties of models in a particular elementary class, or determine whether certain classes of structures form elementary classes.\n\nThe method of quantifier elimination can be used to show that definable sets in particular theories cannot be too complicated.  Tarski (1948) established quantifier elimination for real-closed fields, a result which also shows the theory of the field of real numbers is decidable. (He also noted that his methods were equally applicable to algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic.) A modern subfield developing from this is concerned with o-minimal structures.\n\nMorley's categoricity theorem, proved by Michael D. Morley (1965), states that if a first-order theory in a countable language is categorical in some uncountable cardinality, i.e. all models of this cardinality are isomorphic, then it is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities.\n\nA trivial consequence of the continuum hypothesis is that a complete theory with less than continuum many nonisomorphic countable models can have only countably many. Vaught's conjecture, named after Robert Lawson Vaught, says that this is true even independently of the continuum hypothesis.  Many special cases of this conjecture have been established.\n\n Recursion theory \n\nRecursion theory, also called computability theory, studies the properties of computable functions and the Turing degrees, which divide the uncomputable functions into sets that have the same level of uncomputability.  Recursion theory also includes the study of generalized computability and definability.  Recursion theory grew from the work of R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in the 1930s, which was greatly extended by Kleene and Post in the 1940s.\n\nClassical recursion theory focuses on the computability of functions from the natural numbers to the natural numbers. The fundamental results establish a robust, canonical class of computable functions with numerous independent, equivalent characterizations using Turing machines, \u03bb calculus, and other systems.  More advanced results concern the structure of the Turing degrees and the lattice of recursively enumerable sets.\n\nGeneralized recursion theory extends the ideas of recursion theory to computations that are no longer necessarily finite. It includes the study of computability in higher types as well as areas such as hyperarithmetical theory and \u03b1-recursion theory.\n\nContemporary research in recursion theory includes the study of applications such as algorithmic randomness, computable model theory, and reverse mathematics, as well as new results in pure recursion theory.\n\n Algorithmically unsolvable problems \n\nAn important subfield of recursion theory studies algorithmic unsolvability; a decision problem or function problem is algorithmically unsolvable if there is no possible computable algorithm that returns the correct answer for all legal inputs to the problem. The first results about unsolvability, obtained independently by Church and Turing in 1936, showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is algorithmically unsolvable. Turing proved this by establishing the unsolvability of the halting problem, a result with far-ranging implications in both recursion theory and computer science.\n\nThere are many known examples of undecidable problems from ordinary mathematics. The word problem for groups was proved algorithmically unsolvable by Pyotr Novikov in 1955 and independently by W. Boone in 1959.  The busy beaver problem, developed by Tibor Rad\u00f3 in 1962, is another well-known example.\n\nHilbert's tenth problem asked for an algorithm to determine whether a multivariate polynomial equation with integer coefficients has a solution in the integers. Partial progress was made by Julia Robinson, Martin Davis and Hilary Putnam. The algorithmic unsolvability of the problem was proved by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970 (Davis 1973).\n\n Proof theory and constructive mathematics \n\nProof theory is the study of formal proofs in various logical deduction systems. These proofs are represented as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques.  Several deduction systems are commonly considered, including Hilbert-style deduction systems, systems of natural deduction, and the sequent calculus developed by Gentzen.\n\nThe study of constructive mathematics, in the context of mathematical logic, includes the study of systems in non-classical logic such as intuitionistic logic, as well as the study of predicative systems.  An early proponent of predicativism was Hermann Weyl, who showed it is possible to develop a large part of real analysis using only predicative methods (Weyl 1918).\n\nBecause proofs are entirely finitary, whereas truth in a structure is not, it is common for work in constructive mathematics to emphasize provability.   The relationship between provability in classical (or nonconstructive) systems and provability in intuitionistic (or constructive, respectively) systems is of particular interest.  Results such as the G\u00f6del\u2013Gentzen negative translation show that it is possible to embed (or translate) classical logic into intuitionistic logic, allowing some properties about intuitionistic proofs to be transferred back to classical proofs.\n\nRecent developments in proof theory include the study of proof mining by Ulrich Kohlenbach and the study of proof-theoretic ordinals by Michael Rathjen.\n\nApplications  \n\"Mathematical logic has been successfully applied not only to mathematics and its foundations (G. Frege, B. Russell, D. Hilbert, P. Bernays, H. Scholz, R. Carnap, S. Lesniewski, T. Skolem), but also to physics (R. Carnap, A. Dittrich, B. Russell, C. E. Shannon, A. N. Whitehead, H. Reichenbach, P. Fevrier), to biology (J. H. Woodger, A. Tarski), to psychology (F. B. Fitch, C. G. Hempel), to law and morals (K. Menger, U. Klug, P. Oppenheim), to economics (J. Neumann, O. Morgenstern), to practical questions (E. C. Berkeley, E. Stamm), and even to metaphysics (J. [Jan] Salamucha,\"Jan Salamucha\", http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Salamucha . H. Scholz, J. M. Bochenski).  Its applications to the history of logic have proven extremely fruitful (J. Lukasiewicz, H. Scholz, B. Mates, A. Becker, E. Moody, J. Salamucha, K. Duerr, Z. Jordan, P. Boehner, J. M. Bochenski, S. [Stanislaw] T. Schayer,\"Stanislaw Schayer\", http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Schayer . D. Ingalls).\"Jozef Maria Bochenski, A Precis of Mathematical Logic, rev. and trans., Albert Menne, ed. and trans., Otto Bird, Dordrecht,  South Holland:  Reidel, Sec. 0.3, p. 2.  \"Applications have also been made to theology (F.

Thomas).\"Jozef Maria Bochenski, A Precis of Mathematical Logic, rev. and trans., Albert Menne, ed. and trans., Otto Bird, Dordrecht, South Holland:  Reidel, Sec. 0.3, p. 2.\n\nConnections with computer science\n\nThe study of computability theory in computer science is closely related to the study of computability in mathematical logic.  There is a difference of emphasis, however.  Computer scientists often focus on concrete programming languages and feasible computability, while researchers in mathematical logic often focus on computability as a theoretical concept and on noncomputability.\n\nThe theory of semantics of programming languages is related to model theory, as is program verification (in particular, model checking). The Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism between proofs and programs relates to proof theory, especially intuitionistic logic. Formal calculi such as the lambda calculus and combinatory logic are now studied as idealized programming languages.\n\nComputer science also contributes to mathematics by developing techniques for the automatic checking or even finding of proofs, such as automated theorem proving and logic programming.\n\nDescriptive complexity theory relates logics to computational complexity. The first significant result in this area, Fagin's theorem (1974) established that NP is precisely the set of languages expressible by sentences of existential second-order logic.\n\n Foundations of mathematics \n\nIn the 19th century, mathematicians became aware of logical gaps and inconsistencies in their field. It was shown that Euclid's axioms for geometry, which had been taught for centuries as an example of the axiomatic method, were incomplete. The use of infinitesimals, and the very definition of function, came into question in analysis, as pathological examples such as Weierstrass' nowhere-differentiable continuous function were discovered.\n\nCantor's study of arbitrary infinite sets also drew criticism. Leopold Kronecker famously stated \"God made the integers; all else is the work of man,\" endorsing a return to the study of finite, concrete objects in mathematics. Although Kronecker's argument was carried forward by constructivists in the 20th century, the mathematical community as a whole rejected them. David Hilbert argued in favor of the study of the infinite, saying \"No one shall expel us from the Paradise that Cantor has created.\"\n\nMathematicians began to search for axiom systems that could be used to formalize large parts of mathematics. In addition to removing ambiguity from previously naive terms such as function, it was hoped that this axiomatization would allow for consistency proofs.  In the 19th century, the main method of proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a model for it. Thus, for example, non-Euclidean geometry can be proved consistent by defining point to mean a point on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great circle on the sphere. The resulting structure, a model of elliptic geometry, satisfies the axioms of plane geometry except the parallel postulate.\n\nWith the development of formal logic, Hilbert asked whether it would be possible to prove that an axiom system is consistent by analyzing the structure of possible proofs in the system, and showing through this analysis that it is impossible to prove a contradiction. This idea led to the study of proof theory. Moreover, Hilbert proposed that the analysis should be entirely concrete, using the term finitary to refer to the methods he would allow but not precisely defining them. This project, known as Hilbert's program, was seriously affected by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, which show that the consistency of formal theories of arithmetic cannot be established using methods formalizable in those theories. Gentzen showed that it is possible to produce a proof of the consistency of arithmetic in a finitary system augmented with axioms of transfinite induction, and the techniques he developed to do so were seminal in proof theory.\n\nA second thread in the history of foundations of mathematics involves nonclassical logics and constructive mathematics. The study of constructive mathematics includes many different programs with various definitions of constructive. At the most accommodating end, proofs in ZF set theory that do not use the axiom of choice are called constructive by many mathematicians. More limited versions of constructivism limit themselves to natural numbers, number-theoretic functions, and sets of natural numbers (which can be used to represent real numbers, facilitating the study of mathematical analysis). A common idea is that a concrete means of computing the values of the function must be known before the function itself can be said to exist. \n\nIn the early 20th century, Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer founded intuitionism as a philosophy of mathematics. This philosophy, poorly understood at first, stated that in order for a mathematical statement to be true to a mathematician, that person must be able to intuit the statement, to not only believe its truth but understand the reason for its truth. A consequence of this definition of truth was the rejection of the law of the excluded middle, for there are statements that, according to Brouwer, could not be claimed to be true while their negations also could not be claimed true.  Brouwer's philosophy was influential, and the cause of bitter disputes among prominent mathematicians. Later, Kleene and Kreisel would study formalized versions of intuitionistic logic (Brouwer rejected formalization, and presented his work in unformalized natural language). With the advent of the BHK interpretation and Kripke models, intuitionism became easier to reconcile with classical mathematics.\n\n See also \n\n Knowledge representation and reasoning\n List of computability and complexity topics\n List of first-order theories\n List of logic symbols\n List of mathematical logic topics\n List of set theory topics\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n Undergraduate texts \n .\n\n .\n .\n .\n .

{"title": "Naive set theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory", "text": "Na\u00efve set theory is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics.\nJeff Miller writes that na\u00efve set theory (as opposed to axiomatic set theory) was used occasionally in the 1940s and became an established term in the 1950s. It appears in Hermann Weyl's review of P. A. Schilpp (Ed). (1946). \u201cThe Philosophy of Bertrand Russell\u201d American Mathematical Monthly, 53(4), p.\u00a0210 and in a review by Laszlo Kalmar. (1946). \u201cThe Paradox of Kleene and Rosser\u201d. Journal of Symbolic Logic, 11(4), p.\u00a0136. (JSTOR).  The term was later popularized in a book by Paul Halmos (1960). Na\u00efve Set Theory.\nUnlike axiomatic set theories, which are defined using formal logic, na\u00efve set theory is defined informally, in natural language. It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics (for example Venn diagrams and symbolic reasoning about their Boolean algebra), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.. \"The working mathematicians usually thought in terms of a na\u00efve set theory (probably one more or less equivalent to ZF) ... a practical requirement [of any new foundational system] could be that this system could be used \"na\u00efvely\" by mathematicians not sophisticated in foundational research\" (p.\u00a0236).\n\nSets are of great importance in mathematics; in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects (numbers, relations, functions, etc.) are defined in terms of sets. Na\u00efve set theory suffices for many purposes, while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments. \n\nMethod\nA na\u00efve theory in the sense of \"na\u00efve set theory\" is a non-formalized theory, that is, a theory that uses a natural language to describe sets and operations on sets. The words and, or, if ... then, not, for some, for every are treated as in ordinary mathematics. As a matter of convenience, use of na\u00efve set theory and its formalism prevails even in higher mathematics \u2013 including in more formal settings of set theory itself.\n\nThe first development of set theory was a na\u00efve set theory. It was created at the end of the 19th\u00a0century by Georg Cantor as part of his study of infinite sets and developed by Gottlob Frege in his Begriffsschrift.\n\nNa\u00efve set theory may refer to several very distinct notions. It may refer to\n Informal presentation of an axiomatic set theory, e.g. as in Na\u00efve Set Theory by Paul Halmos.\n Early or later versions of Georg Cantor's theory and other informal systems.\n Decidedly inconsistent theories (whether axiomatic or not), such as a theory of Gottlob Frege In Volume 2, Jena 1903. pp. 253-261 Frege discusses the antionomy in the afterword. that yielded Russell's paradox, and theories of Giuseppe Peano Axiom 52. chap. IV produces antinomies. and Richard Dedekind.\n\nParadoxes\nThe assumption that any property may be used to form a set, without restriction, leads to paradoxes.  One common example is Russell's paradox: there is no set consisting of \"all sets that do not contain themselves\". Thus consistent systems of na\u00efve set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets.\n\nCantor's theory\nSome believe that Georg Cantor's set theory was not actually implicated in the set-theoretic paradoxes (see Fr\u00e1polli 1991). One difficulty in determining this with certainty is that Cantor did not provide an axiomatization of his system. By 1899, Cantor was aware of some of the paradoxes following from unrestricted interpretation of his theory, for instance Cantor's paradoxLetter from Cantor to David Hilbert on September 26, 1897,  p. 388. and the Burali-Forti paradox,Letter from Cantor to Richard Dedekind on August 3, 1899,  p. 408. and did not believe that they discredited his theory.Letters from Cantor to Richard Dedekind on August 3, 1899 and on August 30, 1899,  p. 448 (System aller denkbaren Klassen) and  p. 407. (There is no set of all sets.) Cantor's paradox can actually be derived from the above (false) assumption\u2014that any property  may be used to form a set\u2014using for  is a cardinal number\". Frege explicitly axiomatized a theory in which a formalized version of na\u00efve set theory can be interpreted, and it is this formal theory which Bertrand Russell actually addressed when he presented his paradox, not necessarily a theory Cantor, who, as mentioned, was aware of several paradoxes, presumably had in mind.\n\nAxiomatic theories\nAxiomatic set theory was developed in response to these early attempts to understand sets, with the goal of determining precisely what operations were allowed and when.\n\nConsistency\nA na\u00efve set theory is not necessarily inconsistent, if it correctly specifies the sets allowed to be considered. This can be done by the means of definitions, which are implicit axioms. It is possible to state all the axioms explicitly, as in the case of Halmos' Na\u00efve Set Theory, which is actually an informal presentation of the usual axiomatic Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory. It is \"na\u00efve\" in that the language and notations are those of ordinary informal mathematics, and in that it doesn't deal with consistency or completeness of the axiom system.\n\nLikewise, an axiomatic set theory is not necessarily consistent: not necessarily free of paradoxes. It follows from G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems that a sufficiently complicated first order logic system (which includes most common axiomatic set theories) cannot be proved consistent from within the theory itself \u2013 even if it actually is consistent. However, the common axiomatic systems are generally believed to be consistent; by their axioms they do exclude some paradoxes, like Russell's paradox. Based on G\u00f6del's theorem, it is just not known \u2013 and never can be \u2013 if there are no paradoxes at all in these theories or in any first-order set theory.\n\nThe term na\u00efve set theory is still today also used in some literature to refer to the set theories studied by Frege and Cantor, rather than to the informal counterparts of modern axiomatic set theory.\n\nUtility\nThe choice between an axiomatic approach and other approaches is largely a matter of convenience. In everyday mathematics the best choice may be informal use of axiomatic set theory.  References to particular axioms typically then occur only when demanded by tradition, e.g. the axiom of choice is often mentioned when used. Likewise, formal proofs occur only when warranted by exceptional circumstances. This informal usage of axiomatic set theory can have (depending on notation) precisely the appearance of na\u00efve set theory as outlined below. It is considerably easier to read and write (in the formulation of most statements, proofs, and lines of discussion) and is less error-prone than a strictly formal approach.\n\n Sets, membership and equality \nIn na\u00efve set theory, a set is described as a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called the elements or members of the set. Objects can be anything: numbers, people, other sets, etc. For instance, 4 is a member of the set of all even integers. Clearly, the set of even numbers is infinitely large; there is no requirement that a set be finite.\n\nthumb|Passage with the original set definition of Georg Cantor\nThe definition of sets goes back to Georg Cantor. He wrote 1915 in his article Beitr\u00e4ge zur Begr\u00fcndung der transfiniten Mengenlehre:\n\n\u201cUnter einer 'Menge' verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung M von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objekten unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens (welche die 'Elemente' von M genannt werden) zu einem Ganzen.\u201d \u2013 Georg Cantor\n\u201cA set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thought\u2014which are called elements of the set.\u201d \u2013 Georg Cantor\n\nthumb|right|First usage of the symbol \u03f5 in the work Arithmetices principia nova methodo exposita by Giuseppe Peano.\n\n Note on consistency \nIt does not follow from this definition how sets can be formed, and what operations on sets again will produce a set. The term \"well-defined\" in \"well-defined collection of objects\" cannot, by itself, guarantee the consistency and unambiguity of what exactly constitutes and what does not constitute a set. Attempting to achieve this would be the realm of axiomatic set theory or of axiomatic class theory.\n\nThe problem, in this context, with informally formulated set theories, not derived from (and implying) any particular axiomatic theory, is that there may be several widely differing formalized versions, that have both different sets and different rules for how new sets may be formed, that all conform to the original informal definition. For example, Cantor's verbatim definition allows for considerable freedom in what constitutes a set. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Cantor was particularly interested in sets containing cats and dogs, but rather only in sets containing purely mathematical objects. An example of such a class of sets could be the von Neumann universe. But even when fixing the class of sets under consideration, it is not always clear which rules for set formation are allowed without introducing paradoxes.\n\nFor the purpose of fixing the discussion below, the term \"well-defined\" should instead be interpreted as an intention, with either implicit or explicit rules (axioms or definitions), to rule out inconsistencies. The purpose is to keep the often deep and difficult issues of consistency away from the, usually simpler, context at hand. An explicit ruling out of all conceivable inconsistencies (paradoxes) cannot be achieved for an axiomatic set theory anyway, due to G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem, so this does not at all hamper the utility of na\u00efve set theory as compared to axiomatic set theory in the simple contexts considered below. It merely simplifies the discussion. Consistency is henceforth taken for granted unless explicitly mentioned.\n\n Membership \nIf x is a member of a set A, then it is also said that x belongs to A, or that x is in A. This is denoted by x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0A. The symbol \u2208 is a derivation from the lowercase Greek letter epsilon, \"\u03b5\", introduced by Giuseppe Peano in 1889 and shall be the first letter of the word \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af (means \"is\"). The symbol \u2209 is often used to write x\u00a0\u2209\u00a0A, meaning \"x is not in A\".\n\n Equality \nTwo sets A and B are defined to be equal when they have precisely the same elements, that is, if every element of A is an element of B and every element of B is an element of A. (See axiom of extensionality.) Thus a set is completely determined by its elements; the description is immaterial. For example, the set with elements 2, 3, and 5 is equal to the set of all prime numbers less than 6.\nIf the sets A and B are equal, this is denoted symbolically as A\u00a0=\u00a0B (as usual).\n\n Empty set \nThe empty set, often denoted \u00d8 and sometimes , is a set with no members at all. Because a set is determined completely by its elements, there can be only one empty set. (See axiom of empty set.) Although the empty set has no members, it can be a member of other sets. Thus \u00d8 \u2260 {\u00d8}, because the former has no members and the latter has one member. In mathematics, the only sets with which one needs to be concerned can be built up from the empty set alone.()\n\n Specifying sets \nThe simplest way to describe a set is to list its elements between curly braces (known as defining a set extensionally). Thus  denotes the set whose only elements are  and .\n(See axiom of pairing.)\nNote the following points:\nThe order of elements is immaterial; for example, .\nRepetition (multiplicity) of elements is irrelevant; for example, .\n(These are consequences of the definition of equality in the previous section.)\n\nThis notation can be informally abused by saying something like  to indicate the set of all dogs, but this example would usually be read by mathematicians as \"the set containing the single element dogs\".\n\nAn extreme (but correct) example of this notation is , which denotes the empty set.\n\nThe notation , or sometimes , is used to denote the set containing all objects for which the condition  holds (known as defining a set intensionally).\nFor example,  \u2208 R} denotes the set of real numbers,  denotes the set of everything with blonde hair.\n\nThis notation is called set-builder notation (or \"set comprehension\", particularly in the context of Functional programming).\nSome variants of set builder notation are:\n denotes the set of all  that are already members of  such that the condition  holds for . For example, if  is the set of integers, then  is the set of all even integers. (See axiom of specification.)\n denotes the set of all objects obtained by putting members of the set  into the formula . For example,  is again the set of all even integers. (See axiom of replacement.)\n is the most general form of set builder notation. For example, {{math|{xs\u00a0owner\u00a0: x\u00a0is a dog}}} is the set of all dog owners.\n\n Subsets \nGiven two sets A and B, A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B.\nIn particular, each set B is a subset of itself; a subset of B that is not equal to B is called a proper subset.\n\nIf A is a subset of B, then one can also say that B is a superset of A, that A is contained in B, or that B contains A. In symbols, A\u00a0\u2286\u00a0B means that A is a subset of B, and B\u00a0\u2287\u00a0A means that B is a superset of A.\nSome authors use the symbols \u2282 and \u2283 for subsets, and others use these symbols only for proper subsets. For clarity, one can explicitly use the symbols \u228a and \u228b to indicate non-equality.\n\nAs an illustration, let R be the set of real numbers, let Z be the set of integers, let O be the set of odd integers, and let P be the set of current or former U.S. Presidents.\nThen O is a subset of Z, Z is a subset of R, and (hence) O is a subset of R, where in all cases subset may even be read as proper subset.\nNote that not all sets are comparable in this way. For example, it is not the case either that R is a subset of P nor that P is a subset of R.\n\nIt follows immediately from the definition of equality of sets above that, given two sets A and B, A\u00a0=\u00a0B if and only if A\u00a0\u2286\u00a0B and B\u00a0\u2286\u00a0A. In fact this is often given as the definition of equality. Usually when trying to prove that two sets are equal, one aims to show these two inclusions. Note that the empty set is a subset of every set (the statement that all elements of the empty set are also members of any set A is vacuously true).\n\nThe set of all subsets of a given set A is called the power set of A and is denoted by  or ; the \"P\" is sometimes in a script font. If the set A has n elements, then  will have  elements.\n\n Universal sets and absolute complements \nIn certain contexts, one may consider all sets under consideration as being subsets of some given universal set.\nFor instance, when investigating properties of the real numbers R (and subsets of R), R may be taken as the universal set. A true universal set is not included in standard set theory (see Paradoxes below), but is included in some non-standard set theories.\n\nGiven a universal set U and a subset A of U, the complement of A (in U) is defined as\nAC\u00a0:= {x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0U'''\u00a0: x\u00a0\u2209\u00a0A}.\nIn other words, AC (\"A-complement\"; sometimes simply A, \"A-prime\" ) is the set of all members of U which are not members of A.\nThus with R, Z and O defined as in the section on subsets, if Z is the universal set, then OC is the set of even integers, while if R is the universal set, then OC is the set of all real numbers that are either even integers or not integers at all.\n\n Unions, intersections, and relative complements \nGiven two sets A and B, their union is the set consisting of all objects which are elements of A or of B or of both (see axiom of union). It is denoted by A\u00a0\u222a\u00a0B.\n\nThe intersection of A and B is the set of all objects which are both in A and in B. It is denoted by A\u00a0\u2229\u00a0B.\n\nFinally, the relative complement of B relative to A, also known as the set theoretic difference of A and B, is the set of all objects that belong to A but not to B. It is written as A\u00a0\\\u00a0B or A\u00a0\u2212\u00a0B.\n\nSymbolically, these are respectively\nA\u00a0\u222a\u00a0B\u00a0:= {x\u00a0: (x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0A)\u00a0or (x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0B)};\nA\u00a0\u2229\u00a0B\u00a0:= {x\u00a0: (x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0A)\u00a0and (x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0B)}\u00a0= {x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0A\u00a0: x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0B}\u00a0= {x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0B\u00a0: x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0A};\nA\u00a0\\\u00a0B\u00a0:= {x\u00a0: (x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0A)\u00a0and\u00a0not (x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0B) }\u00a0= {x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0A\u00a0: not (x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0B)}.\n\nNotice that A doesn't have to be a subset of B for B\u00a0\\\u00a0A to make sense; this is the difference between the relative complement and the absolute complement (AC = U\u00a0\\\u00a0A) from the previous section.\n\nTo illustrate these ideas, let A be the set of left-handed people, and let B be the set of people with blond hair. Then A\u00a0\u2229\u00a0B is the set of all left-handed blond-haired people, while A\u00a0\u222a\u00a0B is the set of all people who are left-handed or blond-haired or both. A\u00a0\\\u00a0B, on the other hand, is the set of all people that are left-handed but not blond-haired, while B\u00a0\\\u00a0A is the set of all people who have blond hair but aren't left-handed.\n\nNow let E be the set of all human beings, and let F be the set of all living things over 1000 years old. What is E\u00a0\u2229\u00a0F in this case? No living human being is over 1000 years old, so E\u00a0\u2229\u00a0F must be the empty set {}.\n\nFor any set A, the power set  is a Boolean algebra under the operations of union and intersection.\n\n Ordered pairs and Cartesian products \nIntuitively, an ordered pair is simply a collection of two objects such that one can be distinguished as the first element and the other as the second element, and having the fundamental property that, two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their first elements are equal and their second elements are equal.\n\nFormally, an ordered pair with first coordinate a, and second coordinate b, usually denoted by (a, b), can be defined as the set {{a},\u00a0{a, b}}.\n\nIt follows that, two ordered pairs (a,b) and (c,d) are equal if and only if a\u00a0=\u00a0c and b\u00a0=\u00a0d.\n\nAlternatively, an ordered pair can be formally thought of as a set {a,b} with a total order.\n\n(The notation (a, b) is also used to denote an open interval on the real number line, but the context should make it clear which meaning is intended. Otherwise, the notation ]a, b[ may be used to denote the open interval whereas (a, b) is used for the ordered pair).\n\nIf A and B are sets, then the Cartesian product (or simply product) is defined to be:\nA\u00a0\u00d7 B\u00a0= {(a,b)\u00a0: a is in A and b is in B}.\nThat is, A\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0B is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an element of A and whose second coordinate is an element of B.\n\nThis definition may be extended to a set A\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0B\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0C of ordered triples, and more generally to sets of ordered n-tuples for any positive integer n.\nIt is even possible to define infinite Cartesian products, but this requires a more recondite definition of the product.\n\nCartesian products were first developed by Ren\u00e9 Descartes in the context of analytic geometry. If R denotes the set of all real numbers, then R2\u00a0:=\u00a0R\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0R represents the Euclidean plane and R3\u00a0:=\u00a0R\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0R\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0R represents three-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\n Some important sets \nThere are some ubiquitous sets that for which the notation is almost universal. Some of these are listed below. In the list, a, b, and c refer natural numbers, and r and s are real numbers.\n Natural numbers are used for counting. A blackboard bold capital N () often represents this set.\n Integers appear as solutions for x in equations like x + a = b. A blackboard bold capital Z () often represents this set (from the German Zahlen, meaning numbers).\n Rational numbers appear as solutions to equations like a + bx = c. A blackboard bold capital Q () often represents this set (for quotient, because R is used for the set of real numbers).\n Algebraic numbers appear as solutions to polynomial equations (with integer coefficients) and may involve radicals (including ) and certain other irrational numbers. A Q with an overline () often represents this set. The overline denotes the operation of algebraic closure.\n Real numbers represent the \"real line\" and include all numbers that can be approximated by rationals. These numbers may be rational or algebraic but may also be transcendental numbers, which cannot appear as solutions to polynomial equations with rational coefficients. A blackboard bold capital R () often represents this set.\n Complex numbers are sums of a real and an imaginary number: . Here either  or  (or both) can be zero; thus, the set of real numbers and the set of strictly imaginary numbers are subsets of the set of complex numbers, which form an algebraic closure for the set of real numbers, meaning that every polynomial with coefficients in  has at least one root in this set. A blackboard bold capital C () often represents this set. Note that since a number  can be identified with a point  in the plane,  is basically \"the same\" as the Cartesian product \u00d7 (\"the same\" meaning that any point in one determines a unique point in the other and for the result of calculations, it doesn't matter which one is used for the calculation, as long as multiplication rule is appropriate for ).\n\n Paradoxes in early set theory \n\nThe unrestricted formation principle of sets referred to as the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension,\nIf  is a property, then there exists a set  (false), p. 4.\nis the source of several early appearing paradoxes:\n leads 1897 to the Burali-Forti paradox, the first published antinomy.\n produced Cantor's paradox in 1897.\n yielded Cantor's second antinomy in the year 1899. Here the property  is true for all , whatever  may be, so  would be a universal set, containing everything.\n, i.e. the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as elements gave Russell's paradox 1902.\n\nIf the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is weakened to the axiom schema of specification or axiom schema of separation,\nIf  is a property, then for any set  there exists a set ,\nthen all the above paradoxes disappear. There is a corollary. With the axiom schema of separation as an axiom of the theory, it follows, as a theorem of the theory:\nThe set of all sets does not exist.\nOr, more spectacularly (Halmos' phrasing): There is no universe. Proof: Suppose that it exists and call it . Now apply the axiom schema of separation with  and for  use . This leads to Russell's paradox again. Hence  can't exist in this theory.\n\nRelated to the above constructions is formation of the set\n, where the statement following the implication certainly is false. It follows, from the definition of , using the usual inference rules (and some afterthought when reading the proof in the linked article below) both that  and  holds, hence . This is Curry's paradox.\n\nIt is (perhaps surprisingly) not the possibility of  that is problematic. It is again the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension allowing  for . With the axiom schema of specification instead of unrestricted comprehension, the conclusion  doesn't hold and, hence  is not a logical consequence.\n\nNonetheless, the possibility of  is often removed explicitly See discussion around Russell's paradox. or, e.g. in ZFC, implicitly, Section 1.6. by demanding the axiom of regularity to hold. One consequence of it is\nThere is no set  for which ,\nor, in other words, no set is an element of itself. p. 61.\n\nThe axiom schema of separation is simply too weak (while unrestricted comprehension is a very strong axiom\u2014too strong for set theory) to develop set theory with its usual operations and constructions outlined above. The axiom of regularity is of a restrictive nature as well. Therefore, one is led to the formulation of other axioms to guarantee the existence of enough sets to form a set theory. Some of these have been described informally above and many others are possible. Not all conceivable axioms can be combined freely into consistent theories. For example, the axiom of choice of ZFC is incompatible with the conceivable every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable'. The former implies the latter is false.\n\nSee also\n\n Algebra of sets\n Axiomatic set theory\n Internal set theory\n Set theory\n Set (mathematics)\n Partially ordered set\n\n Notes \n\nReferences\n Bourbaki, N., Elements of the History of Mathematics, John Meldrum (trans.), Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, 1994.\n\n Devlin, K.J., The Joy of Sets: Fundamentals of Contemporary Set Theory, 2nd edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, 1993.\n Mar\u00eda J.

{"title": "Number", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number", "text": "thumb|Subsets of the complex numbers.\nA number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. A written symbol like \"5\" that represents a number is called a numeral. A numeral system is an organized way to write and manipulate this type of symbol, for example the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system allows combinations of numerical digits like \"5\" and \"0\" to represent larger numbers like 50. A numeral in linguistics can refer to a symbol like 5, the words or phrase that names a number, like \"five hundred\", or other words that mean a specific number, like \"dozen\". In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, number may refer to a symbol, a word or phrase, or the mathematical object.\n\nIn mathematics, the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as  and , real numbersT.K. Puttaswamy, \"The Accomplishments of Ancient Indian Mathematicians\", pp. 410\u201311.\u00a0In: . such as  and , and complex numbers, which extend the real numbers with a square root of  (and its combinations with real numbers by addition and multiplication). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic. The same term may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\n\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world.Gilsdorf, Thomas E. Introduction to Cultural Mathematics: With Case Studies in the Otomies and Incas, John Wiley & Sons, Feb 24, 2012.Restivo, S. Mathematics in Society and History, Springer Science & Business Media, Nov 30, 1992. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot.\" Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought.Ore, Oystein. Number Theory and Its History, Courier Dover Publications. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.\n\nDuring the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. Today, number systems are considered important special examples of much more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.Gouvea, Fernando Q. The Princeton Companion to Mathematics, Chapter II.1, \"The Origins of Modern Mathematics\", p. 82. Princeton University Press, September 28, 2008. .\n\nHistory\n\nNumerals\n\nNumbers should be distinguished from numerals, the symbols used to represent numbers. The Egyptians invented the first ciphered numeral system, and the Greeks followed by mapping their counting numbers onto Ionian and Doric alphabets. Roman numerals, a system that used combinations of letters from the Roman alphabet, remained dominant in Europe until the spread of the superior Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system around the late 14th century, and the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system remains the most common system for representing numbers in the world today. The key to the effectiveness of the system was the symbol for zero, which was developed by ancient  Indian mathematicians around 500 AD.\n\nFirst use of numbers\n\nBones and other artifacts have been discovered with marks cut into them that many believe are tally marks.Marshak, A., The Roots of Civilisation; Cognitive Beginnings of Man\u2019s First Art, Symbol and Notation, (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London: 1972), 81ff. These tally marks may have been used for counting elapsed time, such as numbers of days, lunar cycles or keeping records of quantities, such as of animals.\n\nA tallying system has no concept of place value (as in modern decimal notation), which limits its representation of large numbers. Nonetheless tallying systems are considered the first kind of abstract numeral system.\n\nThe first known system with place value was the Mesopotamian base\u00a060 system (ca. 3400\u00a0BC) and the earliest known base\u00a010 system dates to 3100\u00a0BC in Egypt.\n\nZero \nThe first known documented use of zero dates to AD 628, and appeared in the Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta, the main work of the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta.  He treated\u00a00 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including division. By this time (the 7th\u00a0century) the concept had clearly reached Cambodia as Khmer numerals, and documentation shows the idea later spreading to China and the Islamic world.\n\nthumb|The number 605 in Khmer numerals, from an inscription from 683 AD. Early use of zero as a decimal figure.\n\nBrahmagupta's Brahmasphu\u1e6dasiddhanta is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as 'Zero plus a positive number is a positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number'. The Brahmasphutasiddhanta is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.\n\nThe use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in place-value systems. Many ancient texts used\u00a00. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word nfr to denote zero\u00a0balance in double entry accounting. Indian texts used a Sanskrit word  or  to refer to the concept of void. In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero. In a similar vein, P\u0101\u1e47ini (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the Ashtadhyayi, an early example of an algebraic grammar for the Sanskrit language (also see Pingala).\n\nThere are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the Brahmasphutasiddhanta.\n\nRecords show that the Ancient Greeks seemed unsure about the status of\u00a00 as a number: they asked themselves \"how can 'nothing' be something?\" leading to interesting philosophical and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of\u00a00 and the vacuum. The paradoxes of Zeno of Elea depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of\u00a00. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether\u00a0 was a number.)\n\nThe late Olmec people of south-central Mexico began to use a symbol for zero, a shell glyph, in the New World, possibly by the  but certainly by 40\u00a0BC, which became an integral part of Maya numerals and the Maya calendar. Mayan arithmetic used base\u00a04 and base\u00a05 written as base\u00a020. Sanchez in 1961 reported a base\u00a04, base\u00a05 \"finger\" abacus.\n\nBy 130 AD, Ptolemy, influenced by Hipparchus and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for\u00a00 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic Greek numerals. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this Hellenistic zero was the first documented use of a true zero in the Old World. In later Byzantine manuscripts of his Syntaxis Mathematica (Almagest), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the Greek letter Omicron (otherwise meaning\u00a070).\n\nAnother true zero was used in tables alongside Roman numerals by 525 (first known use by Dionysius Exiguus), but as a word,  meaning nothing, not as a symbol. When division produced\u00a00 as a remainder, , also meaning nothing, was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval computists (calculators of Easter). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by Bede or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.\n\nNegative numbers \n\nThe abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100\u201350 BC in China.  The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive coefficients, black for negative. The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd\u00a0century AD in Greece. Diophantus referred to the equation equivalent to  (the solution is negative) in Arithmetica, saying that the equation gave an absurd result.\n\nDuring the 600s, negative numbers were in use in India to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, in Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form quadratic formula that remains in use today. However, in the 12th\u00a0century in India, Bhaskara gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value \"is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots.\"\n\nEuropean mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th\u00a0century, although Fibonacci allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter\u00a013 of Liber Abaci, 1202) and later as losses (in ). At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral. The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by Nicolas Chuquet during the 15th\u00a0century. He used them as exponents, but referred to them as \"absurd numbers\".\n\nAs recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless, just as Ren\u00e9 Descartes did with negative solutions in a Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nRational numbers \nIt is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to prehistoric times. The Ancient Egyptians used their Egyptian fraction notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of number theory. The best known of these is Euclid's Elements, dating to roughly 300\u00a0 BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the Sthananga Sutra, which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.\n\nThe concept of decimal fractions is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to pi or the square root of 2. Similarly, Babylonian math texts had always used sexagesimal (base\u00a060) fractions with great frequency.\n\nIrrational numbers \n\nThe earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the Indian Sulba Sutras composed between 800 and 500\u00a0BC. The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to Pythagoras, more specifically to the Pythagorean Hippasus of Metapontum, who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.\n\nThe 16th century brought final European acceptance of negative integral and fractional numbers. By the 17th\u00a0 century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th\u00a0 century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook the scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since Euclid. In 1872, the publication of the theories of Karl Weierstrass (by his pupil E. Kossak), Eduard Heine (Crelle, 74), Georg Cantor (Annalen, 5), and Richard Dedekind was brought about. In 1869, Charles M\u00e9ray had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method was completely set forth by Salvatore Pincherle (1880), and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and endorsement by Paul Tannery (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a cut (Schnitt) in the system of real numbers, separating all rational numbers into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, Kronecker (Crelle, 101), and M\u00e9ray.\n\nThe search for roots of quintic and higher degree equations was an important development, the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem (Ruffini 1799, Abel 1824) showed that they could not be solved by radicals (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of algebraic numbers (all solutions to polynomial equations). Galois (1832) linked polynomial equations to group theory giving rise to the field of Galois theory.\n\nContinued fractions, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of Euler, and at the opening of the 19th\u00a0century were brought into prominence through the writings of Joseph Louis Lagrange. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by Druckenm\u00fcller (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and G\u00fcnther (1872). Ramus (1855) first connected the subject with determinants, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, M\u00f6bius, and G\u00fcnther, in the theory of Kettenbruchdeterminanten.\n\nTranscendental numbers and reals \n\nThe existence of transcendental numbers was first established by Liouville (1844, 1851). Hermite proved in 1873 that e is transcendental and Lindemann proved in 1882 that \u03c0 is transcendental. Finally, Cantor showed that the set of all real numbers is uncountably infinite but the set of all algebraic numbers is countably infinite, so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.\n\nInfinity and infinitesimals \n\nThe earliest known conception of mathematical infinity appears in the Yajur Veda, an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, \"If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity.\" Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the Jain mathematicians c. 400\u00a0BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually.\n\nAristotle defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between actual infinity and potential infinity\u2014the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. Galileo Galilei's Two New Sciences discussed the idea of one-to-one correspondences between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by Georg Cantor; in 1895 he published a book about his new set theory, introducing, among other things, transfinite numbers and formulating the continuum hypothesis.\n\nIn the 1960s, Abraham Robinson showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of hyperreal numbers represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about infinite and infinitesimal numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz.\n\nA modern geometrical version of infinity is given by projective geometry, which introduces \"ideal points at infinity\", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in perspective drawing.\n\nComplex numbers \n\nThe earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor Heron of Alexandria in the , when he considered the volume of an impossible frustum of a pyramid. They became more prominent when in the 16th\u00a0century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia and Gerolamo Cardano. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.\n\nThis was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When Ren\u00e9 Descartes coined the term \"imaginary\" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See imaginary number for a discussion of the \"reality\" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation\n\nseemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity\n\nwhich is valid for positive real numbers a and b, and was also used in complex number calculations with one of a, b positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity\n\nin the case when both a and b are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol i in place of  to guard against this mistake.\n\nThe 18th century saw the work of Abraham de Moivre and Leonhard Euler. De Moivre's formula (1730) states:\n\nwhile Euler's formula of complex analysis (1748) gave us:\n\nThe existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until Caspar Wessel described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. Carl Friedrich Gauss rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in Wallis's De Algebra tractatus.\n\nAlso in 1799, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. The general acceptance of the theory of complex numbers is due to the labors of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Niels Henrik Abel, and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex numbers with a success that is well known.\n\nGauss studied complex numbers of the form , where a and b are integral, or rational (and i is one of the two roots of ). His student, Gotthold Eisenstein, studied the type , where \u03c9 is a complex root of  Other such classes (called cyclotomic fields) of complex numbers derive from the roots of unity  for higher values of k. This generalization is largely due to Ernst Kummer, who also invented ideal numbers, which were expressed as geometrical entities by Felix Klein in 1893.\n\nIn 1850 Victor Alexandre Puiseux took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of essential singular points. This eventually led to the concept of the extended complex plane.\n\nPrime numbers \nPrime numbers have been studied throughout recorded history. Euclid devoted one book of the Elements to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and presented the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n\nIn 240 BC, Eratosthenes used the Sieve of Eratosthenes to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the Renaissance and later eras.\n\nIn 1796, Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectured the prime number theorem, describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the Goldbach conjecture, which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the Riemann hypothesis, formulated by Bernhard Riemann in 1859. The prime number theorem was finally proved by Jacques Hadamard and Charles de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.\n\nMain classification\n\nNumbers can be classified into sets, called number systems, such as the natural numbers and the real numbers.\"Eine Menge, ist die Zusammenfassung bestimmter, wohlunterschiedener Objekte unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens \u2013 welche Elemente der Menge genannt werden \u2013 zu einem Ganzen.\" [1] The major categories of numbers are as follows:+ Main number systemsNatural 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\n or  are sometimes used.Integer..., \u22125, \u22124, \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...Rational where a and b are integers and b is not 0RealThe limit of a convergent sequence of rational numbersComplexa + bi where a and b are real numbers and i is a formal square root of\u00a0\u22121\n\nThere is generally no problem in identifying each number system with a proper subset of the next one (by abuse of notation), because each of these number systems is canonically isomorphic to a proper subset of the next one. The resulting hierarchy allows, for example, to talk, formally correctly, about real numbers that are rational numbers, and is expressed symbolically by writing\n.\n\nNatural numbers\n\nthumb|The natural numbers, starting with 1\nThe most familiar numbers are the natural numbers (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with\u00a01 (0 was not even considered a number for the Ancient Greeks.) However, in the 19th\u00a0century, set theorists and other mathematicians started including\u00a00 (cardinality of the empty set, i.e. 0\u00a0elements, where\u00a00 is thus the smallest cardinal number) in the set of natural numbers.  Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including\u00a00 or not. The mathematical symbol for the set of all natural numbers is N, also written , and sometimes  or  when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.\n\nIn the base 10 numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base\u00a010 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a place value of\u00a01, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.\n\nIn set theory, which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics, natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number\u00a03 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in Peano Arithmetic, the number\u00a03 is represented as sss0, where s is the \"successor\" function (i.e.,\u00a03 is the third successor of\u00a00). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent\u00a03 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.\n\nIntegers\n\nThe negative of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces\u00a00 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a minus sign). As an example, the negative of\u00a07 is written\u00a0\u22127, and . When the set of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including\u00a00), the result is defined as the set of integers, Z also written . Here the letter Z comes . The set of integers forms a ring with the operations addition and multiplication.\n\nThe natural numbers form a subset of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as positive integers, and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as non-negative integers.\n\nRational numbers\n\nA rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction  represents m parts of a whole divided into n equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example  and  are equal, that is:\n \n\nIn general,\n if and only if \n\nIf the absolute value of m is greater than n (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than\u00a01. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to\u00a01 and can also be positive, negative, or\u00a00. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator\u00a01. For example\u00a0\u22127 can be written\u00a0. The symbol for the rational numbers is Q (for quotient), also written .\n\nReal numbers\n\nThe symbol for the real numbers is R, also written as  They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a minus sign, e.g. -123.456.\n\nMost real numbers can only be approximated by decimal numerals, in which a decimal point is placed to the right of the digit with place value\u00a01. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents , or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its fractional part has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.  Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern.  Such a decimal is called a repeating decimal. Thus  can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0..\n\nIt turns out that these repeating decimals (including the repetition of zeroes) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called irrational. A famous irrational real number is the number , the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter. When pi is written as\n\nas it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that  is irrational. Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is\n\nthe square root of 2, that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions  of digits.\n\nNot only these prominent examples but almost all real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting rounded or truncated real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only countably many. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always have a margin of error. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to  and strictly less than  (rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number  greater or equal to  and strictly less than  (truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called significant digits. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001\u00a0 meters. If the sides of a rectangle are measured as 1.23\u00a0meters and 4.56\u00a0meters, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between  and . Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not significant. Therefore, the result is usually rounded to 5.61.\n\nJust as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, 0.999..., 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number\u00a01. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places.  In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9's, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros.  Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000.... Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0's can be rewritten by dropping the 0's to the right of the decimal place, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9's can be rewritten by increasing the rightmost -9 digit by one, changing all the 9's to the right of that digit to 0's. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0's to the right of the decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85.  Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.  For example, 99.999... = 100.\n\nThe real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the least upper bound property.\n\nIt can be shown that any ordered field, which is also complete, is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an algebraically closed field, because they do not include a solution (often called a square root of minus one) to the algebraic equation .\n\nComplex numbers\n\nMoving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the complex numbers. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of cubic and quadratic polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a square root of\u00a0\u22121, denoted by i, a symbol assigned by Leonhard Euler, and called the imaginary unit. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form\n\nwhere a and b are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the complex plane, a vector space of two real dimensions. In the expression , the real number a is called the real part and b is called the imaginary part. If the real part of a complex number is\u00a00, then the number is called an imaginary number or is referred to as purely imaginary; if the imaginary part is\u00a00, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a Gaussian integer. The symbol for the complex numbers is C or .\n\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that the complex numbers form an algebraically closed field, meaning that every polynomial with complex coefficients has a root in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a field, which is complete, but unlike the real numbers, it is not ordered. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that  I is greater than\u00a01, nor is there any meaning in saying that  I is less than\u00a01. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a total order that is compatible with field operations.\n\nSubclasses of the integers\n\nEven and odd numbers\n\nAn even number is an integer that is \"evenly divisible\" by two, that is divisible by two without remainder; an odd number is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term \"evenly divisible\" is now almost always shortened to \"divisible\".) Any odd number n may be constructed by the formula  for a suitable integer k. Starting with  the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number m has the form  where k is again an integer. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.\n\nPrime numbers\n\nA prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered.  The study of these questions belongs to number theory.  An example of a still unanswered question is, whether every even number is the sum of two primes.  This is called Goldbach's conjecture.\n\nThe question, whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, has been answered to the positive: this proven claim is called fundamental theorem of arithmetic. A proof appears in Euclid's Elements.\n\nOther classes of integers\nMany subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are Fibonacci numbers and perfect numbers. For more examples, see Integer sequence.\n\nSubclasses of the complex numbers\n\nAlgebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers\nAlgebraic numbers are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called transcendental numbers. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a monic polynomial equation with integer coefficients are called algebraic integers.\n\nConstructible numbers\nMotivated by the classical problems of constructions with straightedge and compass, the constructible numbers are those complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts can be constructed using straightedge and compass, starting from a given segment of unit length, in a finite number of steps.\n\nComputable numbers\n\nA computable number, also known as recursive number, is a real number such that there exists an algorithm which, given a positive number n as input, produces the first n digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using \u03bc-recursive functions, Turing machines or \u03bb-calculus. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a polynomial, and thus form a real closed field that contains the real algebraic numbers.\n\nThe computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.\n\nThe set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, almost all real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.\n\nExtensions of the concept\n\np-adic numbers\n\nThe p-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what base is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a prime number base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the p-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.\n\nThe elements of an algebraic function field over a finite field and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see Function field analogy). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The p-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.\n\nHypercomplex numbers\n\nSome number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called hypercomplex numbers. They include the quaternions H, introduced by Sir William Rowan Hamilton, in which multiplication is not commutative, the octonions, in which multiplication is not associative in addition to not being commutative, and the sedenions, in which multiplication is not alternative, neither associative nor commutative.\n\nTransfinite numbers\n\nFor dealing with infinite sets, the natural numbers have been generalized to the ordinal numbers and to the cardinal numbers. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.\n\nNonstandard numbers\nHyperreal numbers are used in non-standard analysis. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *R), denote an ordered field that is a proper extension of the ordered field of real numbers R and satisfies the transfer principle. This principle allows true first-order statements about R to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *R.\n\nSuperreal and surreal numbers extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form fields.\n\nSee also\n\n Concrete number\n List of numbers\n List of numbers in various languages\n List of types of numbers\n Mathematical constants\n Mythical numbers\n Numerical cognition\n Orders of magnitude\n Physical constants\n Pi\n Prime number\n Subitizing and counting\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Tobias Dantzig, Number, the language of science; a critical survey written for the cultured non-mathematician, New York, The Macmillan company, 1930.\n Erich Friedman, What's special about this number?\n Steven Galovich, Introduction to Mathematical Structures, Harcourt Brace Javanovich, 23 January 1989, .\n Paul Halmos, Naive Set Theory, Springer, 1974, .\n Morris Kline, Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times, Oxford University Press, 1972.\n Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, Principia Mathematica to *56, Cambridge University Press, 1910.\n George I.

{"title": "P versus NP problem", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem", "text": "thumb|250px|Diagram of complexity classes provided that P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP. The existence of problems within NP but outside both P and NP-complete, under that assumption, was established by Ladner's theorem.R. E. Ladner \"On the structure of polynomial time reducibility,\" Journal of the ACM 22, pp. 151\u2013171, 1975. Corollary 1.1. ACM site.\n\nThe P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (technically, verified in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly (again, in polynomial time).\n\nIt is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute, each of which carries a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.\n\nThe informal term quickly, used above, means the existence of an algorithm solving the task that runs in polynomial time, such that the time to complete the task varies as a polynomial function on the size of the input to the algorithm (as opposed to, say, exponential time). The general class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time is called \"class P\" or just \"P\". For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if one is provided with information showing what the answer is, it is possible to verify the answer quickly. The class of questions for which an answer can be verified in polynomial time is called NP, which stands for \"nondeterministic polynomial time\".A nondeterministic Turing machine can move to a state that is not determined by the previous state. Such a machine could solve an NP problem in polynomial time by falling into the correct answer state (by luck), then conventionally verifying it. Such machines are not practical for solving realistic problems but can be used as theoretical models.\n\nAn answer to the P\u00a0=\u00a0NP question would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. If it turned out that P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, it would mean that there are problems in NP  that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.\n\nAside from being an important problem in computational theory, a proof either way would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, algorithm research, artificial intelligence, game theory, multimedia processing, philosophy, economics and many other fields.\n\n Example \n\nConsider Sudoku, a game where the player is given a partially filled-in grid of numbers and attempts to complete the grid following certain rules. Given an incomplete Sudoku grid, of any size, is there at least one legal solution?  Any proposed solution is easily verified, and the time to check a solution grows slowly (polynomially) as the grid gets bigger.  However, all known algorithms for finding solutions take, for difficult examples, time that grows exponentially as the grid gets bigger.  So, Sudoku is in NP (quickly checkable) but does not seem to be in P (quickly solvable).  Thousands of other problems seem similar, in that they are fast to check but slow to solve.  Researchers have shown that many of the problems in NP have the extra property that a fast solution to any one of them could be used to build a quick solution to any other problem in NP, a property called NP-completeness.  Decades of searching have not yielded a fast solution to any of these problems, so most scientists suspect that none of these problems can be solved quickly.  This, however, has never been proven.\n\nHistory\n\nThe underlying issues were first discussed in the 1950s, in letters from John Forbes Nash Jr. to the National Security Agency, and from Kurt G\u00f6del to John von Neumann. The precise statement of the P versus NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper \"The complexity of theorem proving procedures\" (and independently by Leonid Levin in 1973) and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in computer science.\n\nAlthough the P versus NP problem was formally defined in 1971, there were previous inklings of the problems involved, the difficulty of proof, and the potential consequences.  In 1955, mathematician John Nash wrote a letter to the NSA, where he speculated that cracking a sufficiently complex code would require time exponential in the length of the key.   If proved (and Nash was suitably skeptical) this would imply what is now called P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, since a proposed key can easily be verified in polynomial time. Another mention of the underlying problem occurred in a 1956 letter written by Kurt G\u00f6del to John von Neumann.  G\u00f6del asked whether theorem-proving (now known to be co-NP-complete) could be solved in quadratic or linear time, and pointed out one of the most important consequences\u2014that if so, then the discovery of mathematical proofs could be automated.\n\nContext\nThe relation between the complexity classes P and NP is studied in computational complexity theory, the part of the theory of computation dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem).\n\nIn such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is deterministic (given the computer's present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and sequential (it performs actions one after the other).\n\nIn this theory, the class P consists of all those decision problems (defined below) that can be solved on a deterministic sequential machine in an amount of time that is polynomial in the size of the input; the class NP consists of all those decision problems whose positive solutions can be verified in polynomial time given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a non-deterministic machine.Sipser, Michael: Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Second Edition, International Edition, page 270. Thomson Course Technology, 2006. Definition 7.19 and Theorem 7.20. Clearly, P \u2286 NP. Arguably the biggest open question in theoretical computer science concerns the relationship between those two classes:\nIs P equal to NP?\nSince 2002, William Gasarch has conducted three polls of researchers concerning this and related questions.  Confidence that P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP has been increasing - in 2019, 88% believed P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, as opposed to 83% in 2012 and 61% in 2002.  When restricted to experts, the 2019 answers became 99% P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP.\n\nNP-completeness\nthumb|300px|right|Euler diagram for P, NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard set of problems (excluding the empty language and its complement, which belong to P but are not NP-complete)\n\nTo attack the P = NP question, the concept of NP-completeness is very useful. NP-complete problems are a set of problems to each of which any other NP-problem can be reduced in polynomial time and whose solution may still be verified in polynomial time. That is, any NP problem can be transformed into any of the NP-complete problems. Informally, an NP-complete problem is an NP problem that is at least as \"tough\" as any other problem in NP.\n\nNP-hard problems are those at least as hard as NP problems, i.e., all NP problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them. NP-hard problems need not be in NP, i.e., they need not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.\n\nFor instance, the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete by the Cook\u2013Levin theorem, so any instance of any problem in NP can be transformed mechanically into an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem in polynomial time. The Boolean satisfiability problem is one of many such NP-complete problems. If any NP-complete problem is in P, then it would follow that P = NP. However, many important problems have been shown to be NP-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known.\n\nBased on the definition alone it is not obvious that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given a description of a Turing machine M guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that M will accept? It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether M accepts the input by simulating M; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine M that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then the question of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.\n\nThe first natural problem proven to be NP-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem, also known as SAT. As noted above, this is the Cook\u2013Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is NP-complete contains technical details about Turing machines as they relate to the definition of NP. However, after this problem was proved to be NP-complete, proof by reduction provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also NP-complete, including the game Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that a solution of Sudoku in polynomial time could also be used to complete Latin squares in polynomial time.  This in turn gives a solution to the problem of partitioning tri-partite graphs into triangles, which could then be used to find solutions for the special case of SAT known as 3-SAT, which then provides a solution for general Boolean satisfiability.  So a polynomial time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of mechanical transformations, to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other NP-problem in polynomial time.  Using transformations like this, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense \"the same problem\".\n\nHarder problems\n\nAlthough it is unknown whether P = NP, problems outside of P are known. Just as the class P is defined in terms of polynomial running time, the class EXPTIME is the set of all decision problems that have exponential running time. In other words, any problem in EXPTIME is solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in O(2p(n)) time, where p(n) is a polynomial function of n. A decision problem is EXPTIME-complete if it is in EXPTIME, and every problem in EXPTIME has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to it. A number of problems are known to be EXPTIME-complete. Because it can be shown that P \u2260 EXPTIME, these problems are outside P, and so require more than polynomial time. In fact, by the time hierarchy theorem, they cannot be solved in significantly less than exponential time. Examples include finding a perfect strategy for chess positions on an N \u00d7 N board and similar problems for other board games.\n\nThe problem of deciding the truth of a statement in Presburger arithmetic requires even more time. Fischer and Rabin proved in 1974 that every algorithm that decides the truth of Presburger statements of length n has a runtime of at least  for some constant c. Hence, the problem is known to need more than exponential run time. Even more difficult are the undecidable problems, such as the halting problem. They cannot be completely solved by any algorithm, in the sense that for any particular algorithm there is at least one input for which that algorithm will not produce the right answer; it will either produce the wrong answer, finish without giving a conclusive answer, or otherwise run forever without producing any answer at all.\n\nIt is also possible to consider questions other than decision problems.  One such class, consisting of counting problems, is called #P: whereas an NP problem asks \"Are there any solutions?\", the corresponding #P problem asks \"How many solutions are there?\"  Clearly, a #P problem must be at least as hard as the corresponding NP problem, since a count of solutions immediately tells if at least one solution exists, if the count is greater than zero. Surprisingly, some #P problems that are believed to be difficult correspond to easy (for example linear-time) P problems.  For these problems, it is very easy to tell whether solutions exist, but thought to be very hard to tell how many.  Many of these problems are #P-complete, and hence among the hardest problems in #P, since a polynomial time solution to any of them would allow a polynomial time solution to all other #P problems.\n\nProblems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete\n\nIn 1975, Richard E. Ladner showed that if P \u2260 NP then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete. Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems. The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete.\n\nThe graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai and Eugene Luks, has run time 2O() for graphs with n vertices.\n\nThe integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UPLance Fortnow. Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring. 13 September 2002.). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP = co-NP). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes expected time\n\nto factor an n-bit integer. However, the best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor's algorithm, does run in polynomial time, although this does not indicate where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.\n\nDoes P mean \"easy\"?\nthumb|310 px|The graph shows time (average of 100 instances in ms using a 933 MHz Pentium III) vs.problem size for knapsack problems for a state-of-the-art specialized algorithm. Quadratic fit suggests that empirical algorithmic complexity for instances with 50\u201310,000 variables is O((log(n))2).Pisinger, D. 2003. \"Where are the hard knapsack problems?\" Technical Report 2003/08, Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark\nAll of the above discussion has assumed that P means \"easy\" and \"not in P\" means \"hard\", an assumption known as Cobham's thesis. It is a common and reasonably accurate assumption in complexity theory; however, it has some caveats.\n\nFirst, it is not always true in practice. A theoretical polynomial algorithm may have extremely large constant factors or exponents thus rendering it impractical. On the other hand, even if a problem is shown to be NP-complete, and even if P \u2260 NP, there may still be effective approaches to tackling the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many NP-complete problems, such as the knapsack problem, the traveling salesman problem and the Boolean satisfiability problem, that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical average-case complexity (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low.  An example is the simplex algorithm in linear programming, which works surprisingly well in practice; despite having exponential worst-case time complexity it runs on par with the best known polynomial-time algorithms.\n\nSecond, there are types of computations which do not conform to the Turing machine model on which P and NP are defined, such as quantum computation and randomized algorithms.\n\nReasons to believe P \u2260 NP\nAccording to polls, most computer scientists believe that P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems no one has been able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3000 important known NP-complete problems (see List of NP-complete problems). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P = NP would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as NP = co-NP and P = PH.\n\nIt is also intuitively argued that the existence of problems that are hard to solve but for which the solutions are easy to verify matches real-world experience., point 9.\n\nOn the other hand, some researchers believe that there is overconfidence in believing P \u2260 NP and that researchers should explore proofs of P = NP as well. For example, in 2002 these statements were made:\n\nConsequences of solution\nOne of the reasons the problem attracts so much attention is the consequences of the answer.  Either direction of resolution would advance theory enormously, and perhaps have huge practical consequences as well.\n\nP = NP\nA proof that P = NP could have stunning practical consequences if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving some of the important problems in NP. It is also possible that a proof would not lead directly to efficient methods, perhaps if the proof is non-constructive, or the size of the bounding polynomial is too big to be efficient in practice. The consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various NP-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.\n\nCryptography, for example, relies on certain problems being difficult. A constructive and efficient solutionExactly how efficient a solution must be to pose a threat to cryptography depends on the details.  A solution of  with a reasonable constant term would be disastrous.  On the other hand, a solution that is  in almost all cases would not pose an immediate practical danger. to an NP-complete problem such as 3-SAT would break most existing cryptosystems including:\n Existing implementations of public-key cryptography,See  for a reduction of factoring to SAT.  A 512 bit factoring problem (8400 MIPS-years when factored) translates to a SAT problem of 63,652 variables and 406,860 clauses. a foundation for many modern security applications such as secure financial transactions over the Internet.\n Symmetric ciphers such as AES or 3DES,See, for example,  in which an instance of DES is encoded as a SAT problem with 10336 variables and 61935 clauses.  A 3DES problem instance would be about 3 times this size. used for the encryption of communications data.\n Cryptographic hashing as the problem of finding a pre-image that hashes to a given value must be difficult in order to be useful, and ideally should require exponential time. However, if P=NP, then finding a pre-image M can be done in polynomial time, through reduction to SAT.\nThese would need to be modified or replaced by information-theoretically secure solutions not inherently based on P-NP equivalence.\n\nOn the other hand, there are enormous positive consequences that would follow from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems. For instance, many problems in operations research are NP-complete, such as some types of integer programming and the travelling salesman problem. Efficient solutions to these problems would have enormous implications for logistics. Many other important problems, such as some problems in protein structure prediction, are also NP-complete; if these problems were efficiently solvable it could spur considerable advances in life sciences and biotechnology.\n\nBut such changes may pale in significance compared to the revolution an efficient method for solving NP-complete problems would cause in mathematics itself. G\u00f6del, in his early thoughts on computational complexity, noted that a mechanical method that could solve any problem would revolutionize mathematics:History of this letter and its translation from  From pages 359\u2013376 of Optimization Stories, M. Gr\u00f6tschel (editor), a special issue of \u00a8 Documenta Mathematica, published in August 2012 and distributed to attendees at the 21st International Symposium on Mathematical Programming in Berlin.\n\nSimilarly, Stephen Cook says\n\nResearch mathematicians spend their careers trying to prove theorems, and some proofs have taken decades or even centuries to find after problems have been stated\u2014for instance, Fermat's Last Theorem took over three centuries to prove. A method that is guaranteed to find proofs to theorems, should one exist of a \"reasonable\" size, would essentially end this struggle.\n\nDonald Knuth has stated that he has come to believe that P = NP, but is reserved about the impact of a possible proof:\n\nP \u2260 NP\nA proof that showed that P \u2260 NP would lack the practical computational benefits of a proof that P = NP, but would nevertheless represent a very significant advance in computational complexity theory and provide guidance for future research. It would allow one to show in a formal way that many common problems cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in P \u2260 NP, much of this focusing of research has already taken place.\n\nAlso P \u2260 NP still leaves open the average-case complexity of hard problems in NP.  For example, it is possible that SAT requires exponential time in the worst case, but that almost all randomly selected instances of it are efficiently solvable. Russell Impagliazzo has described five hypothetical \"worlds\" that could result from different possible resolutions to the average-case complexity question.R. Impagliazzo, \"A personal view of average-case complexity,\" sct, pp.134, 10th Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference (SCT'95), 1995  These range from \"Algorithmica\", where P = NP and problems like SAT can be solved efficiently in all instances, to \"Cryptomania\", where P \u2260 NP and generating hard instances of problems outside P is easy, with three intermediate possibilities reflecting different possible distributions of difficulty over instances of NP-hard problems.  The \"world\" where P \u2260 NP but all problems in NP are tractable in the average case is called \"Heuristica\" in the paper. A Princeton University workshop in 2009 studied the status of the five worlds.\n\nResults about difficulty of proof\nAlthough the P = NP problem itself remains open despite a million-dollar prize and a huge amount of dedicated research, efforts to solve the problem have led to several new techniques.  In particular, some of the most fruitful research related to the P = NP problem has been in showing that existing proof techniques are not powerful enough to answer the question, thus suggesting that novel technical approaches are required.\n\nAs additional evidence for the difficulty of the problem, essentially all known proof techniques in computational complexity theory fall into one of the following classifications, each of which is known to be insufficient to prove that P \u2260 NP:\nClassificationDefinitionRelativizing proofsImagine a world where every algorithm is allowed to make queries to some fixed subroutine called an oracle (a black box which can answer a fixed set of questions in constant time, such as a black box that solves any given traveling salesman problem in 1 step), and the running time of the oracle is not counted against the running time of the algorithm. Most proofs (especially classical ones) apply uniformly in a world with oracles regardless of what the oracle does. These proofs are called relativizing. In 1975, Baker, Gill, and Solovay showed that P = NP with respect to some oracles, while P \u2260 NP for other oracles. Since relativizing proofs can only prove statements that are uniformly true with respect to all possible oracles, this showed that relativizing techniques cannot resolve P = NP.Natural proofsIn 1993, Alexander Razborov and Steven Rudich defined a general class of proof techniques for circuit complexity lower bounds, called natural proofs. At the time all previously known circuit lower bounds were natural, and circuit complexity was considered a very promising approach for resolving P = NP. However, Razborov and Rudich showed that, if one-way functions exist, then no natural proof method can distinguish between P and NP. Although one-way functions have never been formally proven to exist, most mathematicians believe that they do, and a proof of their existence would be a much stronger statement than P \u2260 NP. Thus it is unlikely that natural proofs alone can resolve P = NP.Algebrizing proofsAfter the Baker-Gill-Solovay result, new non-relativizing proof techniques were successfully used to prove that IP = PSPACE. However, in 2008, Scott Aaronson and Avi Wigderson showed that the main technical tool used in the IP = PSPACE proof, known as arithmetization, was also insufficient to resolve P = NP.\n\nThese barriers are another reason why NP-complete problems are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm can be demonstrated for an NP-complete problem, this would solve the P = NP problem in a way not excluded by the above results.\n\nThese barriers have also led some computer scientists to suggest that the P versus NP problem may be independent of standard axiom systems like ZFC (cannot be proved or disproved within them). The interpretation of an independence result could be that either no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any NP-complete problem, and such a proof cannot be constructed in (e.g.) ZFC, or that polynomial-time algorithms for NP-complete problems may exist, but it is impossible to prove in ZFC that such algorithms are correct.. However, if it can be shown, using techniques of the sort that are currently known to be applicable, that the problem cannot be decided even with much weaker assumptions extending the Peano axioms (PA) for integer arithmetic, then there would necessarily exist nearly-polynomial-time algorithms for every problem in NP.. Therefore, if one believes (as most complexity theorists do) that not all problems in NP have efficient algorithms, it would follow that proofs of independence using those techniques cannot be possible. Additionally, this result implies that proving independence from PA or ZFC using currently known techniques is no easier than proving the existence of efficient algorithms for all problems in NP.\n\nClaimed solutions \nWhile the P versus NP problem is generally considered unsolved, many amateur and some professional researchers have claimed solutions. Gerhard J. Woeginger maintains a list that, as of 2018, contains 62 purported proofs of P = NP, 50 of P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, 2 proofs the problem is unprovable, and one proof that it is undecidable.  An August 2010 claim of proof that P \u2260 NP, by Vinay Deolalikar, a researcher at HP Labs, received heavy Internet and press attention after two leading specialists described it as \" to be a relatively serious attempt\". The proof has been reviewed publicly by academics,Science News, \"Crowdsourcing peer review\" and Neil Immerman, an expert in the field, has pointed out two possibly fatal errors in the proof.\nIn September 2010, Deolalikar was reported to be working on a detailed expansion of his attempted proof. However, opinions expressed by several notable theoretical computer scientists indicate that the attempted proof is neither correct nor a significant advancement in the understanding of the problem.G\u00f6del\u2019s Lost Letter and P=NP, Update on Deolalikar\u2019s Proof that P\u2260NP  This assessment prompted a May 2013 article in The New Yorker to call the proof attempt \"thoroughly discredited\".\n\nLogical characterizations\nThe P = NP problem can be restated in terms of expressible certain classes of logical statements, as a result of work in descriptive complexity.\n\nConsider all languages of finite structures with a fixed signature including a linear order relation. Then, all such languages in P can be expressed in first-order logic with the addition of a suitable least fixed-point combinator. Effectively, this, in combination with the order, allows the definition of recursive functions. As long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished order relation, so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure, this precisely characterizes P.\n\nSimilarly, NP is the set of languages expressible in existential second-order logic\u2014that is, second-order logic restricted to exclude universal quantification over relations, functions, and subsets. The languages in the polynomial hierarchy, PH, correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question \"is P a proper subset of NP\" can be reformulated as \"is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with least fixed point cannot?\".Elvira Mayordomo. \"P versus NP\"  Monograf\u00edas de la Real Academia de Ciencias de Zaragoza 26: 57\u201368 (2004). The word \"existential\" can even be dropped from the previous characterization, since P = NP if and only if P = PH (as the former would establish that NP = co-NP, which in turn implies that NP = PH).\n\nPolynomial-time algorithms\nNo algorithm for any NP-complete problem is known to run in polynomial time. However, there are algorithms known for NP-complete problems with the property that if P = NP, then the algorithm runs in polynomial time on accepting instances (although with enormous constants, making the algorithm impractical). However, these algorithms do not qualify as polynomial time because their running time on rejecting instances are not polynomial. The following algorithm, due to Levin (without any citation), is such an example below. It correctly accepts the NP-complete language SUBSET-SUM. It runs in polynomial time on inputs that are in SUBSET-SUM if and only if P = NP:\n\n // Algorithm that accepts the NP-complete language SUBSET-SUM.\n //\n // this is a polynomial-time algorithm if and only if P = NP.\n //\n // \"Polynomial-time\" means it returns \"yes\" in polynomial time when\n // the answer should be \"yes\", and runs forever when it is \"no\".\n //\n // Input: S = a finite set of integers\n // Output: \"yes\" if any subset of S adds up to 0.\n // Runs forever with no output otherwise.\n // Note: \"Program number M\" is the program obtained by\n // writing the integer M in binary, then\n // considering that string of bits to be a\n // program. Every possible program can be\n // generated this way, though most do nothing\n // because of syntax errors. FOR K = 1...\u221e\n   FOR M = 1...K\n     Run program number M for K steps with input S\n     IF the program outputs a list of distinct integers\n       AND the integers are all in S\n       AND the integers sum to 0\n     THEN\n       OUTPUT \"yes\" and HALT\n\nIf, and only if, P = NP, then this is a polynomial-time algorithm accepting an NP-complete language. \"Accepting\" means it gives \"yes\" answers in polynomial time, but is allowed to run forever when the answer is \"no\" (also known as a semi-algorithm).\n\nThis algorithm is enormously impractical, even if P = NP. If the shortest program that can solve SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time is b bits long, the above algorithm will try at least  other programs first.\n\nFormal definitions\n\nP and NP\nConceptually speaking, a decision problem is a problem that takes as input some string w over an alphabet \u03a3, and outputs \"yes\" or \"no\". If there is an algorithm (say a Turing machine, or a computer program with unbounded memory) that can produce the correct answer for any input string of length n in at most cnk steps, where k and c are constants independent of the input string, then we say that the problem can be solved in polynomial time and we place it in the class P. Formally, P is defined as the set of all languages that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. That is,\n\nwhere\n\nand a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine M that satisfies the following two conditions:\n\n M halts on all inputs w and\n there exists  such that , where O refers to the big O notation and\n\nNP can be defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machines (the traditional way). However, a modern approach to define NP is to use the concept of certificate and verifier. Formally, NP is defined as the set of languages over a finite alphabet that have a verifier that runs in polynomial time, where the notion of \"verifier\" is defined as follows.\n\nLet L be a language over a finite alphabet, \u03a3.L \u2208 NP if, and only if, there exists a binary relation  and a positive integer k such that the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n For all ,  such that (x, y) \u2208 R and ; and\n the language  over  is decidable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.\n\nA Turing machine that decides LR is called a verifier for L and a y such that (x, y) \u2208 R is called a certificate of membership of x in L.\n\nIn general, a verifier does not have to be polynomial-time. However, for L to be in NP, there must be a verifier that runs in polynomial time.\n\nExample\nLet\n\nClearly, the question of whether a given x is a composite is equivalent to the question of whether x is a member of COMPOSITE. It can be shown that COMPOSITE \u2208 NP by verifying that it satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).\n\nCOMPOSITE also happens to be in P, a fact demonstrated by the invention of the AKS primality test.\n\nNP-completeness\n\nThere are many equivalent ways of describing NP-completeness.\n\nLet L be a language over a finite alphabet \u03a3.L is NP-complete if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n L \u2208 NP; and\n any L\u2032 in NP is polynomial-time-reducible to L (written as ), where  if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:\n There exists f : \u03a3* \u2192 \u03a3* such that for all w in \u03a3* we have: ; and\n there exists a polynomial-time Turing machine that halts with f(w) on its tape on any input w.\n\nAlternatively, if L \u2208 NP, and there is another NP-complete problem that can be polynomial-time reduced to L, then L is NP-complete. This is a common way of proving some new problem is NP-complete.\n\nPopular culture\nThe film Travelling Salesman, by director Timothy Lanzone, is the story of four mathematicians hired by the US government to solve the P versus NP problem.\n\nIn the sixth episode of The Simpsons seventh season \"Treehouse of Horror VI\", the equation P=NP is seen shortly after Homer accidentally stumbles into the \"third dimension\".\n\nIn the second episode of season 2 of Elementary'', \"Solve for X\" revolves around Sherlock and Watson investigating the murders of mathematicians who were attempting to solve P versus NP.\n\nSee also\n Game complexity\n List of unsolved problems in mathematics\n Unique games conjecture\n Unsolved problems in computer science\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n  Online drafts\n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n\n Aviad Rubinstein's Hardness of Approximation Between P and NP, winner of the ACM's 2017 Doctoral Dissertation Award.\n\nCategory:1956 in computer science\nCategory:Structural complexity theory\nCategory:Mathematical optimization\nCategory:Conjectures\nCategory:Unsolved problems in mathematics\nCategory:Unsolved problems in computer science\nCategory:Millennium Prize Problems\nCategory:Computer-related introductions in 1956"}
{"title": "Pattern hair loss", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss", "text": "Pattern hair loss, known as male-pattern hair loss (MPHL) when it affects males and female-pattern hair loss (FPHL) when it affects females, is hair loss that primarily affects the top and front of the scalp. In males, the hair loss often presents itself as a receding hairline, while in females, it typically presents as a thinning of the hair.\n\nMale pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.\n\nManagement may include simply accepting the condition. Otherwise, treatments may include minoxidil, finasteride, or hair transplant surgery. Evidence for finasteride in women is poor and it may result in birth defects if taken during pregnancy.\n\nPattern hair loss by the age of 50 affects about half of males and a quarter of females. It is the most common cause of hair loss.  \n\nSigns and symptoms\nClassic male-pattern hair loss begins above the temples and vertex (calvaria) of the scalp. As it progresses, a rim of hair at the sides and rear of the head remains. This has been referred to as a 'Hippocratic wreath', and rarely progresses to complete baldness. Pattern hair loss is classified as a form of non-scarring hair loss. The Hamilton\u2013Norwood scale has been developed to grade androgenic alopecia in males.\n\nFemale-pattern hair loss more often causes diffuse thinning without hairline recession; similar to its male counterpart, female androgenic alopecia rarely leads to total hair loss. The Ludwig scale grades severity of female-pattern hair loss.\n\nCauses\n\nHormones\nthumb|right|Androgens can interact with the Wnt signalling pathway to cause hair loss\n\nKRT37 is the only keratin that is regulated by androgens. This sensitivity to androgens was acquired by Homo sapiens and is not shared with their great ape cousins. Although Winter et. al found that KRT37 is expressed in all the hair follices of chimpanzees, it was not detected in the head hair of modern humans. As androgens are known to grow hair on the body but decrease it on the scalp, this lack of scalp KRT37 may help explain the paradoxical nature of Androgenic alopecia as well as the fact that head hair anagen cycles are extremely long.\n\nResearch indicates that the initial programming of pilosebaceous units of hair follicles begins in utero. The physiology is primarily androgenic, with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) being the major contributor at the dermal papillae. Men with premature androgenic alopecia tend to have lower than normal values of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and epitestosterone when compared to men without pattern hair loss. Although hair follicles were previously thought to be permanently gone in areas of complete hair loss, they are more likely dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the stem cell progenitor cells from which the follicles arose.\n\nTransgenic studies have shown that growth and dormancy of hair follicles are related to the activity of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) at the dermal papillae, which is affected by DHT. Androgens are important in male sexual development around birth and at puberty. They regulate sebaceous glands, apocrine hair growth, and libido. With increasing age, androgens stimulate hair growth on the face, but can suppress it at the temples and scalp vertex, a condition that has been referred to as the 'androgen paradox'.\n\nMen with androgenic alopecia typically have higher 5-alpha-reductase, lower total testosterone, higher unbound/free testosterone, and higher free androgens, including DHT. 5-alpha-reductase converts free testosterone into DHT, and is highest in the scalp and prostate gland.  DHT is most commonly formed at the tissue level by 5\u03b1-reduction of testosterone. The genetic corollary that codes for this enzyme has been discovered. Prolactin has also been suggested to have different effects on the hair follicle across gender.\n\nAlso, crosstalk occurs between androgens and the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway that leads to hair loss. At the level of the somatic stem cell, androgens promote differentiation of facial hair dermal papillae, but inhibit it at the scalp. Other research suggests the enzyme prostaglandin D2 synthase and its product prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in hair follicles as contributive.\n\nThese observations have led to study at the level of the mesenchymal dermal papillae.Types 1 and 2 5\u03b1 reductase enzymes are present at pilosebaceous units in papillae of individual hair follicles. They catalyze formation of the androgens testosterone and DHT, which in turn regulate hair growth. Androgens have different effects at different follicles: they stimulate IGF-1 at facial hair, leading to growth, but can also stimulate TGF \u03b21, TGF \u03b22, dickkopf1, and IL-6 at the scalp, leading to catagenic miniaturization. Hair follicles in anaphase express four different caspases. Significant levels of inflammatory infiltrate have been found in transitional  hair  follicles. Interleukin 1 is suspected to be a cytokine mediator that promotes hair loss.\n\nThe fact that hair loss is cumulative with age while androgen levels fall as well as the fact that finasteride does not reverse advanced stages of androgenetic alopecia remains a mystery but some possible explanations have been put forward:  Higher conversion of testosterone to DHT locally with age as higher levels of 5-alpha reductase are noted in balding scalp, and higher levels of DNA damage in the dermal papilla as well as senescence of the dermal papilla due to androgen receptor activation and environmental stress. The mechanism by which the androgen receptor triggers dermal papilla permanent senescence is not known but may involve IL6, TGFB-1 and oxidative stress. Senescence of the dermal papilla is measured by lack of mobility, different size and shape, lower replication and altered output of molecules and different expression of markers.  The dermal papilla is the primary location of androgen action and its migration towards the hair bulge and subsequent signaling and size increase are required to maintain the hair follicle so senescence via the androgen receptor explains much of the physiology.\n\nthumb|left|Hair follicle and mesenchymal dermal papilla, labelled at top\n\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of androgenic alopecia can be usually established based on clinical presentation in men. In women, the diagnosis usually requires more complex diagnostic evaluation. Further evaluation of the differential requires exclusion of other causes of hair loss, and assessing for the typical progressive hair loss pattern of androgenic alopecia.Diagnosing Men's Hair Loss: Norwood Scale Chart. Webmd.com (2010-03-01). Retrieved on 2010-11-28. Trichoscopy can be used for further evaluation.  Biopsy may be needed to exclude other causes of hair loss, and histology would demonstrate perifollicular fibrosis.\n\nTreatment\n\nAndrogen-dependent\n\nFinasteride is a medication of the 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) class. By inhibiting type II 5-AR, finasteride prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in various tissues including the scalp. Increased hair on the scalp can be seen within three months of starting finasteride treatment and longer-term studies have demonstrated increased hair on the scalp at 24 and 48 months with continued use. Treatment with finasteride more effectively treats male-pattern hair loss at the vertex than male-pattern hair loss at the front of the head and temples.\n\nDutasteride is a medication in the same class as finasteride but inhibits both type I and type II 5-alpha reductase. Dutasteride is approved for the treatment of male-pattern hair loss in Korea and Japan, but not in the United States. However, it is commonly used off-label to treat male-pattern hair loss.\n\nAndrogen-independent\n\nMinoxidil dilates small blood vessels; it is not clear how this causes hair to grow.  Other treatments include tretinoin combined with minoxidil, ketoconazole shampoo, dermarolling (Collagen induction therapy) spironolactone, alfatradiol, and topilutamide (fluridil).\n\n Female pattern \n\nThere is evidence supporting the use of minoxidil as a safe and effective treatment for female pattern hair loss, and there is no significant difference in efficacy between 2% and 5% formulations. Finasteride was shown to be no more effective than placebo based on low-quality studies. The effectiveness of laser based therapies is unclear.\n\nProcedures\nMore advanced cases may be resistant or unresponsive to medical therapy and require hair transplantation.  Naturally occurring units of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are excised and moved to areas of hair restoration. These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in close proximity and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained from either follicular unit transplantation (FUT) or follicular unit extraction (FUE). In the former, a strip of skin with follicular units is extracted and dissected into individual follicular unit grafts, and in the latter individual hairs are extracted manually or robotically (with the FDA cleared ARTAS system). The surgeon then implants the grafts into small incisions, called recipient sites. Cosmetic scalp tattoos can also mimic the appearance of a short, buzzed haircut.\n\nAlternative therapies\nMany people use unproven treatments. Regarding female pattern alopecia, there is no evidence for vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. As of 2008, there is little evidence to support the use of lasers to treat male-pattern hair loss. The same applies to special lights. Dietary supplements are not typically recommended. A 2015 review found a growing number of papers in which plant extracts were studied but only one randomized controlled clinical trial, namely a study in 10 people of saw palmetto extract.\n\nPrognosis\n\nPsychological\nAndrogenic alopecia is typically experienced as a \"moderately stressful condition that diminishes body image satisfaction\". However, although most men regard baldness as an unwanted and distressing experience, they usually are able to cope and retain integrity of personality.\n\nAlthough baldness is not as common in women as in men, the psychological effects of hair loss tend to be much greater. Typically, the frontal hairline is preserved, but the density of hair is decreased on all areas of the scalp. Previously, it was believed to be caused by testosterone just as in male baldness, but most women who lose hair have normal testosterone levels.\n\nEpidemiology\nFemale androgenic alopecia has become a growing problem that, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, affects around 30\u00a0million women in the United States. Although hair loss in females normally occurs after the age of 50 or even later when it does not follow events like pregnancy, chronic illness, crash diets, and stress among others, it is now occurring at earlier ages with reported cases in women as young as 15 or 16.\n\nSociety and culture\nthumb|right|Certain studies have suggested androgenic alopecia conveys survival advantage.\nStudies have been inconsistent and not stable across cultures how balding men rate on the attraction scale. While a study from South Korea showed most people rated balding men as less attractive, a more recent survey of 1,000 Welsh women rated bald and gray haired men quite desirable.\n\nProposed social theories for male-pattern hair loss include that baldness signaled dominance, social status, or longevity. Biologists have hypothesized the larger sunlight exposed area would allow more vitamin D to be synthesized, which might have been a \"finely tuned mechanism to prevent prostate cancer\", as the malignancy itself is also associated with higher levels of DHT. However, this argument is weak considering the fact that baldness is very rare in East Asians. As well, early hominins such as the Neandertals do not possess any of the balding variants on the various association loci, who presumably would have been under positive selection for increased Vitamin D synthesis.\n\nMyths\nthumb|An ancient phenomenon:Greek philosophers with and without much hair (from left to right: Socrates, Antisthenes, Chrysippus, and Epicurus, fifth to third centuries BC)\n\nMany myths exist regarding the possible causes of baldness and its relationship with one's virility, intelligence, ethnicity, job, social class, wealth, and many other characteristics.\n\n Baldness is inherited from the mother's father \nA 50% chance exists for a person to share the same X chromosome as his maternal grandfather. Because women have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of the androgen receptor gene, while men only have one.\n\n Weight training and other types of physical activity cause baldness \nBecause it increases testosterone levels, many Internet forums have put forward the idea that weight training and other forms of exercise increase hair loss in predisposed individuals.  Although scientific studies do support a correlation between exercise and testosterone, no direct study has found a link between exercise and baldness. However, a few have found a relationship between a sedentary life and baldness, suggesting some exercise is beneficial. The type or quantity of exercise may influence hair loss.\nTestosterone levels are not a good marker of baldness, and many studies actually show paradoxical low testosterone in balding persons, although research on the implications is limited.\n\n Baldness can be caused by emotional stress, sleep deprivation, etc. \nEmotional stress has been shown to accelerate baldness in genetically susceptible individuals.\nStress due to sleep deprivation in military recruits lowered testosterone levels, but is not noted to have affected SHBG. Thus, stress due to sleep deprivation in fit males is unlikely to elevate DHT, which is one cause of male pattern baldness. Whether sleep deprivation can cause hair loss by some other mechanism is not clear.\n\n Bald men are more 'virile' or sexually active than others \nLevels of free testosterone are strongly linked to libido and DHT levels, but unless free testosterone is virtually nonexistent, levels have not been shown to affect virility. Men with androgenic alopecia are more likely to have a higher baseline of free androgens. However, sexual activity is multifactoral, and androgenic profile is not the only determining factor in baldness. Additionally, because hair loss is progressive and free testosterone declines with age, a male's hairline may be more indicative of his past than his present disposition.\n\n Frequent ejaculation causes baldness \nMany misconceptions exist about what can help prevent hair loss, one of these being that lack of sexual activity will automatically prevent hair loss. While a proven direct correlation exists between increased frequency of ejaculation and increased levels of DHT, as shown in a recent study by Harvard Medical School, the study suggests that ejaculation frequency may be a sign, rather than a cause, of higher DHT levels. Another study shows that although sexual arousal and masturbation-induced orgasm increase testosterone concentration around orgasm, they reduce testosterone concentration on average (especially before abstinence) and because about 5% of testosterone is converted to DHT, ejaculation does not elevate DHT levels.\n\nThe only published study to test correlation between ejaculation frequency and baldness was probably large enough to detect an association (1390 subjects) and found no correlation, although persons with only vertex androgenetic alopecia had fewer female sexual partners than those of other androgenetic alopecia categories (such as frontal or both frontal and vertex). One study may not be enough, especially in baldness, where there is a complex with age. Marital status has been shown in some studies to influence hair loss in cross-sectional studies (NHANES1), although the direction of effect cannot be inferred from a cross sectional study.\n\nNames\nMale pattern hair loss is also known as androgenic alopecia, androgenetic alopecia (AGA), alopecia androgenetica, and male pattern baldness (MPB).\n\nOther animals\nAnimal models of androgenic alopecia occur naturally and have been developed in transgenic mice; chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes); bald uakaris (Cacajao rubicundus); and stump-tailed macaques (Macaca speciosa and M. arctoides). Of these, macaques have demonstrated the greatest incidence and most prominent degrees of hair loss.\n\nBaldness is not a trait unique to human beings. One possible case study is about a maneless male lion in the Tsavo area. The Tsavo lion prides are unique in that they frequently have only a single male lion with usually seven or eight adult females, as opposed to four females in other lion prides. Male lions may have heightened levels of testosterone, which could explain their reputation for aggression and dominance, indicating that lack of mane may at one time have had an alpha correlation.\n\nAlthough primates do not go bald, their hairlines do undergo recession. In infancy the hairline starts at the top of the supraorbital ridge, but slowly recedes after puberty to create the appearance of a small forehead.\n\nReferences\n\n External links \n\n NLM- Genetics Home Reference\n \n\nCategory:Genetic disorders with no OMIM\nCategory:Conditions of the skin appendages\nCategory:Human hair\nCategory:Hair diseases\nCategory:Testosterone"}

It is often motivated informally, usually by an appeal to intuition and everyday experience. In an axiomatic theory, relations between primitive notions are restricted by axioms.More generally, in a formal system, rules restrict the use of primitive notions. See e.g. MU puzzle for a non-logical formal system. Some authors refer to the latter as \"defining\" primitive notions by one or more axioms, but this can be misleading. Formal theories cannot dispense with primitive notions, under pain of infinite regress.\n\nFor example, in contemporary geometry, point, line, and contains are some primitive notions. Instead of attempting to define them,Euclid (300 B.C.) still gave definitions in his Elements, like \"A line is breadthless length\". their interplay is ruled (in Hilbert's axiom system) by axioms like \"For every two points there exists a line that contains them both\".This axiom can be formalized in predicate logic as \"\u2200x1,x2\u2208P. \u2203y\u2208L. C(y,x1) \u2227 C(y,x2)\", where P, L, and C denotes the set of points, of lines, and the \"contains\" relation, respectively.\n\nDetails\nAlfred Tarski explained the role of primitive notions as follows:Alfred Tarski (1946) Introduction to Logic and the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences, p. 118, Oxford University Press.\nWhen we set out to construct a given discipline, we distinguish, first of all, a certain small group of expressions of this discipline that seem to us to be immediately understandable; the expressions in this group we call PRIMITIVE TERMS or UNDEFINED TERMS, and we employ them without explaining their meanings. At the same time we adopt the principle: not to employ any of the other expressions of the discipline under consideration, unless its meaning has first been determined with the help of primitive terms and of such expressions of the discipline whose meanings have been explained previously. The sentence which determines the meaning of a term in this way is called a DEFINITION,...\n\nAn inevitable regress to primitive notions in the theory of knowledge was explained by Gilbert de B. Robinson:\nTo a non-mathematician it often comes as a surprise that it is impossible to define explicitly all the terms which are used. This is not a superficial problem but lies at the root of all knowledge; it is necessary to begin somewhere, and to make progress one must clearly state those elements and relations which are undefined and those properties which are taken for granted.Gilbert de B. Robinson (1959) Foundations of Geometry, 4th ed., p. 8, University of Toronto Press\n\nExamples\nThe necessity for primitive notions is illustrated in several axiomatic foundations in mathematics:\n Set theory: The concept of the set is an example of a primitive notion. As Mary Tiles writes:Mary Tiles (2004) The Philosophy of Set Theory, p. 99 [The] 'definition' of 'set' is less a definition than an attempt at explication of something which is being given the status of a primitive, undefined, term. As evidence, she quotes Felix Hausdorff: \"A set is formed by the grouping together of single objects into a whole. A set is a plurality thought of as a unit.\"\n Naive set theory: The empty set is a primitive notion. To assert that it exists would be an implicit axiom.\n Peano arithmetic: The successor function and the number zero are primitive notions. Since Peano arithmetic is useful in regards to properties of the numbers, the objects that the primitive notions represent may not strictly matter.\n Axiomatic systems: The primitive notions will depend upon the set of axioms chosen for the system.  Alessandro Padoa discussed this selection at the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in 1900.Alessandro Padoa (1900) \"Logical introduction to any deductive theory\" in Jean van Heijenoort (1967) A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879\u20131931, Harvard University Press 118\u201323 The notions themselves may not necessarily need to be stated; Susan Haack (1978) writes, \"A set of axioms is sometimes said to give an implicit definition of its primitive terms.\"\n Euclidean geometry: Under Hilbert's axiom system the primitive notions are point, line, plane, congruence, betweeness, and incidence.\n Euclidean geometry: Under Peano's axiom system the primitive notions are point, segment, and motion.\n Philosophy of mathematics: Bertrand Russell considered the \"indefinables of mathematics\" to build the case for logicism in his book The Principles of Mathematics (1903).\n\nSee also\nAxiomatic set theory\nFoundations of geometry\nFoundations of mathematics\nMathematical logic\nNotion (philosophy)\nObject theory\nNatural semantic metalanguage\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Philosophy of logic\nCategory:Set theory\nCategory:Concepts in logic"}
{"title": "Primitive recursive function", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function", "text": "In computability theory, primitive recursive functions are a class of functions that are defined using composition and primitive recursion \u2013 described below \u2013 as central operations. They are a strict subset of those \u00b5-recursive functions (also called partial recursive functions) which are also total functions. Primitive recursive functions form an important building block on the way to a full formalization of computability.  These functions are also important in proof theory.\n\nMost of the functions normally studied in number theory are primitive recursive. For example, addition and division, the factorial and exponential function, and the function which returns the nth prime are all primitive recursive. So are many approximations to real-valued functions.Brainerd and Landweber, 1974 In fact, it is difficult to devise a total recursive function that is not primitive recursive, although some are known (see the section on Limitations below).\nThe set of primitive recursive functions is known as PR in computational complexity theory.\n\n Definition \nThe primitive recursive functions are among the number-theoretic functions, which are functions from the natural numbers (nonnegative integers) {0, 1, 2, ...} to the natural numbers. These functions take n arguments for some natural number n and are called n-ary.\n\nThe basic primitive recursive functions are given by these axioms:\n\nMore complex primitive recursive functions can be obtained by applying the operations given by these axioms:\n\nExample. We take f(x) as the S(x) defined above. This f is a 1-ary primitive recursive function. And so is g(x) = S(x). So h(x) defined as f(g(x)) = S(S(x)) is a primitive recursive 1-ary function too. Informally speaking, h(x) is the function that turns x into x+2.\n\nExample. Suppose f(x) = P11(x) = x and g(x,y,z)= S(P23(x,y,z)) = S(y). Then h(0,x) = x and h(S(y),x) = g(y,h(y,x),x) = S(h(y,x)). Now h(0,1) = 1, h(1,1) = S(h(0,1)) = 2, h(2,1) = S(h(1,1)) = 3. This h is a 2-ary primitive recursive function. We can call it 'addition'.\n\nInterpretation. The function h acts as a For loop from 0 up to the value of its first argument. The rest of the arguments for h, denoted here with xi\u2019s (i = 1, ..., k), are a set of initial conditions for the For loop which may be used by it during calculations but which are immutable by it. The functions f and g on the right side of the equations which define h represent the body of the loop, which performs calculations. Function f is only used once to perform initial calculations. Calculations for subsequent steps of the loop are performed by g. The first parameter of g is fed the \u201ccurrent\u201d value of the For loop\u2019s index. The second parameter of g is fed the result of the For loop\u2019s previous calculations, from previous steps. The rest of the parameters for g are those immutable initial conditions for the For loop mentioned earlier. They may be used by g to perform calculations but they will not themselves be altered by g.\n\nThe primitive recursive functions are the basic functions and those obtained from the basic functions by applying these operations a finite number of times.\n\n Role of the projection functions \nThe projection functions can be used to avoid the apparent rigidity in terms of the arity of the functions above; by using compositions with various projection functions, it is possible to pass a subset of the arguments of one function to another function.  For example, if g and h are 2-ary primitive recursive functions then\n\nis also primitive recursive.  One formal definition using projection functions is\n\n Converting predicates to numeric functions \n\nIn some settings it is natural to consider primitive recursive functions that take as inputs tuples that mix numbers with truth values (that is t for true and f for false), or that produce truth values as outputs.Kleene [1952 pp.\u00a0226\u2013227] This can be accomplished by identifying the truth values with numbers in any fixed manner.  For example, it is common to identify the truth value t with the number 1 and the truth value f with the number 0.  Once this identification has been made, the characteristic function of a set A, which always returns 1 or 0, can be viewed as a predicate that tells whether a number is in the set A.  Such an identification of predicates with numeric functions will be assumed for the remainder of this article.\n\n Computer language definition \n\nAn example of a primitive recursive programming language is one that contains basic arithmetic operators (e.g. + and \u2212, or ADD and SUBTRACT), conditionals and comparison (IF-THEN, EQUALS, LESS-THAN), and bounded loops, such as the basic for loop, where there is a known or calculable upper bound to all loops (FOR i FROM 1 to n, with neither i nor n modifiable by the loop body). No control structures of greater generality, such as while loops or IF-THEN plus GOTO, are admitted in a primitive recursive language. Douglas Hofstadter's BlooP in G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach is one such.  Adding unbounded loops (WHILE, GOTO) makes the language partially recursive, or Turing-complete; Floop is such, as are almost all real-world computer languages.\n\nArbitrary computer programs, or Turing machines, cannot in general be analyzed to see if they halt or not (the halting problem).  However, all primitive recursive functions halt. This is not a contradiction; primitive recursive programs are a non-arbitrary subset of all possible programs, constructed specifically to be analyzable.\n\n Examples \n\nMost number-theoretic functions definable using recursion on a single variable are primitive recursive.  Basic examples include the addition and truncated subtraction functions.\n\n Addition \nIntuitively, addition can be recursively defined with the rules:\n\n,\n\nTo fit this into a strict primitive recursive definition, define:\n\nHere S(n) is \"the successor of n\" (i.e., n+1), P11 is the identity function, and P23 is the projection function that takes 3 arguments and returns the second one. Functions f and g required by the above definition of the primitive recursion operation are respectively played by P11 and the composition of S and P23.\n\n Subtraction \n\nBecause primitive recursive functions use natural numbers rather than integers, and the natural numbers are not closed under subtraction, a truncated subtraction function (also called \"proper subtraction\") is studied in this context. This limited subtraction function sub(a, b) [or b \u2238 a] returns b - a if this is nonnegative and returns 0 otherwise.\n\nThe predecessor function acts as the opposite of the successor function and is recursively defined by the rules:\n\npred(0) = 0,\npred(n + 1) = n.\n\nThese rules can be converted into a more formal definition by primitive recursion:\n\npred(0) = 0,\npred(S(n)) = P12(n, pred(n)).\n\nThe limited subtraction function is definable from the predecessor function in a manner analogous to the way addition is defined from successor:\n\nsub(0, x) = P11(x), \nsub(S(n), x) = pred(P23(n, sub(n, x), x)).\n\nHere sub(a,  b) corresponds to b \u2238 a; for the sake of simplicity, the order of the arguments has been switched from the \"standard\" definition to fit the requirements of primitive recursion. This could easily be rectified using composition with suitable projections.\n\n Other operations on natural numbers \n\nExponentiation and primality testing are primitive recursive. Given primitive recursive functions e, f, g, and h, a function that returns the value of g when e\u2264f and the value of h otherwise is primitive recursive.\n\n Operations on integers and rational numbers \n\nBy using G\u00f6del numberings, the primitive recursive functions can be extended to operate on other objects such as integers and rational numbers.  If integers are encoded by G\u00f6del numbers in a standard way, the arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication are all primitive recursive.  Similarly, if the rationals are represented by G\u00f6del numbers then the field operations are all primitive recursive.\n\n Use in first-order Peano arithmetic \nIn first-order Peano arithmetic, there are infinitely many variables (0-ary symbols) but no k-ary non-logical symbols with k>0 other than S, +, *, and \u2264. Thus in order to define primitive recursive functions one has to use the following trick by G\u00f6del.\n\nBy using a G\u00f6del numbering for sequences, for example G\u00f6del's \u03b2 function, any sequence of numbers can be encoded by a single number. Such a number can therefore represent the primitive recursive function until a given n.\n\nLet h be a 1-ary primitive recursion function defined by:\n\nwhere C is a constant and g is an already defined function.\n\nUsing G\u00f6del's \u03b2 function, for any sequence of natural numbers (k0, k1, \u2026, kn), there are natural numbers b and c such that, for every i \u2264 n, \u03b2(b, c, i) = ki. We may thus use the following formula to define h; more precisely, m=h(n) is a shorthand for the following:\n\nand the equating to g, being already defined, is in fact shorthand for some other already defined formula (as is \u03b2, whose formula is given here).\n\nThe generalization to any k-ary primitive recursion function is trivial.\n\n Relationship to recursive functions \n\nThe broader class of partial recursive functions is defined by introducing an unbounded search operator.  The use of this operator may result in a partial function, that is, a relation with at most one value for each argument, but does not necessarily have any value for any argument (see domain).  An equivalent definition states that a partial recursive function is one that can be computed by a Turing machine.  A total recursive function is a partial recursive function that is defined for every input.\n\nEvery primitive recursive function is total recursive, but not all total recursive functions are primitive recursive. The Ackermann function A(m,n) is a well-known example of a total recursive function (in fact, provable total), that is not primitive recursive. There is a characterization of the primitive recursive functions as a subset of the total recursive functions using the Ackermann function.  This characterization states that a function is primitive recursive if and only if there is a natural number m such that the function can be computed by a Turing machine that always halts within A(m,n) or fewer steps, where n is the sum of the arguments of the primitive recursive function.This follows from the facts that the functions of this form are the most quickly growing primitive recursive functions, and that a function is primitive recursive if and only if its time complexity is bounded by a primitive recursive function. For the former, see . For the latter, see \n\nAn important property of the primitive recursive functions is that they are a recursively enumerable subset of the set of all total recursive functions (which is not itself recursively enumerable). This means that there is a single computable function f(m,n) that enumerates the primitive recursive functions, namely:\n For every primitive recursive function g, there is an m such that g(n) = f(m,n) for all n, and\n For every m, the function h(n) = f(m,n) is primitive recursive.\nf can be explicitly constructed by iteratively repeating all possible ways of creating primitive recursive functions. Thus, it is provably total. One can use a diagonalization argument to show that f is not recursive primitive in itself: had it been such, so would be h(n) = f(n,n)+1. But if this equals some primitive recursive function, there is an m such that h(n) = f(m,n) for all n, and then h(m) = f(m,m), leading to contradiction.\n\nHowever, the set of primitive recursive functions is not the largest recursively enumerable subset of the set of all total recursive functions. For example, the set of provably total functions (in Peano arithmetic) is also recursively enumerable, as one can enumerate all the proofs of the theory. While all primitive recursive functions are provably total, the converse is not true.\n\n Limitations \n\nPrimitive recursive functions tend to correspond very closely with our intuition of what a computable function must be. Certainly the initial functions are intuitively computable (in their very simplicity), and the two operations by which one can create new primitive recursive functions are also very straightforward. However, the set of primitive recursive functions does not include every possible total computable function\u2014this can be seen with a variant of Cantor's diagonal argument. This argument provides a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. A sketch of the proof is as follows:\n\nThe primitive recursive functions of one argument (i.e., unary functions) can be computably enumerated. This enumeration uses the definitions of the primitive recursive functions (which are essentially just expressions with the composition and primitive recursion operations as operators and the basic primitive recursive functions as atoms), and can be assumed to contain every definition once, even though a same function will occur many times on the list (since many definitions define the same function; indeed simply composing by the identity function generates infinitely many definitions of any one primitive recursive function). This means that the -th definition of a primitive recursive function in this enumeration can be effectively determined from . Indeed if one uses some G\u00f6del numbering to encode definitions as numbers, then this -th definition in the list is computed by a primitive recursive function of . Let  denote the unary primitive recursive function given by this definition.\n\nNow define the \"evaluator function\"  with two arguments, by . Clearly  is total and computable, since one can effectively determine the definition of , and being a primitive recursive function  is itself total and computable, so  is always defined and effectively computable. However a diagonal argument will show that the function  of two arguments is not primitive recursive.\n\nSuppose  were primitive recursive, then the unary function  defined by  would also be primitive recursive, as it is defined by composition from the successor function and . But then  occurs in the enumeration, so there is some number  such that . But now  gives a contradiction.\n\nThis argument can be applied to any class of computable (total) functions that can be enumerated in this way, as explained in the article Machines that always halt. Note however that the partial computable functions (those that need not be defined for all arguments) can be explicitly enumerated, for instance by enumerating Turing machine encodings.\n\nOther examples of total recursive but not primitive recursive functions are known:\nThe function that takes m to Ackermann(m,m) is a unary total recursive function that is not primitive recursive.\nThe Paris\u2013Harrington theorem involves a total recursive function that is not primitive recursive.  Because this function is motivated by Ramsey theory, it is sometimes considered more \"natural\" than the Ackermann function.\nThe Sudan function\nThe Goodstein function\n\n Some common primitive recursive functions \n\nThe following examples and definitions are from Kleene (1952) pp.\u00a0223\u2013231 \u2014 many appear with proofs. Most also appear with similar names, either as proofs or as examples, in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002 pp.\u00a063\u201370; they add #22 the logarithm lo(x, y) or lg(x, y) depending on the exact derivation.\n\nIn the following we observe that primitive recursive functions can be of four types:\n functions for short: \"number-theoretic functions\" from { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { 0, 1, 2, ...},\n predicates: from { 0, 1, 2, ...} to truth values { t =true, f =false },\n propositional connectives: from truth values { t, f } to truth values { t, f },\n representing functions: from truth values { t, f } to { 0, 1, 2, ... }. Many times a predicate requires a representing function to convert the predicate's output { t, f } to { 0, 1 } (note the order \"t\" to \"0\" and \"f\" to \"1\" matches with ~sg( ) defined below). By definition a function \u03c6(x) is a \"representing function\" of the predicate P(x) if \u03c6 takes only values 0 and 1 and produces 0 when P is true\".\n\nIn the following the mark \" ' \", e.g. a', is the primitive mark meaning \"the successor of\", usually thought of as \" +1\", e.g. a +1 =def a'. The functions 16-20 and #G are of particular interest with respect to converting primitive recursive predicates to, and extracting them from, their \"arithmetical\" form expressed as G\u00f6del numbers.\n\n Addition: a+b\n Multiplication: a\u00d7b\n Exponentiation: ab\n Factorial a! : 0! = 1, a'! = a!\u00d7a'\n pred(a): (Predecessor or decrement): If a > 0 then a-1 else 0\n Proper subtraction a \u2238 b: If a \u2265 b then a-b else 0\n Minimum(a1, ... an)\n Maximum(a1, ... an)\n Absolute difference: | a-b | =def (a \u2238 b) + (b \u2238 a)\n ~sg(a): NOT[signum(a)]: If a=0 then 1 else 0\n sg(a): signum(a): If a=0 then 0 else 1\n a | b: (a divides b): If b=k\u00d7a for some k then 0 else 1\n Remainder(a, b): the leftover if b does not divide a \"evenly\".

'So, in a sense the knowledge of the value NOT-\u03c6(y; x2 to n ) of the course-of-values function is equivalent to the knowledge of the sequence of values \u03c6(0,x2 to n), ..., \u03c6(y-1,x2 to n) of the original function.\"\n\n Additional primitive recursive forms \n\nSome additional forms of recursion also define functions that are in fact\nprimitive recursive.  Definitions in these forms may be easier to find or\nmore natural for reading or writing. Course-of-values recursion defines primitive recursive functions. Some forms of mutual recursion also define primitive recursive functions.\n\nThe functions that can be programmed in the LOOP programming language are exactly the primitive recursive functions. This gives a different characterization of the power of these functions. The main limitation of the LOOP language, compared to a Turing-complete language, is that in the LOOP language the number of times that each loop will run is specified before the loop begins to run.\n\n Finitism and consistency results \n\nThe primitive recursive functions are closely related to mathematical finitism, and are used in several contexts in mathematical logic where a particularly constructive system is desired. Primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA), a formal axiom system for the natural numbers and the primitive recursive functions on them, is often used for this purpose.\n\nPRA is much weaker than Peano arithmetic, which is not a finitistic system. Nevertheless, many results in number theory and in proof theory can be proved in PRA. For example, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem can be formalized into PRA, giving the following theorem:\nIf T is a theory of arithmetic satisfying certain hypotheses, with G\u00f6del sentence GT, then PRA proves the implication Con(T)\u2192GT.\nSimilarly, many of the syntactic results in proof theory can be proved in PRA, which implies that there are primitive recursive functions that carry out the corresponding syntactic transformations of proofs.\n\nIn proof theory and set theory, there is an interest in finitistic consistency proofs, that is, consistency proofs that themselves are finitistically acceptable. Such a proof establishes that the consistency of a theory T implies the consistency of a theory S by producing a primitive recursive function that can transform any proof of an inconsistency from S into a proof of an inconsistency from T.  One sufficient condition for a consistency proof to be finitistic is the ability to formalize it in PRA. For example, many consistency results in set theory that are obtained by forcing can be recast as syntactic proofs that can be formalized in PRA.\n\n History \nRecursive definitions had been used more or less formally in mathematics before, but the construction of primitive recursion is traced back to Richard Dedekind's theorem 126 of his Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen? (1888). This work was the first to give a proof that a certain recursive construction defines a unique function.\n\nPrimitive recursive arithmetic  was first proposed by Thoralf SkolemThoralf Skolem (1923) \"The foundations of elementary arithmetic\" in Jean van Heijenoort, translator and ed. (1967) From Frege to G\u00f6del: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931. Harvard Univ. Press: 302-33. in 1923.\n\nThe current terminology was coined by R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter (1934) after Ackermann had proved in 1928 that the function which today is named after him was not primitive recursive, an event which prompted the need to rename what until then were simply called recursive functions.\n\nSee also\n Grzegorczyk hierarchy\n Recursion (computer science)\n Primitive recursive functional\n Double recursion\n Primitive recursive set function\n Primitive recursive ordinal function\n\nNotes\n\n References \n Brainerd, W.S., Landweber, L.H.

{"title": "Quantifier (logic)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifier_%28logic%29", "text": "In logic, quantification specifies the quantity of specimens in the domain of discourse that satisfy an open formula. The two most common quantifiers mean \"for all\" and \"there exists\". For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever, by writing that for all n (where n is a natural number), there is another number (say, the successor of n) which is one bigger than n.\n\nA language element which generates a quantification (such as \"every\") is called a quantifier. \nThe resulting expression is a quantified expression, it is said to be quantified over the predicate (such as \"the natural number x has a successor\")  whose free variable is bound by the quantifier. \nIn formal languages, quantification is a formula constructor that produces new formulas from old ones.  \nThe semantics of the language specifies how the constructor is interpreted.\nTwo fundamental kinds of quantification in predicate logic are universal quantification and existential quantification. \nThe traditional symbol for the universal quantifier \"all\" is \"\u2200\", a rotated letter \"A\", and for the existential quantifier \"exists\" is  \"\u2203\", a rotated letter \"E\". These quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and Lindstr\u00f6m.\n\nQuantification is used as well in natural languages; examples of quantifiers in English are for all, for some, many, few, a lot, and no; see Quantifier (linguistics) for details.\n\nMathematics\nConsider the following statement:\n 1 \u00b7 2 = 1 + 1, and 2 \u00b7 2 = 2 + 2, and 3 \u00b7 2 = 3 + 3, ..., and 100 \u00b7 2 = 100 + 100, and ..., etc.\nThis has the appearance of an infinite conjunction of propositions.  From the point of view of formal languages this is immediately a problem, since syntax rules are expected to generate finite objects. The example above is fortunate in that there is a procedure to generate all the conjuncts.  However, if an assertion were to be made about every irrational number, there would be no way to enumerate all the conjuncts, since irrationals cannot be enumerated. A succinct formulation which avoids these problems uses universal quantification:\n For each natural number n, n \u00b7 2 = n + n.\nA similar analysis applies to the disjunction,\n 1 is equal to 5 + 5, or 2 is equal to 5 + 5, or 3 is equal to 5 + 5, ... , or 100 is equal to 5 + 5, or ..., etc.\nwhich can be rephrased using existential quantification:\n For some natural number n, n is equal to 5+5.\n\nAlgebraic approaches to quantification\nIt is possible to devise abstract algebras whose models include formal languages with quantification, but progress has been slow and interest in such algebra has been limited. Three approaches have been devised to date:\n Relation algebra, invented by Augustus De Morgan, and developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, Ernst Schr\u00f6der, Alfred Tarski, and Tarski's students. Relation algebra cannot represent any formula with quantifiers nested more than three deep. Surprisingly, the models of relation algebra include the axiomatic set theory ZFC and Peano arithmetic;\n Cylindric algebra, devised by Alfred Tarski, Leon Henkin, and others;\n The polyadic algebra of Paul Halmos.\n\nNotation\nThe two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is \"\u2200\", a rotated letter \"A\", which stands for  \"for all\" or \"all\".  The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is \"\u2203\", a rotated letter \"E\", which stands for \"there exists\" or \"exists\".\n\nAn example of translating a quantified English statement would be as follows. Given the statement, \"Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach,\" we can identify key aspects and rewrite using symbols including quantifiers. So, let X be the set of all Peter's friends, P(x) the predicate \"x likes to dance\", and Q(x) the predicate \"x likes to go to the beach\". Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as , which is read, \"for every x that is a member of X, P applies to x or Q applies to x.\"\n\nSome other quantified expressions are constructed as follows, \n \nfor a formula P. These two expressions (using the definitions above) are read as \"there exists a friend of Peter who likes to dance\" and \"all friends of Peter like to dance\" respectively.\nVariant notations include, for set X and set members x:\n \nAll of these variations also apply to universal quantification.\nOther variations for the universal quantifier are\n \n\nSome versions of the notation explicitly mention the range of quantification.  The range of quantification must always be specified; for a given mathematical theory, this can be done in several ways:\n Assume a fixed domain of discourse for every quantification, as is done in Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory,\n Fix several domains of discourse in advance and require that each variable have a declared domain, which is the type of that variable. This is analogous to the situation in statically typed computer programming languages, where variables have declared types.\n Mention explicitly the range of quantification, perhaps using a symbol for the set of all objects in that domain or the type of the objects in that domain.\n\nOne can use any variable as a quantified variable in place of any other, under certain restrictions in which variable capture does not occur.  Even if the notation uses typed variables, variables of that type may be used.\n\nInformally or in natural language, the \"\u2200x\" or \"\u2203x\" might appear after or in the middle of P(x). Formally, however, the phrase that introduces the dummy variable is placed in front.\n\nMathematical formulas mix symbolic expressions for quantifiers with natural language quantifiers such as,\n For every natural number x, ...\n There exists an x such that ...\n For at least one x, ....\n\nKeywords for uniqueness quantification include:\n For exactly one natural number x, ...\n There is one and only one x such that ....\nFurther, x may be replaced by a pronoun. For example, \nFor every natural number, its product with 2 equals to its sum with itself.\nSome natural number is prime.\n\nNesting\nThe order of quantifiers is critical to meaning, as is illustrated by the following two propositions:\nFor every natural number n, there exists a natural number s such that s = n2.\nThis is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. The meaning of the assertion in which the quantifiers are turned around is different:\nThere exists a natural number s such that for every natural number n, s = n2.\nThis is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number s that is at the same time the square of every natural number. This is because the syntax directs that any variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables.\n\nA less trivial example from mathematical analysis are the concepts of uniform and pointwise continuity, whose definitions differ only by an exchange in the positions of two quantifiers.\nA function f from R to R is called\n pointwise continuous if \n uniformly continuous if \nIn the former case, the particular value chosen for \u03b4 can be a function of both \u03b5 and x, the variables that precede it.\nIn the latter case, \u03b4 can be a function only of \u03b5, i.e. it has to be chosen independent of x.\nFor example, f(x) = x2 satisfies pointwise, but not uniform continuity.\nIn contrast, interchanging the two initial universal quantifiers in the definition of pointwise continuity does not change the meaning.\n\nThe maximum depth of nesting of quantifiers inside a formula is called its quantifier rank.\n\nEquivalent expressions\nIf D is a domain of x and P(x) is a predicate dependent on x, then the universal proposition can be expressed as\n\nThis notation is known as restricted or relativized or bounded quantification. Equivalently we can write,\n\nThe existential proposition can be expressed with bounded quantification as\n\nor equivalently\n\nTogether with negation, only one of either the universal or existential quantifier is needed to perform both tasks:\n\nwhich shows that to disprove a \"for all x\" proposition, one needs no more than to find an x for which the predicate is false. Similarly,\n\nto disprove a \"there exists an x\" proposition, one needs to show that the predicate is false for all x.\n\nRange of quantification\nEvery quantification involves one specific variable and a domain of discourse or range of quantification of that variable.  The range of quantification specifies the set of values that the variable takes.  In the examples above, the range of quantification is the set of natural numbers.  Specification of the range of quantification allows us to express the difference between, asserting that a predicate holds for some natural number or for some real number. Expository conventions often reserve some variable names such as \"n\" for natural numbers and \"x\" for real numbers, although relying exclusively on naming conventions cannot work in general since ranges of variables can change in the course of a mathematical argument.\n\nA more natural way to restrict the domain of discourse uses guarded quantification.  For example, the guarded quantification \nFor some natural number n, n is even and n is prime\nmeans\nFor some even number n, n is prime.\n\nIn some mathematical theories a single domain of\ndiscourse fixed in advance is assumed.  For example, in Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, variables range over all sets.  In this case, guarded quantifiers can be used to mimic a smaller range of quantification.  Thus in the example\nabove to express\nFor every natural number n, n\u00b72 = n + n\nin Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, it can be said\nFor every n, if n belongs to N, then n\u00b72 = n + n,\nwhere N is the set of all natural numbers.\n\nFormal semantics\nMathematical Semantics is the application of mathematics to study the meaning of expressions in a formal language. It has three elements: A mathematical specification of a class of objects via syntax, a mathematical specification of various semantic domains and the relation between the two, which is usually expressed as a function from syntactic objects to semantic ones.  This article only addresses the issue of how quantifier elements are interpreted.\nThe syntax of a formula can be given by a syntax tree. A quantifier has a scope, and an occurrence of a variable x is free if it is not within the scope of a quantification for that variable. Thus in\n\nthe occurrence of both x and y in C(y,x) is free, while the occurrence of x and y in B(y,x) is bound (i.e. non-free).\n\nthumb|350px|Syntax tree of the formula , illustrating scope and variable capture. Bound and free variable occurrences are colored in red and green, respectively.\nAn interpretation for first-order predicate calculus assumes as given\na domain of individuals X.  A formula A whose free variables\nare x1, ..., xn is interpreted as a\nboolean-valued function F(v1, ...,\nvn) of n arguments, where each argument ranges\nover the domain X.  Boolean-valued means that the function assumes one of the values T (interpreted as truth) or F (interpreted as falsehood). The interpretation of the formula\n\nis the function G of n-1 arguments such that G(v1, ...,vn-1) = T if and only if F(v1, ..., vn-1, w) = T for every w in X. If  F(v1, ..., vn-1, w) = F for at least one value of w, then G(v1, ...,vn-1) = F.  Similarly the interpretation of the formula\n\nis the function H of n-1 arguments such that H(v1, ...,vn-1) = T if and only if F(v1, ...,vn-1, w) = T for at least one w and  H(v1, ..., vn-1) = F otherwise.\n\nThe semantics for uniqueness quantification requires  first-order predicate calculus with equality. This means there is given a distinguished two-placed predicate \"=\"; the semantics is also modified accordingly so that \"=\" is always interpreted as the two-place equality relation on X. The interpretation of  \n\nthen is the function of n-1 arguments, which is the logical and of the interpretations of \n\nPaucal, multal and other degree quantifiers\n\nNone of the quantifiers previously discussed apply to a quantification such as\n\nThere are many integers n < 100, such that n is divisible by 2 or 3 or 5.\n\nOne possible interpretation mechanism can be obtained as follows: Suppose that in addition to a semantic domain X, we have given a probability measure P defined on X and cutoff numbers 0 < a \u2264 b \u2264  1.  If A is a formula with free variables x1,...,xn whose interpretation is\nthe function F of variables v1,...,vn\nthen the interpretation of \n\nis the function of v1,...,vn-1 which is T if and only if\n\nand F otherwise.  Similarly, the interpretation of \n\nis the function of v1,...,vn-1 which is F if and only if\n\nand T otherwise.\n\nOther quantifiers\nA few other quantifiers have been proposed over time. In particular, the solution quantifier,Hehner, Eric C. R., 2004, Practical Theory of Programming, 2nd edition, p. 28 noted \u00a7 (section sign) and read \"those\". For example:\n\nis read \"those n in N such that n2 \u2264 4 are in {0,1,2}.\" The same construct is expressible in set-builder notation:\n\nSome other quantifiers sometimes used in mathematics include:\nThere are infinitely many elements such that...\nFor all but finitely many elements... (sometimes expressed as \"for almost all elements...\").\nThere are uncountably many elements such that...\nFor all but countably many elements...\nFor all elements in a set of positive measure...\nFor all elements except those in a set of measure zero...\n\nHistory\nTerm logic, also called Aristotelian logic, treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language, and also less suited to formal analysis. Term logic treated All, Some  and No in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the alethic modalities.\n\nIn 1827, George Bentham published his Outline of a new system of logic, with a critical examination of Dr Whately's Elements of Logic, describing the principle of the quantifier, but the book was not widely circulated.George Bentham, Outline of a new system of logic: with a critical examination of Dr. Whately's Elements of Logic (1827); Thoemmes; Facsimile edition (1990)  \n\nthumb|upright|Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871) was the first to use \"quantifier\" in the modern way.\nWilliam Hamilton claimed to have coined the terms \"quantify\" and \"quantification\", most likely in his Edinburgh lectures c. 1840. Augustus De Morgan confirmed this in 1847, but modern usage began with De Morgan in 1862 where he makes statements such as \"We are to take in both all and some-not-all as quantifiers\".\n\nGottlob Frege, in his 1879 Begriffsschrift, was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a domain of discourse and appearing in predicates. He would universally quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification, instead employing his equivalent of ~\u2200x~, or contraposition. Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until Bertrand Russell's 1903 Principles of Mathematics.\n\nIn work that culminated in Peirce (1885), Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and bound variables. Peirce and Mitchell wrote \u03a0x and \u03a3x where we now write \u2200x and \u2203x. Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of Ernst Schr\u00f6der, Leopold Loewenheim, Thoralf Skolem, and Polish logicians into the 1950s. Most notably, it is the notation of Kurt G\u00f6del's landmark 1930 paper on the completeness of first-order logic, and 1931 paper on the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic.\n\nPeirce's approach to quantification also influenced William Ernest Johnson and Giuseppe Peano, who invented yet another notation, namely (x) for the universal quantification of x and (in 1897) \u2203x for the existential quantification of x. Hence for decades, the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was (x)P to express \"all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property P,\" and \"(\u2203x)P\" for \"there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property P.\" Peano, who was much better known than Peirce, in effect diffused the latter's thinking throughout Europe. Peano's notation was adopted by the Principia Mathematica of Whitehead and Russell, Quine, and Alonzo Church. In 1935, Gentzen introduced the \u2200 symbol, by analogy with Peano's \u2203 symbol. \u2200 did not become canonical until the 1960s.\n\nAround 1895, Peirce began developing his existential graphs, whose variables can be seen as tacitly quantified. Whether the shallowest instance of a variable is even or odd determines whether that variable's quantification is universal or existential. (Shallowness is the contrary of depth, which is determined by the nesting of negations.) Peirce's graphical logic has attracted some attention in recent years by those researching heterogeneous reasoning and diagrammatic inference.\n\nSee also\n\nGeneralized quantifier \u2014 a higher-order property used as standard semantics of quantified noun phrases\nLindstr\u00f6m quantifier \u2014 a generalized polyadic quantifier\nQuantifier elimination\n\nReferences\n\n Barwise, Jon; and Etchemendy, John, 2000.

{"title": "Robinson arithmetic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_arithmetic", "text": "In mathematics, Robinson arithmetic, or Q, is a finitely axiomatized fragment of first-order Peano arithmetic (PA), first set out in R. M. Robinson (1950). Q is almost PA without the axiom schema of induction. Q is weaker than PA but it has the same language, and both theories are incomplete. Q is important and interesting because it is a finitely axiomatized fragment of PA that is recursively incompletable and essentially undecidable.\n\nAxioms\nThe background logic of Q is first-order logic with identity, denoted by infix '='. The individuals, called natural numbers, are members of a set called N with a distinguished member 0, called zero. There are three operations over N:\n\nA unary operation called successor and denoted by prefix\u00a0S;\nTwo binary operations, addition and multiplication, denoted by infix + and by concatenation, respectively.\n\nThe following axioms for Q are Q1\u2013Q7 in Burgess (2005: 56), and are also the first seven axioms of first-order arithmetic. Variables not bound by an existential quantifier are bound by an implicit universal quantifier.\n\n Sx \u2260 0\n0 is not the successor of any number.\n (Sx = Sy) \u2192 x = y \n If the successor of x is identical to the successor of y, then x and y are identical. (1) and (2) yield the minimum of facts about N (it is an infinite set bounded by 0) and S (it is an injective function whose domain is N) needed for non-triviality. The converse of (2) follows from the properties of identity.\n y=0 \u2228 \u2203x (Sx = y)\n Every number is either 0 or the successor of some number. The axiom schema of mathematical induction present in arithmetics stronger than Q turns this axiom into a theorem.\n x + 0 = x\n x + Sy = S(x + y)\n (4) and (5) are the recursive definition of addition.\n x\u00b70 = 0\n x\u00b7Sy = (x\u00b7y) + x\n (6) and (7) are the recursive definition of multiplication.\n\nVariant axiomatizations\nThe axioms in Robinson (1950) are (1)\u2013(13) in Mendelson (1997: 201). The first 6 of Robinson's 13 axioms are required only when, unlike here, the background logic does not include identity. Machover (1996: 256\u201357) dispenses with axiom (3).\n\nThe usual strict total order on N, \"less than\" (denoted by \"<\"), can be defined in terms of addition via the rule  (Burgess 2005:230, fn. 24).\n\nTaking \"<\" as primitive requires adding four axioms to (1)\u2013(7) above:\n \u00ac(x < 0)\n 0 = x \u2228 0 < x\nx < y \u2194 (Sx < y \u2228 Sx = y)\nx < Sy \u2194 (x < y \u2228 x = y).\n\nAnother axiomatization using < may be found in Shoenfield (1967: 22).\n\nMetamathematics\nOn the metamathematics of Q, see Boolos et al. (2002: chpt. 14), Tarski, Mostowski, and Robinson (1953), Smullyan (1991), Mendelson (1997: 201\u201303), and Burgess (2005: \u00a7\u00a71.5a, 2.2). The intended interpretation of Q is the natural numbers and their usual arithmetic in which addition and multiplication have their customary meaning, identity is equality,  and 0 is the natural number zero. \n\nQ, like Peano arithmetic, has nonstandard models of all infinite cardinalities. However, unlike Peano arithmetic, Tennenbaum's theorem does not apply to Q, and it has computable non-standard models. For instance, there is a computable model of Q consisting of integer-coefficient polynomials with positive leading coefficient, plus the zero polynomial, with their usual arithmetic.\n\nA notable characteristic of Q is the absence of the axiom scheme of induction. Hence it is often possible to prove in Q every specific instance of a fact about the natural numbers, but not the associated general theorem. For example, 5 + 7 = 7 + 5 is provable in Q, but the general statement x + y = y + x is not.  Similarly, one cannot prove that Sx \u2260 x (Burgess 2005:56).\n\nQ is interpretable in a fragment of Zermelo's axiomatic set theory, consisting of extensionality, existence of the empty set, and the axiom of adjunction. This theory is S' in Tarski et al. (1953: 34) and ST in Burgess (2005: 90\u201391; 223). See general set theory for more details.\n\nQ is fascinating because it is a finitely axiomatized first-order theory that is considerably weaker than Peano arithmetic (PA), and whose axioms contain only one existential quantifier, yet like PA is incomplete and incompletable in the sense of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, and essentially undecidable. Robinson (1950) derived the Q axioms (1)\u2013(7) above by noting just what PA axioms are required to prove (Mendelson 1997: Th. 3.24) that every computable function is representable in PA. The only use this proof makes of the PA axiom schema of induction is to prove a statement that is axiom (3) above, and so, all computable functions are representable in Q (Mendelson 1997: Th. 3.33, Rautenberg 2010: 246). The conclusion of G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem also holds for Q: no consistent recursively axiomatized extension of Q can prove its own consistency, even if we additionally restrict G\u00f6del numbers of proofs to a definable cut (Bezboruah and Shepherdson 1976; Pudl\u00e1k 1985; H\u00e1jek & Pudl\u00e1k 1993:387).\n\nThe first incompleteness theorem applies only to axiomatic systems defining sufficient arithmetic to carry out the necessary coding constructions (of which G\u00f6del numbering forms a part). The axioms of Q were chosen specifically to ensure they are strong enough for this purpose. Thus the usual proof of the first incompleteness theorem can be used to show that Q is incomplete and undecidable. This indicates that the incompleteness and undecidability of PA cannot be blamed on the only aspect of PA differentiating it from Q, namely the axiom schema of induction. \n\nG\u00f6del's theorems do not hold when any one of the seven axioms above is dropped. These fragments of Q remain undecidable, but they are no longer essentially undecidable: they have consistent decidable extensions, as well as uninteresting models (i.e., models which are not end-extensions of the standard natural numbers).\n\nSee also\n General set theory\n Gentzen's consistency proof\n G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem\n List of first-order theories\n Peano axioms\n Second-order arithmetic\n Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers\n\nReferences\nA.

Latin also exerted a strong influence in southeastern Britain, the Roman province of Africa, western Germany, Pannonia and the whole Balkans.\n\nDuring the Empire's decline, and after its fragmentation and the collapse of Western half in the fifth and sixth centuries, the spoken varieties of Latin became more isolated from each other, with the western dialects coming under heavy Germanic influence (the Goths and Franks in particular) and the eastern dialects coming under Slavic influence. The dialects diverged from classical Latin at an accelerated rate and eventually evolved into a continuum of recognizably different typologies. The colonial empires established by Portugal, Spain, and France from the fifteenth century onward spread their languages to the other continents to such an extent that about two-thirds of all Romance language speakers today live outside Europe.\n\nDespite other influences (e.g. substratum from pre-Roman languages, especially Continental Celtic languages; and superstratum from later Germanic or Slavic invasions), the phonology, morphology, and lexicon of all Romance languages consist mainly of evolved forms of Vulgar Latin. However, some notable differences occur between today's Romance languages and their Roman ancestor. With only one or two exceptions, Romance languages have lost the declension system of Latin and, as a result, have SVO sentence structure and make extensive use of prepositions.\n\nName\n\nThe term Romance comes from the Vulgar Latin adverb , \"in Roman\", derived from : for instance, in the expression , \"to speak in Roman\" (that is, the Latin vernacular), contrasted with , \"to speak in Latin\" (Medieval Latin, the conservative version of the language used in writing and formal contexts or as a lingua franca), and with , \"to speak in Barbarian\" (the non-Latin languages of the peoples living outside the Roman Empire). From this adverb the noun romance originated, which applied initially to anything written , or \"in the Roman vernacular\".\n\nThe word 'romance' with the modern sense of romance novel or love affair has the same origin. In the medieval literature of Western Europe, serious writing was usually in Latin, while popular tales, often focusing on heroic adventures and courtly love, were composed in the vernacular and came to be called \"romances\".\n\nSamples\nLexical and grammatical similarities among the Romance languages, and between Latin and each of them, are apparent from the following examples having the same meaning in various Romance lects:\n\nEnglish: She always closes the window before she dines / before dining.\n\n{| cellspacing=\"3px\"\n|-\n| Latin ||| \n|-\n| Vulgar Latin ||| / claudi[t] semper illa fenestra antequam (later, only in Italy \n|-\n| Apulian ||| \n|-\n| Aragonese ||| \n|-\n| Aromanian ||| \n|-\n| Asturian ||| \n|-\n| Emilian-Romagnol Bolognese ||| \n|-\n| Catalan ||| \n|-\n| Northern Corsican ||| .\n|-\n| Southern Corsican ||| .\n|-\n| Emilian ||| \n|-\n| Extremaduran ||| \n|-\n| Franco-Proven\u00e7al ||| \n|-\n| French ||| \n|-\n| Friulian ||| \n|-\n| Galician ||| \n|-\n| Gallurese ||| \n|-\n| Italian ||| \n|-\n| Judaeo-Spanish ||| ; \n|-\n| Ladin |||  (badiot)  (Gherd\u00ebina)\nCentro Cadore: La sera sempre la fenestra gnante de disna.\nAuronzo di Cadore: La sera sempro la fenestra davoi de disn\u00e0.\n|-\n| Leonese ||| \n|-\n| Ligurian ||| \n|-\n| Lombard (east.)(Bergamasque) ||| \n|-\n| Lombard (west.) || \n|-\n| Magoua ||| \n|-\n| Mirandese ||| \n|-\n| Mozarabic |||   (reconstructed)\n|-\n| Neapolitan ||| \n|-\n| Norman ||| \n|-\n| Occitan ||| \n|-\n| Picard ||| \n|-\n| Piedmontese ||| \n|-\n| Portuguese ||| \n|-\n| Romagnol ||| \n|-\n| Romanian ||| \n|-\n| Romansh ||| \n|-\n| Southern Sardinian |||  \n|-\n| Northern Sardinian ||| \n|-\n| Sassarese ||| \n|-\n| Sicilian ||| \n|-\n| Spanish ||| \n|-\n| Tuscan ||| \n|-\n| Umbrian ||| \n|-\n| Venetian ||| \n|-\n| Walloon ||| \n|}\n\nRomance-based creoles and pidgins\n{| cellspacing=\"3px\"\n|-\n| Haitian Creole ||| \n|-\n| Mauritian Creole ||| \n|-\n| Seychellois Creole ||| \n|-\n| Papiamento ||| \n|-\n| Cape Verdean Creole ||| \n|-\n| Chavacano ||| \n|}\n\nSome of the divergence comes from semantic change: where the same root word has developed different meanings. For example, the Portuguese word  is descended from Latin  \"window\" (and is thus cognate to French , Italian , Romanian  and so on), but now means \"skylight\" and \"slit\". Cognates may exist but have become rare, such as  in Spanish, or dropped out of use entirely. The Spanish and Portuguese terms  meaning \"to throw through a window\" and  meaning \"replete with windows\" also have the same root, but are later borrowings from Latin.\n\nLikewise, Portuguese also has the word , a cognate of Italian  and Spanish , but uses it in the sense of \"to have a late supper\" in most varieties, while the preferred word for \"to dine\" is  (related to archaic Spanish  \"to eat\") because of semantic changes in the 19th century. Galician has both  (from medieval f\u1ebdestra, the ancestor of standard Portuguese ) and the less frequently used  and .\n\nAs an alternative to  (originally the genitive form), Italian has the pronoun , a cognate of the other words for \"she\", but it is hardly ever used in speaking.\n\nSpanish, Asturian, and Leonese  and Mirandese and Sardinian  come from Latin  \"wind\" (cf. English window, etymologically 'wind eye'), and Portuguese , Galician , Mirandese  from Latin * \"small opening\", a derivative of  \"door\".\n\nSardinian  (alternative for /) comes from Old Italian and is similar to other Romance languages such as French  (from Italian ), Portuguese , Romanian , Spanish , Catalan  and Corsican  (alternative for ).\n\nHistory\n\nVulgar Latin\n\nthumb|upright=1.59|right|Length of the Roman rule and the Romance Languages\nthumb|upright=1.59|right|Romance languages in Europe\nDocumentary evidence is limited about Vulgar Latin for the purposes of comprehensive research, and the literature is often hard to interpret or generalize. Many of its speakers were soldiers, slaves, displaced peoples, and forced resettlers, more likely to be natives of conquered lands than natives of Rome. In Western Europe, Latin gradually replaced Celtic and other Italic languages, which were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.Rochette, p. 550Stefan Zimmer, \"Indo-European,\" in Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 961\n\nVulgar Latin is believed to have already had most of the features shared by all Romance languages, which distinguish them from Classical Latin, such as the almost complete loss of the Latin grammatical case system and its replacement by prepositions; the loss of the neuter grammatical gender and comparative inflections; replacement of some verb paradigms by innovations (e.g. the synthetic future gave way to an originally analytic strategy now typically formed by infinitive + evolved present indicative forms of 'have'); the use of articles; and the initial stages of the palatalization of the plosives /k/, /g/, and /t/.\n\nTo some scholars, this suggests the form of Vulgar Latin that evolved into the Romance languages was around during the time of the Roman Empire (from the end of the first century BC), and was spoken alongside the written Classical Latin which was reserved for official and formal occasions. Other scholars argue that the distinctions are more rightly viewed as indicative of sociolinguistic and register differences normally found within any language. Both were mutually intelligible as one and the same language, which was true until very approximately the second half of the 7th century. However, within two hundred years Latin became a dead language since \"the Romanized people of Europe could no longer understand texts that were read aloud or recited to them,\", pp. 108\u2013115 i.e. Latin had ceased to be a first language and became a foreign language that had to be learned, if the label Latin is constrained to refer to a state of the language frozen in past time and restricted to linguistic features for the most part typical of higher registers.\n\nWith the rise of the Roman Empire, Vulgar Latin spread first throughout Italy and then through southern, western, central, and southeast Europe, and northern Africa along parts of western Asia.\n\nFall of the Western Roman Empire\nDuring the political decline of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century, there were large-scale migrations into the empire, and the Latin-speaking world was fragmented into several independent states. Central Europe and the Balkans were occupied by Germanic and Slavic tribes, as well as by Huns. These incursions isolated the Vlachs from the rest of Romance-speaking Europe.\n\nBritish and African Romance\u2014the forms of Vulgar Latin used in southeastern Britain and the Roman province of Africa, where it had been spoken by much of the urban population\u2014disappeared in the Middle Ages (as did Pannonian Romance in what is now Hungary, and Moselle Romance in Germany). But the Germanic tribes that had penetrated Roman Italy, Gaul, and Hispania eventually adopted Latin/Romance and the remnants of the culture of ancient Rome alongside existing inhabitants of those regions, and so Latin remained the dominant language there. In part due to regional dialects of the Latin language and local environments, several languages evolved from it.\n\nFall of the Eastern Roman empire\nMeanwhile, large-scale migrations into the Eastern Roman Empire started with the Goths and continued with Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Slavs, Pechenegs, Hungarians and Cumans. The invasions of Slavs were the most thoroughgoing, and they partially reduced the Romanic element in the Balkans.Vlad Georgescu, The Romanians: A History, Ohio State University Press, Columbus, p.12 \t\nThe invasion of the Turks and conquest of Constantinople in 1453 marked the end of the empire. The Slavs named the Romance-speaking population Vlachs, while the latter called themselves \"Rum\u00e2n\" or \"Rom\u00e2n\", from the Latin \"Romanus\"Ioan-Aurel Pop, \"On the Significance of Certain Names: Romanian/Wallachian and Romania/Wallachia\" (PDF). Retrieved 18 June 2018 The Daco-Roman dialect became fully distinct from the three dialects spoken South of the Danube\u2014Macedo-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, and Megleno-Romanian\u2014during the ninth and tenth centuries, when the Romanians (sometimes called Vlachs or Wallachians) emerged as a people.Vlad Georgescu, The Romanians: A History, Ohio State University Press, Columbus, p.13\n\nEarly Romance\nOver the course of the fourth to eighth centuries, local changes in phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon accumulated to the point that the speech of any locale was noticeably different from another. In principle, differences between any two lects increased the more they were separated geographically, reducing easy mutual intelligibility between speakers of distant communities. Clear evidence of some levels of change is found in the Reichenau Glosses, an eighth-century compilation of about 1,200 words from the fourth-century Vulgate of Jerome that had changed in phonological form or were no longer normally used, along with their eighth-century equivalents in proto-Franco-Proven\u00e7al. The following are some examples with reflexes in several modern Romance languages for comparison:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! English !! Classical / 4th cent. (Vulgate) !! 8th cent. (Reichenau) !!

It is likely that some of these words had already disappeared from casual speech by the time of the Glosses; but if so, they may well have been still widely understood, as there is no recorded evidence that the common people of the time had difficulty understanding the language.\n\nBy the 8th century, the situation was very different. During the late 8th century, Charlemagne, holding that \"Latin of his age was by classical standards intolerably corrupt\", successfully imposed Classical Latin as an artificial written vernacular for Western Europe.  Unfortunately, this meant that parishioners could no longer understand the sermons of their priests, forcing the Council of Tours in 813 to issue an edict that priests needed to translate their speeches into the rustica romana lingua, an explicit acknowledgement of the reality of the Romance languages as separate languages from Latin. \n\nBy this time, and possibly as early as the 6th century according to Price (1984), the Romance lects had split apart enough to be able to speak of separate Gallo-Romance, Ibero-Romance, Italo-Romance and Eastern Romance languages. Some researchers have postulated that the major divergences in the spoken dialects began or accelerated considerably in the 5th century, as the formerly widespread and efficient communication networks of the Western Roman Empire rapidly broke down, leading to the total disappearance of the Western Roman Empire by the end of the century. The critical period between the 5th\u201310th centuries AD is poorly documented because little or no writing from the chaotic \"Dark Ages\" of the 5th\u20138th centuries has survived, and writing after that time was in consciously classicized Medieval Latin, with vernacular writing only beginning in earnest in the 11th or 12th centuries. An exception such as the Oaths of Strasbourg is evidence that by the ninth century effective communication with a non-learn\u00e8d audience was carried out in evolved Romance.\n\nA language that was closely related to medieval Romanian was spoken during the Dark Ages by Vlachs in the Balkans, Herzegovina, Dalmatia (Morlachs), Ukraine (Hutsuls), Poland (Gorals), Slovakia, and Czech Moravia, but gradually these communities lost their maternal language.Ilona Czama\u0144ska, \"Vlachs and Slavs in the Middle Ages and Modern Era\", Res Historica, 41, Lublin, 2016\n\nRecognition of the vernaculars\nBetween the 10th and 13th centuries, some local vernaculars developed a written form and began to supplant Latin in many of its roles. In some countries, such as Portugal, this transition was expedited by force of law; whereas in others, such as Italy, many prominent poets and writers used the vernacular of their own accord\u00a0\u2013 some of the most famous in Italy being Giacomo da Lentini and Dante Alighieri. Well before that, the vernacular was also used for practical purposes, such as the testimonies in the Placiti Cassinesi, written 960-963.\n\nUniformization and standardization\nThe invention of the printing press brought a tendency towards greater uniformity of standard languages within political boundaries, at the expense of other Romance languages and dialects less favored politically. In France, for instance, the dialect spoken in the region of Paris gradually spread to the entire country, and the Occitan of the south lost ground.\n\nModern status\n\nthumb|upright=1.36|European extent of Romance languages in the 20th century\nthumb|upright=1.36|Number of native speakers of each Romance language, as fractions of the total 690 million (2007)\nThe Romance language most widely spoken natively today is Spanish (Castilian), followed by Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian, which together cover a vast territory in Europe and beyond, and work as official and national languages in dozens of countries.\n\nupright=1.59|thumb|Romance languages in the World\n\nFrench, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Romanian are also official languages of the European Union. Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian, and Catalan are the official languages of the Latin Union; and French and Spanish are two of the six official languages of the United Nations. Outside Europe, French, Portuguese and Spanish are spoken and enjoy official status in various countries that emerged from the respective colonial empires. Spanish is an official language in nine countries of South America, home to about half that continent's population; in six countries of Central America (all except Belize); and in Mexico. In the Caribbean, it is official in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. In all these countries, Latin American Spanish is the vernacular language of the majority of the population, giving Spanish the most native speakers of any Romance language. In Africa it is an official language of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nPortuguese, in its original homeland, Portugal, is spoken by virtually the entire population of 10 million.\nAs the official language of Brazil, it is spoken by more than 200 million people in that country, as well as by neighboring residents of eastern Paraguay and northern Uruguay, accounting for a little more than half the population of South America. It is the official language of six African countries (Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe), and is spoken as a first language by perhaps 30 million residents of that continent.See Portuguese in Africa. In Asia, Portuguese is co-official with other languages in East Timor and Macau, while most Portuguese-speakers in Asia\u2014some 400,000See Portuguese in Asia and Oceania.\u2014are in Japan due to return immigration of Japanese Brazilians. In North America 1,000,000 people speak Portuguese as their home language.See List of countries where Portuguese is an official language.\nIn Oceania, Portuguese is the second most spoken Romance language, after French, due mainly to the number of speakers in East Timor. Its closest relative, Galician, has official status in the autonomous community of Galicia in Spain, together with Spanish.\n\nOutside Europe, French is spoken natively most in the Canadian province of Quebec, and in parts of New Brunswick and Ontario. Canada is officially bilingual, with French and English being the official languages. In parts of the Caribbean, such as Haiti, French has official status, but most people speak creoles such as Haitian Creole as their native language. French also has official status in much of Africa, but relatively few native speakers. In France's overseas possessions, native use of French is increasing.\n\nAlthough Italy also had some colonial possessions before World War II, its language did not remain official after the end of the colonial domination. As a result, Italian outside of Italy and Switzerland is now spoken only as a minority language by immigrant communities in North and South America and Australia. In some former Italian colonies in Africa\u2014namely Libya, Eritrea and Somalia\u2014it is spoken by a few educated people in commerce and government.\n\nRomania did not establish a colonial empire, but beyond its native territory in southeastern Europe, the Romanian language is spoken as a minority language by autochthonous populations in Serbia, Bulgaria, and Hungary, and in some parts of the former Greater Romania (before 1945), as well as in Ukraine (Bukovina, Budjak) and in some villages between the Dniester and Bug rivers.I.S. Nistor, \"Istoria rom\u00e2nilor din Transnistria\" (The history of Romanians from Transnistria), Bucure\u0219ti, 1995 The Aromanian language is spoken today by Aromanians in Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo, and Greece.Djuvara Neagu, \u201cLa Diaspora aroumaine aux XVIIIe et XIXe si\u00e8cles \u201c In: Les Aroumains, Paris : Publications Langues\u2019O, 1989 (Cahiers du Centre d\u2019\u00e9tude des civilisations d\u2019Europe centrale et du Sud-Est ; 8). P. 95-125. Romanian also spread to other countries on the Mediterranean (especially the other Romance-speaking countries, most notably Italy and Spain), and elsewhere such as Israel, where it is the native language of five percent of the population,1993 Statistical Abstract of Israel reports 250,000 speakers of Romanian in Israel, while the 1995 census puts the total figure of the Israeli population at 5,548,523 and is spoken by many more as a secondary language. This is due to the large number of Romanian-born Jews who moved to Israel after World War II. And finally, some 2.6\u00a0million people in the former Soviet republic of Moldova speak a variety of Romanian, called variously Moldovan or Romanian by them.\n\nThe total native speakers of Romance languages are divided as follows (with their ranking within the languages of the world in brackets):\n Spanish (Hispanosphere) 49% (2nd)\n Portuguese (Lusosphere) 26% (6th)\n French (Francophonie) 8.6% (18th)\n Italian 7.7% (23rd)\n Romanian 3.0% (49th)\n Catalan 0.9% (not in the top 100)\n Others 3.6%\n\nCatalan is the official language of Andorra. In Spain, it is co-official with Spanish (Castilian) in Catalonia, the Valencian Community, and the Balearic Islands, and it is recognized, but not official, in La Franja, and in Aragon. In addition, it is spoken by many residents of Alghero, on the island of Sardinia, and it is co-official in that city. Galician, with more than a million native speakers, is official together with Spanish in Galicia, and has legal recognition in neighbouring territories in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. A few other languages have official recognition on a regional or otherwise limited level; for instance, Asturian and Aragonese in Spain; Mirandese in Portugal; Friulan, Sardinian and Franco-Proven\u00e7al in Italy; and Romansh in Switzerland.\n\nThe remaining Romance languages survive mostly as spoken languages for informal contact. National governments have historically viewed linguistic diversity as an economic, administrative or military liability, as well as a potential source of separatist movements; therefore, they have generally fought to eliminate it, by extensively promoting the use of the official language, restricting the use of the other languages in the media, recognizing them as mere \"dialects\", or even persecuting them. As a result, all of these languages are considered endangered to varying degrees according to the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages, ranging from \"vulnerable\" (e.g. Sicilian and Venetian) to \"severely endangered\" (Arpitan, most of the Occitan varieties). Since the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, increased sensitivity to the rights of minorities has allowed some of these languages to start recovering their prestige and lost rights. Yet it is unclear whether these political changes will be enough to reverse the decline of minority Romance languages.\n\nClassification and related languages\nupright=1.36|thumb|Chart of Romance languages based on structural and comparative criteria, not on socio-functional ones.

Along with Latin (which is not included among the Romance languages) and a few extinct languages of ancient Italy, they make up the Italic branch of the Indo-European family.\n\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | CLA | | | | VUL |CLA=Classical Latin|VUL=Vulgar Latin}}\n\nProposed divisions\n\n+Extent of variation in development (very conservative to very innovative) Form(\"to sing\")  Latin  NuoreseSardinian  Italian  Spanish  Portuguese  LanguedocienOccitan  CentralCatalan  MilaneseLombard  Romanian  French Infinitive  cant\u0101re  cantare  cantare  cantar  cantar 1  cantar  cantar  cantar  c\u00e2nta(re)  chanter Past participle  cant\u0101tum  cantatu  cantato  cantado  cantado  cantat  cantat  cantad  c\u00e2ntat  chant\u00e9 Gerund  cantandum  cantande  cantando  cantando  cantando  cantant  cantant  cantand  c\u00e2nt\u00e2nd  chantant     cant\u014d  canto  canto  canto  canto  cante  canto  canti  c\u00e2nt  chante     cant\u0101s  cantas  canti  cantas  cantas  cantas  cantes  c\u00e0ntet  c\u00e2n\u021bi  chantes     cantat  cantat  canta  canta  canta  canta  canta  canta  c\u00e2nt\u0103  chante     cant\u0101mus  cantamus  cantiamo  cantamos  cantamos  cantam  cantem  cantom  c\u00e2nt\u0103m  chantons     cant\u0101tis  cantates  cantate  cant\u00e1is  cantais  cantatz  canteu  cantev  c\u00e2nta\u021bi  chantez     cantant  cantant  cantano  cantan  cantam  cantan  canten  canten/canta  c\u00e2nt\u0103  chantent    cantem  cante  canti  cante  cante  cante  canti  canta  c\u00e2nt  chante    cant\u0113s  cantes  canti  cantes  cantes  cantes  cantis  c\u00e0ntet  c\u00e2n\u021bi  chantes    cantet  cantet  canti  cante  cante  cante  canti  canta  c\u00e2nte  chante    cant\u0113mus  cantemus  cantiamo  cantemos  cantemos  cantem  cantem  cantom  c\u00e2nt\u0103m  chantions    cant\u0113tis  cantetis  cantiate  cant\u00e9is  canteis  cantetz  canteu  cantev  c\u00e2nta\u021bi  chantiez    cantent  cantent  cantino  canten  cantem  canten  cantin  canten/canta  c\u00e2nte  chantent   imperative  cant\u0101  canta  canta  canta  canta  canta  canta  canta  c\u00e2nt\u0103  chante   imperative  cant\u0101te  cantate  cantate  cantad  cantai  cantatz  canteu  cantev  c\u00e2nta\u021bi  chantez 1 Also  are all possible allophones of  in this position, as well deletion of the consonant.\n\nThere are various schemes used to subdivide the Romance languages. Three of the most common schemes are as follows:\n Italo-Western vs. Eastern vs. Southern. This is the scheme followed by Ethnologue, and is based primarily on the outcome of the ten monophthong vowels in Classical Latin. This is discussed more below.\n West vs. East. This scheme divides the various languages along the La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line, which runs across north-central Italy just to the north of the city of Florence (whose speech forms the basis of standard Italian). In this scheme, \"East\" includes the languages of central and southern Italy, and the Balkan Romance (or \"Eastern Romance\") languages in Romania, Greece, and elsewhere in the Balkans; \"West\" includes the languages of Portugal, Spain, France, northern Italy and Switzerland. Sardinian does not easily fit in this scheme.\n \"Conservative\" vs. \"innovatory\". This is a non-genetic division whose precise boundaries are subject to debate. Generally, the Gallo-Romance languages (discussed further below) form the core \"innovatory\" languages, with standard French generally considered the most innovatory of all, while the languages near the periphery (which include Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Romanian) are \"conservative\". Sardinian is generally acknowledged the most conservative Romance language, and was also the first language to split off genetically from the rest, possibly as early as the first century BC. Dante famously denigrated the Sardinians for the conservativeness of their speech, remarking that they imitate Latin \"like monkeys imitate men\".Sardos etiam, qui non Latii sunt sed Latiis associandi videntur, eiciamus, quoniam soli sine proprio vulgari esse videntur, gramaticam tanquam simie homines imitantes: nam domus nova et dominus meus locuntur. [\"As for the Sardinians, who are not Italian but may be associated with Italians for our purposes, out they must go, because they alone seem to lack a vernacular of their own, instead imitating gramatica as apes do humans: for they say domus nova [my house] and dominus meus [my master].\" (English translation provided by Dante Online, De Vulgari Eloquentia, I-xi)] It is unclear whether this indicates that Sardinian still had a two-case system at the time; modern Sardinian lacks grammatical case.\n\nItalo-Western vs. Eastern vs. Sardinian\nThe main subfamilies that have been proposed by Ethnologue within the various classification schemes for Romance languages are:\n Italo-Western, the largest group, which includes languages such as Catalan, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, and French.\n Eastern Romance, which includes the Romance languages of Eastern Europe, such as Romanian.\n Southern Romance, which includes a few languages with particularly archaic features, such as Sardinian and, according to some authors, Corsican as well to a more limited extent. This family is thought to have included the now-vanished Romance languages of North Africa (or at least, they appear to have evolved some phonological features and their vowels in the same way).\n\nThis three-way division is made primarily based on the outcome of Vulgar Latin (Proto-Romance) vowels:\n+Outcome of Classical Latin vowels Classical Latin  Proto-Romance  Sardinian Eastern Romance  Italo-Western  short A     long A short E        long E     short I    long I       short O       long O    short U     long U    \n\nItalo-Western is in turn split along the so-called La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line in northern Italy, which divides the central and southern Italian languages from the so-called Western Romance languages to the north and west. The primary characteristics dividing the two are:\n Phonemic lenition of intervocalic stops, which happens to the northwest but not to the southeast.\n Degemination of geminate stops (producing new intervocalic single voiceless stops, after the old ones were lenited), which again happens to the northwest but not to the southeast.\n Deletion of intertonic vowels (between the stressed syllable and either the first or last syllable), again in the northwest but not the southeast.\n Use of plurals in /s/ in the northwest vs. plurals using vowel change in the southeast.\n Development of palatalized /k/ before /e,i/ to  in the northwest vs.  in the southeast.\n Development of , which develops to  >  (sometimes progressing further to ) in the northwest but  in the southeast.\n\nThe reality is somewhat more complex. All of the \"southeast\" characteristics apply to all languages southeast of the line, and all of the \"northwest\" characteristics apply to all languages in France and (most of) Spain. However, the Gallo-Italic languages are somewhere in between. All of these languages do have the \"northwest\" characteristics of lenition and loss of gemination. However:\n The Gallo\u2012Italic languages have vowel-changing plurals rather than /s/ plurals.\n The Lombard language in north-central Italy and the Rhaeto-Romance languages have the \"southeast\" characteristic of  instead of  for palatalized /k/.\n The Venetian language in northeast Italy and some of the Rhaeto-Romance languages have the \"southeast\" characteristic of developing  to .\n Lenition of post-vocalic /p t k/ is widespread as an allophonic phonetic realization in Italy below the La Spezia-Rimini line, including Corsica and most of Sardinia.\n\nOn top of this, the ancient Mozarabic language in southern Spain, at the far end of the \"northwest\" group, had the \"southeast\" characteristics of lack of lenition and palatalization of /k/ to . Certain languages around the Pyrenees (e.g. some highland Aragonese dialects) also lack lenition, and northern French dialects such as Norman and Picard have palatalization of /k/ to  (although this is possibly an independent, secondary development, since /k/ between vowels, i.e. when subject to lenition, developed to /dz/ rather than , as would be expected for a primary development).\n\nThe usual solution to these issues is to create various nested subgroups. Western Romance is split into the Gallo-Iberian languages, in which lenition happens and which include nearly all the Western Romance languages, and the Pyrenean-Mozarabic group, which includes the remaining languages without lenition (and is unlikely to be a valid clade; probably at least two clades, one for Mozarabic and one for Pyrenean). Gallo-Iberian is split in turn into the Iberian languages (e.g. Spanish and Portuguese), and the larger Gallo-Romance languages (stretching from eastern Spain to northeast Italy).\n\nProbably a more accurate description, however, would be to say that there was a focal point of innovation located in central France, from which a series of innovations spread out as areal changes. The La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line represents the farthest point to the southeast that these innovations reached, corresponding to the northern chain of the Apennine Mountains, which cuts straight across northern Italy and forms a major geographic barrier to further language spread.\n\nThis would explain why some of the \"northwest\" features (almost all of which can be characterized as innovations) end at differing points in northern Italy, and why some of the languages in geographically remote parts of Spain (in the south, and high in the Pyrenees) are lacking some of these features. It also explains why the languages in France (especially standard French) seem to have innovated earlier and more completely than other Western Romance languages.\n\nMany of the \"southeast\" features also apply to the Eastern Romance languages (particularly, Romanian), despite the geographic discontinuity. Examples are lack of lenition, maintenance of intertonic vowels, use of vowel-changing plurals, and palatalization of /k/ to . (Gemination is missing, which may be an independent development, and /kt/ develops into /pt/ rather than either of the normal Italo-Western developments.) This has led some researchers to postulate a basic two-way East-West division, with the \"Eastern\" languages including Romanian and central and southern Italian.\n\nDespite being the first Romance language to evolve from Vulgar Latin, Sardinian does not fit at all into this sort of division.Ruhlen M. (1987). A guide to the world's languages, Stanford University Press, Stanford. It is clear that Sardinian became linguistically independent from the remainder of the Romance languages at an extremely early date, possibly already by the first century BC. Sardinian contains a large number of archaic features, including total lack of palatalization of /k/ and /g/ and a large amount of vocabulary preserved nowhere else, including some items already archaic by the time of Classical Latin (first century BC). Sardinian has plurals in /s/ but post-vocalic lenition of voiceless consonants is normally limited to the status of an allophonic rule (e.g. [k]ane 'dog' but su [g]ane or su [\u0263]ane 'the dog'), and there are a few innovations unseen elsewhere, such as a change of /au/ to /a/. Use of su < ipsum as an article is a retained archaic feature that also exists in the Catalan of the Balearic Islands and that used to be more widespread in Occitano-Romance, and is known as  (literally the \"salted article\"), while Sardinian shares delabialization of earlier /kw/ and /gw/ with Romanian: Sard. abba, Rum. ap\u0103 'water'; Sard. limba, Rom. limb\u0103 'language' (cf. Italian acqua, lingua).\n\nGallo-Romance languages\n\nGallo-Romance can be divided into the following subgroups:\n The Langues d'o\u00efl, including French and closely related languages.\n The Franco-Proven\u00e7al language (also known as Arpitan) of southeastern France, western Switzerland, and Aosta Valley region of northwestern Italy.\nThe following groups are also sometimes considered part of Gallo-Romance:\n The Occitano-Romance languages of southern France namely, Occitan and Gascon.\n The Catalan language of eastern Iberia is also sometimes included in Gallo-romance. This is however disputed by some linguists who prefer to group it with Iberian Romance, since although Old Catalan is close to Old Occitan, it later adjusted its lexicon to some degree to align with Spanish. In general however, modern Catalan, especially grammatically, remains closer to modern Occitan than to either Spanish or Portuguese.\n The Gallo-Italian languages of northern Italy, including Piedmontese, Ligurian, Lombard, Emilian and Romagnol. Ligurian retains the final -o, being the exception in Gallo-Romance.\n The Rhaeto-Romance languages, including Romansh, and Friulian, and Ladin dialects.\n\nThe Gallo-Romance languages are generally considered the most innovative (least conservative) among the Romance languages. Characteristic Gallo-Romance features generally developed earliest and appear in their most extreme manifestation in the Langue d'o\u00efl, gradually spreading out along riverways and transalpine roads.\n\nIn some ways, however, the Gallo-Romance languages are conservative. The older stages of many of the languages preserved a two-case system consisting of nominative and oblique, fully marked on nouns, adjectives and determiners, inherited almost directly from the Latin nominative and accusative and preserving a number of different declensional classes and irregular forms. The languages closest to the o\u00efl epicenter preserve the case system the best, while languages at the periphery lose it early.\n\nNotable characteristics of the Gallo-Romance languages are:\n Early loss of unstressed final vowels other than \u2014a defining characteristic of the group.\n Further reductions of final vowels in Langue d'o\u00efl and many Gallo-Italic languages, with the feminine  and prop vowel  merging into , which is often subsequently dropped.\n Early, heavy reduction  of unstressed vowels in the interior of a word (another defining characteristic).\n Loss of final vowels phonemicized the long vowels that used to be automatic concomitants of stressed open syllables. These phonemic long vowels are maintained directly in many Northern Italian dialects; elsewhere, phonemic length was lost, but in the meantime many of the long vowels diphthongized, resulting in a maintenance of the original distinction. The langue d'o\u00efl branch is again at the forefront of innovation, with no less than five of the seven long vowels diphthongizing (only high vowels were spared).\n Front rounded vowels are present in all four branches.  usually fronts to , and secondary mid front rounded vowels often develop from long  or .\n Extreme lenition (i.e. multiple rounds of lenition) occurs in many languages especially in Langue d'o\u00efl and many Gallo-Italian languages.\n The Langue d'o\u00efl, Swiss Rhaeto-Romance languages and many of the northern dialects of Occitan have a secondary palatalization of  and  before , producing different results from the primary Romance palatalization: e.g. centum \"hundred\" > cent , cantum \"song\" > chant .\n Other than the Occitano-Romance languages, most Gallo-Romance languages are subject-obligatory (whereas all the rest of the Romance languages are pro-drop languages). This is a late development triggered by progressive phonetic erosion: Old French was still a null-subject language, and this only changed upon loss of secondarily final consonants in Middle French.\n\nPidgins, creoles, and mixed languages\nSome Romance languages have developed varieties which seem dramatically restructured as to their grammars or to be mixtures with other languages. It is not always clear whether they should be classified as Romance, pidgins, creole languages, or mixed languages. Some other languages, such as Modern English, are sometimes thought of as creoles of semi-Romance ancestry. There are several dozens of creoles of French, Spanish, and Portuguese origin, some of them spoken as national languages in former European colonies.Creoles of French: Antillean (French Antilles, Saint Lucia, Dominica)\n Haitian (one of Haiti's two official languages)\n Louisiana (US)\n Mauritian (lingua franca of Mauritius)\n R\u00e9union (native language of R\u00e9union)\n Seychellois (Seychelles' official language)Creoles of Spanish: Chavacano (in part of Philippines)\n Palenquero (in part of Colombia)Creoles of Portuguese: Angolar (regional language in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe)\n Cape Verdean (Cape Verde's national language; includes several distinct languages)\n Forro (regional language in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe)\n Kristang (Malaysia)\n Macanese (Macau)\n Papiamento (Dutch Antilles official language)\n Upper Guinea (Guinea-Bissau's national language)\n\nAuxiliary and constructed languages\n\nLatin and the Romance languages have also served as the inspiration and basis of numerous auxiliary and constructed languages, so-called \"neo-romantic languages\".\n\nThe concept was first developed in 1903 by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano, under the title Latino sine flexione.Peano, Giuseppe (1903). De Latino Sine Flexione. Lingua Auxiliare Internationale , Revista de Mathematica (Revue de Math\u00e9matiques), Tomo VIII, pp. 74\u201383. Fratres Bocca Editores: Torino. He wanted to create a naturalistic international language, as opposed to an autonomous constructed language like Esperanto or Volapuk which were designed for maximal simplicity of lexicon and derivation of words. Peano used Latin as the base of his language, because at the time of his flourishing it was the de facto international language of scientific communication.\n\nOther languages developed since include Idiom Neutral, Occidental, Lingua Franca Nova, and most famously and successfully, Interlingua. Each of these languages has attempted to varying degrees to achieve a pseudo-Latin vocabulary as common as possible to living Romance languages.\n\nThere are also languages created for artistic purposes only, such as Talossan. Because Latin is a very well attested ancient language, some amateur linguists have even constructed Romance languages that mirror real languages that developed from other ancestral languages. These include Brithenig (which mirrors Welsh), Breathanach (mirrors Irish), Wenedyk (mirrors Polish), \u00derj\u00f3trunn (mirrors Icelandic), and Helvetian (mirrors German).\n\nLinguistic features\n\nBasic features\nRomance languages have a number of shared features across all languages:\n Romance languages are moderately inflecting, i.e. there is a moderately complex system of affixes (primarily suffixes) that are attached to words to convey grammatical information such as number, gender, person, tense, etc. Verbs have much more inflection than nouns. The amount of synthesis is significantly more than English, but less than Classical Latin and much less than the oldest Indo-European languages (e.g. Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Inflection is fusional, with a single affix representing multiple features (as contrasted with agglutinative languages such as Turkish or Japanese). For example, Portuguese amei \"I loved\" is composed of am- \"love\" and the fusional suffix -ei \"first-person singular preterite indicative\".\n Romance languages have a primarily subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order, with varying degrees of flexibility from one language to another. Constructions are predominantly of the head-first (right-branching) type. Adjectives, genitives and relative clauses all tend to follow their head noun, although (except in Romanian) determiners usually precede.\n In general, nouns, adjectives and determiners inflect only according to grammatical gender (masculine or feminine) and grammatical number (singular or plural). Grammatical case is marked only on pronouns, as in English; case marking, as in English, is of the nominative\u2013accusative type (rather than e.g. the ergative\u2013absolutive marking of Basque or the split ergativity of Hindi). A significant exception, however, is Romanian, with two-case marking (nominative/accusative vs. genitive/dative) on nominal elements.\n Verbs are inflected according to a complex morphology that marks person, number (singular or plural), tense, mood (indicative, subjunctive, imperative), and sometimes aspect or gender. Grammatical voice (active, passive, middle/reflexive) and some grammatical aspects (in particular, the perfect aspect) are expressed using periphrastic constructions, as in the Italian present perfect (passato prossimo) io ho amato/io sono stato amato \"I have loved/I have been loved\".\n Most Romance languages are null subject languages (but modern French is not, as a result of the phonetic decay of verb endings).\n All Romance languages have two articles (definite and indefinite), and many have in addition a partitive article (expressing the concept of \"some\"). In some languages (notably, French), the use of an article with a noun is nearly obligatory; it serves to express grammatical number (no longer marked on most nouns) and to cope with the extreme homophony of French vocabulary as a result of extensive sound reductions.\n The phonemic inventory of most Romance languages is of moderate size with few unusual phonemes. Phonemic vowel length is uncommon. Some languages have developed nasal vowels or front rounded vowels.\n Word accent is of the stress (dynamic) type, rather than making use of pitch (as in Ancient Greek and some modern Slavic languages). Stress occurs more or less predictably on one of the last three syllables.\n\nChanges from Classical Latin\n\nLoss of the case system\n\nThe most significant changes between Classical Latin and Proto-Romance (and hence all the modern Romance languages) relate to the reduction or loss of the Latin case system, and the corresponding syntactic changes that were triggered.\n\nThe case system was drastically reduced from the six-case system of Classical Latin. Although five cases can be reconstructed for Vulgar Latin nouns (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and ablative), for Proto-Romance this had been reduced to three: nominative, accusative-ablative, and genitive-dative. This system is preserved best in pronouns. In the West, the genitive-dative disappeared with the genitive replaced by de + ablative and the dative by ad + accusative.Tatiana Fotitch, ed., An Anthology of Old Spanish (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 2018), 9. This left only two cases: nominative and oblique. Some of the older Gallo-Romance languages (in particular, Old French, Old Occitan, Old Sursilvan and Old Friulian, and in traces Old Catalan and Old Venetian) preserved this two-case system well into the literary period, and in Ibero-Romance languages, such as Spanish and Portuguese, as well as in Italian (see under Case), a couple of examples are found which preserve the old nominative. In the East, a genitive-dative made entirely of dative formsTi Alkire & Carol Rosen, Romance Languages: A Historical Introduction (NY: Cambridge UP, 2010), 279; p. 349, note 25: due to preference for the dative of possession. was retained but the nominative and accusative-ablative eventually merged.\n\nConcomitant with the loss of cases, freedom of word order was greatly reduced. Classical Latin had a generally verb-final (SOV) but overall quite free word order, with a significant amount of word scrambling and mixing of left-branching and right-branching constructions. The Romance languages eliminated word scrambling and nearly all left-branching constructions, with most languages developing a rigid SVO, right-branching syntax. (Old French, however, had a freer word order due to the two-case system still present, as well as a predominantly verb-second word order developed under the influence of the Germanic languages.) Some freedom, however, is allowed in the placement of adjectives relative to their head noun. In addition, some languages (e.g. Spanish, Romanian) have an \"accusative preposition\" (Romanian pe, Spanish \"personal a\") along with clitic doubling, which allows for some freedom in ordering the arguments of a verb.\n\nThe Romance languages developed grammatical articles where Latin had none. Articles are often introduced around the time a robust case system falls apart in order to disambiguate the remaining case markers (which are usually too ambiguous by themselves) and to serve as parsing clues that signal the presence of a noun (a function that used to beserved by the case endings themselves).\n\nThis was the pattern followed by the Romance languages: In the Romance languages that still preserved a functioning nominal case system (e.g., Romanian and Old French), only the combination of article and case ending serves to uniquely identify number and case (compare the similar situation in modern German). All Romance languages have a definite article (originally developed from ipse \"self\" but replaced in nearly all languages by ille \"that (over there)\") and an indefinite article (developed from \u016bnus \"one\"). Many also have a partitive article (d\u0113 \"of\" + definite article).\n\nLatin had a large number of syntactic constructions expressed through infinitives, participles, and similar nominal constructs. Examples are the ablative absolute, the accusative-plus-infinitive construction used for reported speech, gerundive constructions, and the common use of reduced relative clauses expressed through participles. All of these are replaced in the Romance languages by subordinate clauses expressed with finite verbs, making the Romance languages much more \"verbal\" and less \"nominal\" than Latin. Under the influence of the Balkan sprachbund, Romanian has progressed the furthest, largely eliminating the infinitive. (It is being revived, however, due to the increasing influence of other Romance languages.)\n\nOther changes\n\n Loss of phonemic vowel length, and change into a free-stressed language. Classical Latin had an automatically determined stress on the second or third syllable from the end, conditioned by vowel length; once vowel length was neutralized, stress was no longer predictable so long as it remained where it was (which it mostly did).\n Development of a series of palatal consonants as a result of palatalization.\n Loss of most traces of the neuter gender.\n Development of a series of analytic perfect tenses, comparable to English \"I have done, I had done, I will have done\".\n Loss of the Latin synthetic passive voice, replaced by an analytic construction comparable to English \"it is/was done\".\n Loss of deponent verbs, replaced by active-voice verbs.\n Replacement of the Latin future tense with a new tense formed (usually) by a periphrasis of infinitive + present tense of hab\u0113re \"have\", which usually contracts into a new synthetic tense. A corresponding conditional tense is formed in the same way but using one of the past-tense forms of hab\u0113re.\n Numerous lexical changes. A number of words were borrowed from the Germanic languages and Celtic languages. Many basic nouns and verbs, especially those that were short or had irregular morphology, were replaced by longer derived forms with regular morphology. Throughout the medieval period, words were borrowed from Classical Latin in their original form (learned words) or in something approaching the original form (semi-learned words), often replacing the popular forms of the same words.\n\nPhonology\n\nVowels\nEvery language has a different set of vowels from every other. Common characteristics are as follows:\n Most languages have at least five monophthongs . The parent language of most of the Italo-Western Romance languages (which includes the vast majority) actually had a seven-vowel system , which is kept in most Italo-Western languages. In some languages, like Spanish and Romanian, the phonemic status and difference between open-mid and close-mid vowels was lost. French has probably the largest inventory of monophthongs, with conservative varieties having 12 oral vowels  can occur only in unstressed syllables, and it tends to be rounded ; it is replaced by  when stressed. and 4 nasal vowels . European Portuguese also has a large inventory, with 9 oral monophthongs , 5 nasal monophthongs , and a large number of oral and nasal diphthongs (see below).\n Some languages have a large inventory of falling diphthongs. These may or may not be considered as phonemic units (rather than sequences of vowel+glide or vowel+vowel), depending on their behavior. As an example, French, Spanish and Italian have occasional instances of putative falling diphthongs formed from a vowel plus a non-syllabic  or  (e.g. Spanish veinte  \"twenty\", deuda  \"debt\"; French paille  \"straw\", caoutchouc  \"rubber\"; Italian potei  \"I could\"), but these are normally analyzed as sequences of vowel and glide.  The diphthongs in Romanian, Portuguese, Catalan and Occitan, however, have various properties suggesting that they are better analyzed as unit phonemes. Portuguese, for example, has the diphthongs , where  (and to a lesser extent ) appear only in some dialects. All except  appear frequently in verb or noun inflections. (Portuguese also has nasal diphthongs; see below.)\n Among the major Romance languages, Portuguese and French have nasal vowel phonemes, stemming from nasalization before a nasal consonant followed by loss of the consonant (this occurred especially when the nasal consonant was not directly followed by a vowel). Originally, vowels in both languages were nasalized before all nasal consonants, but have subsequently become denasalized before nasal consonants that still remain (except in Brazilian Portuguese, where the pre-nasal vowels in words such as cama \"bed\", menos \"less\" remain highly nasalized). In Portuguese, nasal vowels are sometimes analyzed as phonemic sequences of oral vowels plus an underlying nasal consonant, but such an analysis is difficult in French because of the existence of minimal pairs such as bon  \"good (masc.)\", bonne  \"good (fem.)\". In both languages, there are fewer nasal than oral vowels. Nasalization triggered vowel lowering in French, producing the 4 nasal vowels  (although most speakers in France nowadays pronounce  as ). Vowel raising was triggered in Portuguese, however, producing the 5 nasal vowels . Vowel contraction and other changes also resulted in the Portuguese nasal diphthongs  (of which  occurs in only two words, muito  \"much, many, very\", and mui  \"very\"; and  is actually a final-syllable allophones of ).\n Most languages have fewer vowels in unstressed syllables than stressed syllables. This again reflects the Italo-Western Romance parent language, which had a seven-vowel system in stressed syllables (as described above) but only  (with no low-mid vowels) in unstressed syllables. Some languages have seen further reductions: e.g. Standard Catalan has only  in unstressed syllables. In French, on the other hand, any vowel may take prosodic stress.\n Most languages have even fewer vowels in word-final unstressed syllables than elsewhere. For example, Old Italian allowed only , while the early stages of most Western Romance languages allowed only . The Gallo-Romance languages went even farther, deleting all final vowels except . Of these languages, French has carried things to the extreme by deleting all vowels after the accented syllable and uniformly accenting the final syllable (except for a more-or-less non-phonemic final unstressed  that occasionally appears). Modern Spanish now allows final unstressed , and modern Italian allows final unstressed , but they tend to occur largely in borrowed or onomatopoeic words, e.g. guru \"guru\", taxi \"taxi\", Spanish tribu \"tribe\" and esp\u00edritu \"spirit\" (loanwords from Classical Latin), Italian babau \"bogeyman\" (onomatopoeic, cf. English \"boo!\"). The apparent Spanish exception casi \"almost\" originates from Latin quasi \"as if\" < quam s\u012b, and was probably influenced by si \"if\".\n Phonemic vowel length is uncommon. Vulgar Latin lost the phonemic vowel length of Classical Latin and replaced it with a non-phonemic length system where stressed vowels in open syllables were long, and all other vowels were short. Standard Italian still maintains this system, and it was rephonemicized in the Gallo-Romance languages (including the Rhaeto-Romance languages) as a result of the deletion of many final vowels. Some northern Italian languages (e.g. Friulan) still maintain this secondary phonemic length, but in most languages the new long vowels were either diphthongized or shortened again, in the process eliminating phonemic length. French is again the odd man out: Although it followed a normal Gallo-Romance path by diphthongizing five of the seven long vowels and shortening the remaining two, it phonemicized a third vowel length system around 1300 AD in syllables that had been closed with an  (still marked with a circumflex accent), and now is phonemicizing a fourth system as a result of lengthening before final voiced fricatives.\n In modern spoken and literary Romanian, Slavic influences are evident in phonetics and morphology. Phonetic Slavicisms include the iotation of the initial e in words such as el, ea, este pronounced  (compare , without the Slavic iotation effect).\n\nConsonants\nMost Romance languages have similar sets of consonants. The following is a combined table of the consonants of the five major Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian).\n\nKey:\n bold: Appears in all 5 languages.\n italic: Appears in 3\u20134 languages.\n (parentheses): Appears in 2 languages.\n ((double parentheses)): Appears in only 1 language.\n\nNotable changes:\n Spanish has no phonemic voiced fricatives (however,  occur as allophones of  after a vowel and after certain consonants). The equivalent of  merged with , and all the rest became voiceless. It also lost , which became  or  in some other dialects.\n The western languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese) all used to have the affricates , , , . By the fourteenth century or so, these all turned into fricatives except for Spanish and dialectal Portuguese . (Spanish  ended up becoming , at least in Northern and Central Spain; elsewhere, it merged with , as in the other languages.) Romanian  likewise became .\n French, and most varieties of Spanish, have lost  (which merged with ). Romanian merged both  and  into .\n Romanian was influenced by Slavic phonology, most notably in the palatalization of consonants in the plural form (for example pomi  and lupi ).\n\nMost instances of most of the sounds below that occur (or used to occur, as described above) in all of the languages are cognate. However:\n Although all of the languages have or used to have , almost none of these sounds are cognate between pairs of languages. The only real exception is many  between Italian and Romanian, stemming from Latin C- before E or I. Italian also has  from Vulgar Latin -CY-, and from -TY- following a consonant (elsewhere ). Former French  is from Latin C- before A, either word-initial or following a consonant; Spanish  is from Latin -CT-, or from PL, CL following a consonant; former Portuguese  is from Latin PL, CL, FL, either word-initial or following a consonant.\n Italian and former Romanian  (from some instances of Vulgar Latin -DY-) are not cognate with former western  (from lenition of ).\n\n+Romance consonantsBilabialLabio-dentalInterdentalDental/AlveolarPost-alveolarPalatalVelar/UvularGlottal Voiceless  Voiced Voiceless  Voiced Voiceless  Voiced Voiceless  Voiced Voiceless  Voiced Voiceless  Voiced Voiceless  Voiced VoicelessNasal       Plosive                Affricate   ()    (())    ()  Fricative     (())         (()) (())Rhotic        ()Lateral      () Approximant       \n\nLexical stress\nWord stress was rigorously predictable in classical Latin except in a very few exceptional cases, either on the penultimate syllable (second from last) or antepenultimate syllable (third from last), according to the syllable weight of the penultimate syllable. Stress in the Romance Languages mostly remains on the same syllable as in Latin, but various sound changes have made it no longer so predictable. Minimal pairs distinguished only by stress exist in some languages, e.g. Italian Papa  \"Pope\" vs. pap\u00e0  \"daddy\", or Spanish l\u00edmite  \"[a] limit\", present subjunctive limite  \"[that] [I/he] limit\" and preterite limit\u00e9  \"[I] limited\".\n\nErosion of unstressed syllables following the stress has caused most Spanish and Portuguese words to have either penultimate or ultimate stress: e.g. Latin tr\u0113decim \"thirteen\" > Spanish trece, Portuguese treze; Latin am\u0101re \"to love\" > Spanish/Portuguese amar. Most words with antepenultimate stress are learned borrowings from Latin, e.g. Spanish/Portuguese f\u00e1brica \"factory\" (the corresponding inherited word is Spanish fragua, Portuguese fr\u00e1gua \"forge\"). This process has gone even farther in French, with deletion of all post-stressed vowels, leading to consistent, predictable stress on the last syllable: e.g. Latin Stephanum \"Stephen\" > Old French Estievne > French \u00c9tienne ; Latin juvenis \"young\" > Old French juevne > French jeune .  This applies even to borrowings: e.g. Latin fabrica > French borrowing fabrique  (the inherited word in this case being monosyllabic forge < Pre-French *fauriga).\n\nOther than French (with consistent final stress), the position of the stressed syllable generally falls on one of the last three syllables. Exceptions may be caused by clitics or (in Italian) certain verb endings, e.g. Italian telefonano  \"they telephone\"; Spanish entreg\u00e1ndomelo  \"delivering it to me\"; Italian mettiamocene  \"let's put some of it in there\"; Portuguese d\u00e1vamos-vo-lo  \"we were giving it to you\".  Stress on verbs is almost completely predictable in Spanish and Portuguese, but less so in Italian.\n\nNominal morphology\nNouns, adjectives, and pronouns can be marked for gender, number and case. Adjectives and pronouns must agree in all features with the noun they are bound to.\n\nNumber\nThe Romance languages inherited from Latin two grammatical numbers, singular and plural; the only trace of a dual number comes from Latin amb\u014d > Spanish and Portuguese ambos, Old Romanian \u00eembi > Romanian ambii, Old French ambe, Italian ambedue, entrambi.\n\nGender\nMost Romance languages have two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine. The gender of animate nouns is generally natural (i.e. nouns referring to men are generally masculine, and vice versa), but for nonanimate nouns it is arbitrary.\n\nAlthough Latin had a third gender (neuter), there is little trace of this in most languages. The biggest exception is Romanian, where there is a productive class of \"neuter\" nouns, which include the descendants of many Latin neuter nouns and which behave like masculines in the singular and feminines in the plural, both in the endings used and in the agreement of adjectives and pronouns (e.g. un deget \"one finger\" vs. dou\u0103 degete \"two fingers\", cf. Latin digitus, pl. digiti).\n\nSuch nouns arose because of the identity of the Latin neuter singular -um with the masculine singular, and the identity of the Latin neuter plural -a with the feminine singular. A similar class exists in Italian, although it is no longer productive (e.g. il dito \"the finger\" vs. le dita \"the fingers\", l'uovo \"the egg\" vs. le uova \"the eggs\"). A similar phenomenon may be observed in Albanian (which is heavily Romance-influenced), and the category remains highly productive with a number of new words loaned or coined in the neuter ((nj\u00eb) hotel one hotel(m) vs. (tri) hotele three hotels (f)). (A few isolated nouns in Latin had different genders in the singular and plural, but this was an unrelated phenomenon; this is similarly the case with a few French nouns, such as amour, d\u00e9lice, orgue.)\n\nSpanish also has vestiges of the neuter in the demonstrative adjectives: esto, eso, aquello, the pronoun ello (meaning \"it\") and the article lo (used to intensify adjectives). Portuguese also has neuter demonstrative adjectives: \"isto\", \"isso\", \"aquilo\" (meaning \"this [near me]\", \"this/that [near you]\", \"that [far from the both of us]\").\n\nRemnants of the neuter, interpretable now as \"a sub-class of the non-feminine gender\" (Haase 2000:233), are vigorous in Italy in an area running roughly from Ancona to Matera and just north of Rome to Naples. Oppositions with masculine typically have been recategorized, so that neuter signifies the referent in general, while masculine indicates a more specific instance, with the distinction marked by the definite article. In Southeast Umbrian, for example, neuter lo pane is 'the bread', while masculine lu pane refers to an individual piece or loaf of bread. Similarly, neuter lo vinu is wine in general, while masculine lu vinu is a specific sort of wine, with the consequence that mass lo vinu has no plural counterpart, but lu vinu can take a sortal plural form li vini, referring to different types of wine. Phonological forms of articles vary by locale.Haase, Martin. 2000. \"Reorganization of a gender system: The Central Italian neuters\". in Gender in Grammar and Cognition, ed. by Barbara Unterbeck et al., pp. 221\u2013236. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter\n\nCase\nLatin had an extensive case system, where all nouns were declined in six cases (nominative, vocative, accusative, dative, genitive, and ablative) and two numbers. Many adjectives were additionally declined in three genders, leading to a possible 6 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 36 endings per adjective (although this was rarely the case). In practice, some category combinations had identical endings to other combinations, but a basic adjective like bonus \"good\" still had 14 distinct endings.\n\n+ Spanish pronoun inflections Case  \"I\"  \"thou\"  \"oneself\"  \"he\"  \"she\"  \"we\"  \"ye\"  \"they\" Nominative yo  t\u00fa  usted  \u00e9l  ella  nosotros  nosotras  vosotros  vosotras  ellos  ellas Disjunctive m\u00ed  ti  s\u00ed Accusative me  te  se  lo  la  nos  os  los  las Dative le  les Genitive m\u00edo  tuyo  suyo   suyo; de \u00e9l  suyo; de ella  nuestro  vuestro  suyo; de ellos  suyo; de ellas Possessive mi  tu  su su With con conmigo  contigo  consigo  con \u00e9l  con ella  con nosotros(archaic connosco)  con nosotras(archaic connosco)  con vosotros(archaic convosco)  con vosotras(archaic convosco)  con ellos  con ellas\n\nIn all Romance languages, this system was drastically reduced. In most modern Romance languages, in fact, case is no longer marked at all on nouns, adjectives and determiners, and most forms are derived from the Latin accusative case. Much like English, however, case has survived somewhat better on pronouns.\n\nMost pronouns have distinct nominative, accusative, genitive and possessive forms (cf. English \"I, me, mine, my\"). Many also have a separate dative form, a disjunctive form used after prepositions, and (in some languages) a special form used with the preposition con \"with\" (a conservative feature inherited from Latin forms such as m\u0113cum, t\u0113cum, n\u014db\u012bscum).\n\n+ Spanish inflectional classes  \"boy\"  \"girl\"  \"man\"  \"woman\" Singular chico  chica  hombre  mujer Plural chicos  chicas  hombres  mujeres\n\nThe system of inflectional classes is also drastically reduced. The basic system is most clearly indicated in Spanish, where there are only three classes, corresponding to the first, second and third declensions in Latin: plural in -as (feminine), plural in -os (masculine), plural in -es (either masculine or feminine). The singular endings exactly track the plural, except the singular -e is dropped after certain consonants.\n\nThe same system underlines many other modern Romance languages, such as Portuguese, French and Catalan. In these languages, however, further sound changes have resulted in various irregularities. In Portuguese, for example, loss of /l/ and /n/ between vowels (with nasalization in the latter case) produces various irregular plurals (na\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 na\u00e7\u00f5es \"nation(s)\"; hotel \u2013 hot\u00e9is \"hotel(s)\").\n\nIn French and Catalan, loss of /o/ and /e/ in most unstressed final syllables has caused the -os and -es classes to merge. In French, merger of remaining /e/ with final /a/ into , and its subsequent loss, has completely obscured the original Romance system, and loss of final /s/ has caused most nouns to have identical pronunciation in singular and plural, although they are still marked differently in spelling (e.g. femme \u2013 femmes \"woman \u2013 women\", both pronounced ).\n\n+ Romanian noun inflectionsDefiniteness Case \"boy\" \"girl\" Singular  Plural  Singular  PluralIndefinite NominativeAccusative b\u0103iat  b\u0103ie\u021bi  fat\u0103  fete GenitiveDative fete Vocative b\u0103iatule, b\u0103iete  b\u0103ietilor  fato (fat\u0103)  fetelorDefinite NominativeAccusative b\u0103iatul  b\u0103ie\u021bii  fata  fetele GenitiveDative b\u0103iatului  b\u0103ie\u021bilor  fetei  fetelor\n\nNoun inflection has survived in Romanian somewhat better than elsewhere. Determiners are still marked for two cases (nominative/accusative and genitive/dative) in both singular and plural, and feminine singular nouns have separate endings for the two cases. In addition, there is a separate vocative case, enriched with native development and Slavic borrowings (see some examples here) and the combination of noun with a following clitic definite article produces a separate set of \"definite\" inflections for nouns.\n\nThe inflectional classes of Latin have also survived more in Romanian than elsewhere, e.g. om \u2013 oameni \"man \u2013 men\" (Latin homo \u2013 homines); corp \u2013 corpuri \"body \u2013 bodies\" (Latin corpus \u2013 corpora). (Many other exceptional forms, however, are due to later sound changes or analogy, e.g. cas\u0103 \u2013 case \"house(s)\" vs. lun\u0103 \u2013 luni \"moon(s)\"; frate \u2013 fra\u0163i \"brother(s)\" vs. carte \u2013 c\u0103r\u0163i \"book(s)\" vs. vale \u2013 v\u0103i \"valley(s)\".)\n\nIn Italian, the situation is somewhere in between Spanish and Romanian. There are no case endings and relatively few classes, as in Spanish, but noun endings are generally formed with vowels instead of /s/, as in Romanian: amico \u2013 amici \"friend(s) (masc.)\", amica \u2013 amiche \"friend(s) (fem.)\"; cane \u2013 cani \"dog(s)\". The masculine plural amici is thought to reflect the Latin nominative plural -\u012b rather than accusative plural -\u014ds (Spanish -os); however, the other plurals are thought to stem from special developments of Latin -\u0101s and -\u0113s.\n\n+Evolution of case in various Romance languages (Latin bonus \"good\")  Case  Latin  Spanish  Old French  Old Sursilvan  RomanianMasculine singular Nominative bonus bueno buens buns bun Vocative bone Accusative bonum buen biVn Genitive bon\u012b Dative bon\u014d AblativeMasculine plural Nominative bon\u012b buenos buen biVni buni Vocative Accusative bon\u014ds buens buns Genitive bon\u014drum Dative bon\u012bs AblativeFeminine singular Nominative bona buena buene buna bun\u0103 Vocative Accusative bonam Genitive bonae bune Dative Ablative bon\u0101Feminine plural Nominative bonae buenas buenes bunas bune Vocative Accusative bon\u0101s Genitive bon\u0101rum Dative bon\u012bs Ablative\n\nA different type of noun inflection survived into the medieval period in a number of western Romance languages (Old French, Old Occitan, and the older forms of a number of Rhaeto-Romance languages). This inflection distinguished nominative from oblique, grouping the accusative case with the oblique, rather than with the nominative as in Romanian.\n\nThe oblique case in these languages generally inherits from the Latin accusative; as a result, masculine nouns have distinct endings in the two cases while most feminine nouns do not.\n\nA number of different inflectional classes are still represented at this stage. For example, the difference in the nominative case between masculine li voisins \"the neighbor\" and li pere \"the father\", and feminine la riens \"the thing\" vs. la fame \"the woman\", faithfully reflects the corresponding Latin inflectional differences (vic\u012bnus vs. pater, f\u0113mina vs. r\u0113s).\n\nA number of synchronically quite irregular differences between nominative and oblique reflect direct inheritances of Latin third-declension nouns with two different stems (one for the nominative singular, one for all other forms), most with of which had a stress shift between nominative and the other forms: li ber \u2013 le baron \"baron\" (bar\u014d \u2013 bar\u014dnem); la suer \u2013 la seror \"sister\" (soror \u2013 sor\u014drem); li prestre \u2013 le prevoire \"priest\" (presbyter \u2013 presbyterem); li sire \u2013 le seigneur \"lord\" (senior \u2013 seni\u014drem); li enfes \u2013 l'enfant \"child\" (inf\u0101ns \u2013 infantem).\n\nA few of these multi-stem nouns derive from Latin forms without stress shift, e.g. li om \u2013 le ome \"man\" (hom\u014d \u2013 hominem). All of these multi-stem nouns refer to people; other nouns with stress shift in Latin (e.g. amor \u2013 am\u014drem \"love\") have not survived. Some of the same nouns with multiple stems in Old French or Old Occitan have come down in Italian in the nominative rather than the accusative (e.g. uomo \"man\" < hom\u014d, moglie \"wife\" < mulier), suggesting that a similar system existed in pre-literary Italian.\n\nThe modern situation in Sursilvan (one of the Rhaeto-Romance languages) is unique in that the original nominative/oblique distinction has been reinterpreted as a predicative/attributive distinction:\n il hotel ej v\u025b\u0272iws natsionalizaws \"the hotel has been nationalized\"\n il hotel natsionalizaw \"the nationalized hotel\"\n\nPronouns, determiners\nAs described above, case marking on pronouns is much more extensive than for nouns. Determiners (e.g. words such as \"a\", \"the\", \"this\") are also marked for case in Romanian.\n\nMost Romance languages have the following sets of pronouns and determiners:\n Personal pronouns, in three persons and two genders.\n A reflexive pronoun, used when the object is the same as the subject. This approximately corresponds to English \"-self\", but separate forms exist only in the third person, with no number marking.\n Definite and indefinite articles, and in some languages, a partitive article that expresses the concept of \"some\".\n A two-way or three-way distinction among demonstratives. Many languages have a three-way distinction of distance (near me, near you, near him) which, though not paralleled in current English, used to be present as \"this/that/yon\".\n Relative pronouns and interrogatives, with the same forms used for both (similar to English \"who\" and \"which\").\n Various indefinite pronouns and determiners (e.g. Spanish alg\u00fan \"some\", alguien \"someone\", algo \"something\"; ning\u00fan \"no\", nadie \"no one\"; todo \"every\"; cada \"each\"; mucho \"much/many/a lot\", poco \"few/little\"; otro \"other/another\"; etc.).\n\nPersonal pronouns\nUnlike in English, a separate neuter personal pronoun (\"it\") generally does not exist, but the third-person singular and plural both distinguish masculine from feminine. Also, as described above, case is marked on pronouns even though it is not usually on nouns, similar to English. As in English, there are forms for nominative case (subject pronouns), oblique case (object pronouns), and genitive case (possessive pronouns); in addition, third-person pronouns distinguish accusative and dative. There is also an additional set of possessive determiners, distinct from the genitive case of the personal pronoun; this corresponds to the English difference between \"my, your\" and \"mine, yours\".\n\nDevelopment from Latin\nThe Romance languages do not retain the Latin third-person personal pronouns, but have innovated a separate set of third-person pronouns by borrowing the demonstrative ille (\"that (over there)\"), and creating a separate reinforced demonstrative by attaching a variant of ecce \"behold!\" (or \"here is ...\") to the pronoun.\n\nSimilarly, in place of the genitive of the Latin pronouns, most Romance languages adopted the reflexive possessive, which then serves indifferently as both reflexive and non-reflexive possessive. Note that the reflexive, and hence the third-person possessive, is unmarked for the gender of the person being referred to. Hence, although gendered possessive forms do exist\u2014e.g. Portuguese seu (masc.) vs. sua (fem.)\u2014these refer to the gender of the object possessed, not the possessor.\n\nThe gender of the possessor needs to be made clear by a collocation such as French la voiture \u00e0 lui/elle, Portuguese o carro dele/dela, literally \"the car of him/her\". (In spoken Brazilian Portuguese, these collocations are the usual way of expressing the third-person possessive, since the former possessive seu carro now has the meaning \"your car\".)\n\nThe same demonstrative ille is the source of the definite article in most Romance languages (see below), which explains the similarity in form between personal pronoun and definite article. When the two are different, it is usually because of differing degrees of phonological reduction. Generally, the personal pronoun is unreduced (beyond normal sound change), while the article has undergone various degrees of reduction, beginning with loss of one of the two original syllables, e.g. Spanish ella \"she\" < illa vs. la \"the (fem.)\" < -la < illa, or masculine el, developed from il- < illud.\n\nClitic pronouns\nObject pronouns in Latin were normal words, but in the Romance languages they have become clitic forms, which must stand adjacent to a verb and merge phonologically with it. Originally, object pronouns could come either before or after the verb; sound change would often produce different forms in these two cases, with numerous additional complications and contracted forms when multiple clitic pronouns cooccurred.\n\nCatalan still largely maintains this system with a highly complex clitic pronoun system. Most languages, however, have simplified this system by undoing some of the clitic mergers and requiring clitics to stand in a particular position relative to the verb (usually after imperatives, before other finite forms, and either before or after non-finite forms depending on the language).\n\nWhen a pronoun cannot serve as a clitic, a separate disjunctive form is used. These result from dative object pronouns pronounced with stress (which causes them to develop differently from the equivalent unstressed pronouns), or from subject pronouns.\n\nMost Romance languages are null subject languages. The subject pronouns are used only for emphasis and take the stress, and as a result are not clitics. In French, however (as in Friulian and in some Gallo-Italian languages of northern Italy), verbal agreement marking has degraded to the point that subject pronouns have become mandatory, and have turned into clitics. These forms cannot be stressed, so for emphasis the disjunctive pronouns must be used in combination with the clitic subject forms. Friulian and the Gallo-Italian languages have actually gone further than this and merged the subject pronouns onto the verb as a new type of verb agreement marking, which must be present even when there is a subject noun phrase. (Some non-standard varieties of French treat disjunctive pronouns as arguments and clitic pronouns as agreement markers.Henri Wittmann. \u00a0, Proceedings of the International Congress of Linguists 16.0416 (Paris, 20\u201325 juillet 1997). Oxford: Pergamon (CD edition).)\n\nFamiliar\u2013formal distinction\nIn medieval times, most Romance languages developed a distinction between familiar and polite second-person pronouns (a so-called T-V distinction), similar to the former English distinction between familiar \"thou\" and polite \"you\". This distinction was determined by the relationship between the speakers. As in English, this generally developed by appropriating the plural second-person pronoun to serve in addition as a polite singular. French is still at this stage, with familiar singular tu vs. formal or plural vous. In cases like this, the pronoun requires plural agreement in all cases whenever a single affix marks both person and number (as in verb agreement endings and object and possessive pronouns), but singular agreement elsewhere where appropriate (e.g. vous-m\u00eame \"yourself\" vs. vous-m\u00eames \"yourselves\").\n\nMany languages, however, innovated further in developing an even more polite pronoun, generally composed of some noun phrases (e.g. Portuguese vossa merc\u00ea \"your mercy\", progressively reduced to vossemec\u00ea, vosmec\u00ea and finally voc\u00ea) and taking third-person singular agreement. A plural equivalent was created at the same time or soon after (Portuguese vossas merc\u00eas, reduced to voc\u00eas), taking third-person plural agreement. Spanish innovated similarly, with usted(es) from earlier vuestra(s) merced(es).\n\nIn Portuguese and Spanish (as in other languages with similar forms), the \"extra-polite\" forms in time came to be the normal polite forms, and the former polite (or plural) second-person vos was displaced to a familiar form, either becoming a familiar plural (as in European Spanish) or a familiar singular (as in many varieties of Latin American Spanish). In the latter case, it either competes with the original familiar singular t\u00fa (as in Guatemala), displaces it entirely (as in Argentina), or is itself displaced (as in Mexico, except in Chiapas). In the Spanish of the Americas, the gap created by the loss of familiar plural vos was filled by originally polite ustedes, with the result that there is no familiar/polite distinction in the plural, just as in the original t\u00fa/vos system.\n\nA similar path was followed by Italian and Romanian. Romanian uses dumneavoastr\u0103 \"your lordship\", while Italian the former polite phrase sua eccellenza \"your excellency\" has simply been supplanted by the corresponding pronoun Ella or Lei (literally \"she\", but capitalized when meaning \"you\"). As in European Spanish, the original second-person plural voi serves as familiar plural. (In Italy, during fascist times leading up to World War II, voi was resurrected as a polite singular, and discarded again afterwards, although it remains in some southern dialects.)\n\nPortuguese innovated again in developing a new extra-polite pronoun o senhor \"the sir\", which in turn downgraded voc\u00ea. Hence, modern European Portuguese has a three-way distinction between \"familiar\" tu, \"equalizing\" voc\u00ea and \"polite\" o senhor. (The original second-person plural v\u00f3s was discarded centuries ago in speech, and is used today only in translations of the Bible, where tu and v\u00f3s serve as universal singular and plural pronouns, respectively.)\n\nBrazilian Portuguese, however, has diverged from this system, and most dialects simply use voc\u00ea (and plural voc\u00eas) as a general-purpose second-person pronoun, combined with te (from tu) as the clitic object pronoun. The form o senhor (and feminine a senhora) is sometimes used in speech, but only in situations where an English speaker would say \"sir\" or \"ma'am\". The result is that second-person verb forms have disappeared, and the whole pronoun system has been radically realigned. However that is the case only in the spoken language of central and northern Brazil, with the northeastern and southern areas of the country still largely preserving the second-person verb form and the \"tu\" and \"voc\u00ea\" distinction.\n\nArticles\nLatin had no articles as such. The closest definite article was the non-specific demonstrative is, ea, id meaning approximately \"this/that/the\". The closest indefinite articles were the indefinite determiners aliqu\u012b, aliqua, aliquod \"some (non-specific)\" and certus \"a certain\".\n\nRomance languages have both indefinite and definite articles, but none of the above words form the basis for either of these. Usually the definite article is derived from the Latin demonstrative ille (\"that\"), but some languages (e.g. Sardinian, Old Occitan, and Balearic Catalan) have forms from ipse (emphatic, as in \"I myself\"). The indefinite article everywhere is derived from the number \u016bnus (\"one\").\n\nSome languages, e.g. French and Italian, have a partitive article that approximately translates as \"some\". This is used either with mass nouns or with plural nouns\u2014both cases where the indefinite article cannot occur. A partitive article is used (and in French, required) whenever a bare noun refers to specific (but unspecified or unknown) quantity of the noun, but not when a bare noun refers to a class in general. For example, the partitive would be used in both of the following sentences:\n I want milk.\n Men arrived today.\nBut neither of these:\n Milk is good for you.\n I hate men.\nThe sentence \"Men arrived today\", however, (presumably) means \"some specific men arrived today\" rather than \"men, as a general class, arrived today\" (which would mean that there were no men before today). On the other hand, \"I hate men\" does mean \"I hate men, as a general class\" rather than \"I hate some specific men\".\n\nAs in many other cases, French has developed the farthest from Latin in its use of articles. In French, nearly all nouns, singular and plural, must be accompanied by an article (either indefinite, definite, or partitive) or demonstrative pronoun.\n\nDue to pervasive sound changes in French, most nouns are pronounced identically in the singular and plural, and there is often heavy homophony between nouns and identically pronounced words of other classes. For example, all of the following are pronounced : sain \"healthy\"; saint \"saint, holy\"; sein \"breast\"; ceins \"(you) tie around, gird\"; ceint \"(he) ties around, girds\"; ceint \"tied around, girded\"; and the equivalent noun and adjective plural forms sains, saints, seins, ceints. The article helps identify the noun forms saint or sein, and distinguish singular from plural; likewise, the mandatory subject of verbs helps identify the verb ceint. In more conservative Romance languages, neither articles nor subject pronouns are necessary, since all of the above words are pronounced differently. In Italian, for example, the equivalents are sano, santo, seno, cingi, cinge, cinto, sani, santi, seni, cinti, where all vowels and consonants are pronounced as written, and  /s/ and  /t\u0361\u0283/ are clearly distinct from each other.\n\nLatin, at least originally, had a three-way distinction among demonstrative pronouns distinguished by distal value: hic 'this', iste 'that (near you)', ille 'that (over there)', similar to the distinction that used to exist in English as \"this\" vs. \"that\" vs. \"yon(der)\". In urban Latin of Rome, iste came to have a specifically derogatory meaning, but this innovation apparently did not reach the provinces and is not reflected in the modern Romance languages. A number of these languages still have such a three-way distinction, although hic has been lost and the other pronouns have shifted somewhat in meaning. For example, Spanish has este \"this\" vs. ese \"that (near you)\" vs. aquel (fem. aquella) \"that (over yonder)\". The Spanish pronouns derive, respectively, from Latin iste ipse accu-ille, where accu- is an emphatic prefix derived from eccum \"behold (it!)\" (still vigorous in Italy as Ecco! 'Behold!'), possibly with influence from atque \"and\".ipse originally meant \"self\", as in ego ipse or egomet ipse \"I myself\". ipse later shifted to mean \"the\" (still reflected in Sardinian and in the Catalan spoken in the Balearic Islands), and still later came to be a demonstrative pronoun. From -met ipse the emphatic (superlative) form metipsimum was created, later evolving into medisimum and eventually Spanish mismo, French m\u00eame, Italian medesimo, which replaced both Latin ipse \"self\" and idem \"same\". The alternative form metipse eventually produced Catalan mateix, Galician-Portuguese med\u00eas. The more frequent Italian equivalent, however, is stesso, derived from the combination istum-ipsum.\n\nReinforced demonstratives such as accu-ille arose as ille came to be used as an article as well as a demonstrative. Such forms were often created even when not strictly needed to distinguish otherwise ambiguous forms. Italian, for example, has both questo \"this\" (eccu-istum) and quello \"that\" (eccu-illum), in addition to dialectal codesto \"that (near you)\" (*eccu-t\u0113-istum). French generally prefers forms derived from bare ecce \"behold\", as in the pronoun ce \"this one/that one\" (earlier \u00e7o, from ecce-hoc; cf. Italian ci\u00f2 'that') and the determiner ce/cet \"this/that\" (earlier cest, from ecce-istum).\n\nReinforced forms are likewise common in locative adverbs (words such as English here and there), based on related Latin forms such as hic \"this\" vs. h\u012bc \"here\", h\u0101c \"this way\", and ille \"that\" vs. ill\u012bc \"there\", ill\u0101c \"that way\". Here again French prefers bare ecce while Spanish and Italian prefer eccum (French ici \"here\" vs. Spanish aqu\u00ed, Italian qui). In western languages such as Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan, doublets and triplets arose such as Portuguese aqui, ac\u00e1, c\u00e1 \"(to) here\" (accu-h\u012bc, accu-h\u0101c, eccu-h\u0101c). From these, a prefix a- was extracted, from which forms like a\u00ed \"there (near you)\" (a-(i)bi) and ali \"there (over yonder)\" (a-(i)ll\u012bc) were created; compare Catalan neuter pronouns a\u00e7\u00f2 (acce-hoc) \"this\", aix\u00f2 (a-(i)psum-hoc) \"that (near you)\", all\u00f2 (a-(i)llum-hoc) \"that (yonder)\".\n\nSubsequent changes often reduced the number of demonstrative distinctions. Standard Italian, for example, has only a two-way distinction \"this\" vs. \"that\", as in English, with second-person and third-person demonstratives combined. In Catalan, however, a former three-way distinction aquest, aqueix, aquell has been reduced differently, with first-person and second-person demonstratives combined. Hence aquest means either \"this\" or \"that (near you)\"; on the phone, aquest is used to refer both to speaker and addressee.\n\nOld French had a similar distinction to Italian (cist/cest vs. cil/cel), both of which could function as either adjectives or pronouns. Modern French, however, has no distinction between \"this\" and \"that\": ce/cet, cette < cest, ceste is only an adjective, and celui, celle < cel lui, celle is only a pronoun, and both forms indifferently mean either \"this\" or \"that\". (The distinction between \"this\" and \"that\" can be made, if necessary, by adding the suffixes -ci \"here\" or -l\u00e0 \"there\", e.g. cette femme-ci \"this woman\" vs. cette femme-l\u00e0 \"that woman\", but this is rarely done except when specifically necessary to distinguish two entities from each other.)\n\nVerbal morphology\n\n+Correspondence between Latin and Romance tenses Latin  Portuguese  Spanish  Catalan  Occitan  French  Rhaeto-Romance  Italian  Romanian  Sardinian Present indicative Present indicative Present subjunctive Present subjunctive Imperfect indicative Imperfect indicative Imperfect subjunctive Personal infinitive  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  Imperfect subjunctive /Personal infinitive Future indicative \u2014  eres (\"you are\")  \u2014  \u2014  future of \"to be\"in Old French  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 Perfect indicative Preterite  Simple preterite (literary except in some Valencian dialects)  Preterite  Simple past (literary)  \u2014  Preterite (Regional Italian in Tuscany);Accademia della Crusca On the use of the passato remoto (in Italian) Literary Remote Past (Regional Italian in the North); Preterite/Perfect (Regional Italian in the South)  Simple past (literary except in the Oltenian dialect)  In Old Sardinian;only traces in modern lang Perfect subjunctive \u2014 Pluperfect indicative Literary pluperfect  Imperfect subjunctive (-ra form)  \u2014  Second conditionalin Old OccitanUsed sometimes a past conditional; also used in an apodosis (then-clause) when the protasis (if-clause) is in the imperfect subjunctive.

The passive voice, which was mostly synthetic in classical Latin, has been completely replaced with compound forms.\n Owing to sound changes which made it homophonous with the preterite, the Latin future indicative tense was dropped, and replaced with a periphrasis of the form infinitive + present tense of hab\u0113re (to have). Eventually, this structure was reanalysed as a new future tense.\n In a similar process, an entirely new conditional form was created.\n While the synthetic passive voice of classical Latin was abandoned in favour of periphrastic constructions, most of the active voice remained in use. However, several tenses have changed meaning, especially subjunctives. For example:\n The Latin pluperfect indicative became a conditional in Sicilian, and an imperfect subjunctive in Spanish.\n The Latin pluperfect subjunctive developed into an imperfect subjunctive in all languages except Romansh, where it became a conditional, and Romanian, where it became a pluperfect indicative.\n The Latin preterite subjunctive, together with the future perfect indicative, became a future subjunctive in Old Spanish, Portuguese, and Galician.\n The Latin imperfect subjunctive became a personal infinitive in Portuguese and Galician.\n Many Romance languages have two verbs \"to be\". One is derived from Vulgar Latin *essere < Latin esse \"to be\" with an admixture of forms derived from sed\u0113re \"to sit\", and is used mostly for essential attributes; the other is derived from st\u0101re \"to stand\", and mostly used for temporary states. This development is most notable in Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan. In French, Italian and Romanian, the derivative of st\u0101re largely preserved an earlier meaning of \"to stand/to stay\", although in modern Italian, stare is used in a few constructions where English would use \"to be\", as in sto bene \"I am well\". In Old French, the derivatives of *essere and st\u0101re were estre and ester, respectively. In modern French, estre persists as \u00eatre \"to be\" while ester has been lost as a separate verb; but the former imperfect of ester is used as the modern imperfect of \u00eatre (e.g. il \u00e9tait \"he was\"), replacing the irregular forms derived from Latin (e.g. ere(t), iere(t) < erat). In Italian, the two verbs share the same past participle, stato. sed\u0113re persists most notably in the future of *essere (e.g. Spanish/Portuguese/French/etc. ser-, Italian sar-), although in Old French the future is a direct derivation from Latin, e.g. (i)ert \"he will be\" < erit. See Romance copula for further information.\nFor a more detailed illustration of how the verbs have changed with respect to classical Latin, see Romance verbs.\n During the Renaissance, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and a few other Romance languages developed a progressive aspect which did not exist in Latin. In French, progressive constructions remain very limited, the imperfect generally being preferred, as in Latin.\n Many Romance languages now have a verbal construction analogous to the present perfect of English. In some, it has taken the place of the old preterite (at least in the vernacular); in others, the two coexist with somewhat different meanings (cf. English I did vs. I have done). A few examples:\n preterite only: Galician, Asturian, Sicilian, Leonese, Portuguese, some dialects of Spanish;\n preterite and present perfect: Catalan, Occitan, standard Spanish;\n present perfect predominant, preterite now literary: French, Romanian, several dialects of Italian, some dialects of Spanish;\n present perfect only: Romansh\n\nNote that in Catalan, the synthetic preterite is predominantly a literary tense, except in Valencian; but an analytic preterite (formed using an auxiliary vad\u014d, which in other languages signals the future) persists in speech, with the same meaning. In Portuguese, a morphological present perfect does exist but has a different meaning (closer to \"I have been doing\").\n\nThe following are common features of the Romance languages (inherited from Vulgar Latin) that are different from Classical Latin:\n Adjectives generally follow the noun they modify.\n The normal clause structure is SVO, rather than SOV, and is much less flexible than in Latin.\n Many Latin constructions involving nominalized verbal forms (e.g. the use of accusative plus infinitive in indirect discourse and the use of the ablative absolute) were dropped in favor of constructions with subordinate clause. Exceptions can be found in Italian, for example, Latin tempore permittente > Italian tempo permettendo; L. hoc facto > I. ci\u00f2 fatto.\n\nLexicon\n\nLoanwords\nRomance languages have borrowed heavily, though mostly from other Romance languages. However, some, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and French, have borrowed heavily from other language groups. Vulgar Latin borrowed first from indigenous languages of the Roman empire, and during the Germanic folk movements, from Germanic languages, especially Gothic; for Eastern Romance languages, during Bulgarian Empires, from Slavic languages, especially Bulgarian. Notable examples are *blancus \"white\", replacing native albus (but Romansh alv, Dalmatian jualb, Romanian alb); *guerra \"war\", replacing native bellum; and the words for the cardinal directions, where cognates of English \"north\", \"south\", \"east\" and \"west\" replaced the native words septentri\u014d, mer\u012bdi\u0113s (also \"noon; midday nap\"; cf. Romanian meriz\u0103), oriens, and occidens. (See History of French \u2013 The Franks.) Some Celtic words were incorporated into the core vocabulary, partly for words with no Latin equivalent (betulla \"birch\", camisia \"shirt\", cerevisia \"beer\"), but in some cases replacing Latin vocabulary (gladius \"sword\", replacing ensis; cambi\u0101re \"to exchange\", replacing m\u016bt\u0101re except in Romanian and Portuguese; carrus \"cart\", replacing currus; pettia \"piece\", largely displacing pars (later resurrected) and eliminating frustum). Many Greek loans also entered the lexicon, e.g. spatha \"sword\" (Greek:  sp\u00e1th\u0113,.Harper, Douglas. \"spatha\". Online Etymology Dictionary. replacing gladius which shifted to \"iris\", cf. French \u00e9p\u00e9e, Spanish espada, Italian spada and Romanian spat\u0103); cara \"face\" (Greek: \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 k\u00e1ra,. partly replacing faci\u0113s); colpe \"blow\" (Greek: \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 k\u00f3laphos,. replacing ictus, cf. Spanish golpe, French coup); cata \"each\" (Greek:  kat\u00e1,. replacing quisque); common suffixes *-ij\u0101re/-iz\u0101re (Greek:  -izein,. French oyer/-iser, Spanish -ear/-izar, Italian -eggiare/-izzare, etc.), -ista (Greek:  -istes).Wolf Dietrich, \"Griechisch und Romanisch\", Lexikon der romanistischen Linguistik, vol 7: Kontakt, Migration und Kunstsprachen: Kontrastivit\u00e4t, Klassifikation und Typologie, eds. G\u00fcnter Holtus, Michael Metzeltin & Christian Schmitt (T\u00fcbingen: Max Niemeyer, 1998), 121\u201334:123\u20134.\n\nLexical innovation\nMany basic nouns and verbs, especially those that were short or had irregular morphology, were replaced by longer derived forms with regular morphology. Nouns, and sometimes adjectives, were often replaced by diminutives, e.g. auris \"ear\" > auricula (orig. \"outer ear\") > oricla (Sardinian origra, Italian orecchia/o, Portuguese orelha, etc.); avis \"bird\" > avicellus (orig. \"chick, nestling\") > aucellu (Occitan auc\u00e8l, Friulian ucel, Neapolitan auciello, etc.); caput \"head\" > capitium (Portuguese cabe\u00e7a, Spanish cabeza, French chevet \"headboard\"; but reflexes of caput were retained also, sometimes without change of meaning, as in Italian capo \"head\", alongside testa); vetus \"old\" > vetulus > veclus (Dalmatian vieklo, Italian vecchio, Portuguese velho, etc.). Sometimes augmentative constructions were used instead: piscis \"fish\" > Old French peis > peisson (orig. \"big fish\") > French poisson. Verbs were often replaced by frequentative constructions: canere \"to sing\" > cant\u0101re; iacere \"to throw\" > iact\u0101re > *iect\u0101re (Italian gettare, Portuguese jeitar, Spanish echar, etc.); iuv\u0101re > adi\u016bt\u0101re (Italian aiutare, Spanish ayudar, French aider, etc., meaning \"help\", alongside e.g. iuv\u0101re > Italian giovare \"to be of use\"); v\u0113n\u0101r\u012b \"hunt\" (Romanian v\u00e2na, Aromanian avinari) > replaced by *capti\u0101re \"to hunt\", frequentative of capere \"to seize\" (Italian cacciare, Portuguese ca\u00e7ar, Romansh catschar, French chasser, etc.).\n\nMany Classical Latin words became archaic or poetic and were replaced by more colloquial terms: equus \"horse\" > caballus (orig. \"nag\") (but equa \"mare\" remains, cf. Spanish yegua, Portuguese \u00e9gua, Sardinian ebba, Romanian iap\u0103); domus \"house\" > casa (orig. \"hut\"); ignis \"fire\" > focus (orig. \"hearth\"); str\u0101ta \"street\" > r\u016bga (orig. \"furrow\") or callis (orig. \"footpath\") (but str\u0101ta is continued in Italian strada). In some cases, terms from common occupations became generalized: inven\u012bre \"to find\" replaced by affl\u0101re (orig. \"to sniff out\", in hunting, cf. Spanish hallar, Portuguese achar, Romansh dial. anflar, Southern Italian asciare, acchiare, Romanian afla 'to find out'); adven\u012bre \"to arrive\" gave way to plic\u0101re (orig. \"to fold (sails; tents)\", cf. Spanish llegar, Portuguese chegar; Romanian pleca), elsewhere arrip\u0101re (orig. \"to harbor at a riverbank\", cf. Italian arrivare, French arriver) (adven\u012bre is continued with the meaning \"to achieve, manage to do\" as in Middle French aveindre, or \"to happen\" in Italian avvenire) . The same thing sometimes happened to religious terms, due to the pervasive influence of Christianity: loqu\u012b \"to speak\" succumbed to parabol\u0101re (orig. \"to tell parables\", cf. Occitan parlar, French parler, Italian parlare) or fabul\u0101r\u012b ~ f\u0101bell\u0101re (orig. \"to tell stories\", cf. Spanish hablar, Dalmatian favlur, Sardinian faeddare), based on Jesus' way of speaking in parables.\n\nMany prepositions were used as verbal particles to make new roots and verb stems, e.g. Italian estrarre, Aromanian astragu, astradziri \"to extract\" from Latin ex- \"out of\" and trahere \"to pull\" (Italian trarre \"draw, pull\", Aromanian tragu, tradziri), or to augment already existing words, e.g. French coudre, Italian cucire, Portuguese coser \"to sew\", from c\u014dnsuere \"to sew up\", from suere \"to sew\", with total loss of the bare stem. Many prepositions and commonly became compounded, e.g. de ex > French d\u00e8s \"as of\", ab ante > Italian avanti \"forward\". Some words derived from phrases, e.g. Portuguese agora, Spanish ahora \"now\" < h\u0101c h\u014dr\u0101 \"at this hour\"; French avec \"with\" (prep.) < Old French avuec (adv.) < apud hoc \"with that\"; Spanish tama\u00f1o, Portuguese tamanho \"size\" < tam magnum \"so big\"; Italian codesto \"this, that\" (near you) < Old Italian cotevesto < eccum tibi istum approx. \"here's that thing of yours\"; Portuguese voc\u00ea \"you\"Originally formal, now equalizing or informal. < vosmec\u00ea < vossemec\u00ea < Galician-Portuguese vossa mercee \"your mercy\".Likewise Spanish usted < vuestra merced, Catalan vost\u00e8 < vostra merc\u00e8.\n\nA number of common Latin words that have disappeared in many or most Romance languages have survived either in the periphery or in remote corners (especially Sardinia and Romania), or as secondary terms, sometimes differing in meaning. For example, Latin caseum \"cheese\" in the periphery (Portuguese queijo, Spanish queso, Romansh caschiel, Sardinian c\u00e0su, Romanian ca\u015f), but in the central areas has been replaced by form\u0101ticum, originally \"moulded (cheese)\" (French fromage, Occitan/Catalan formatge, Italian formaggio, with, however, cacio also available in much of Italy; similarly (com)edere \"to eat (up)\", which survives as Spanish/Portuguese comer but elsewhere is replaced by mand\u016bc\u0101re, originally \"to chew\" (French manger, Sardinian mandicare alongside pappare, Romanian m\u00e2nca(re)). In some cases, one language happens to preserve a word displaced elsewhere, e.g. Italian ogni \"each, every\" < omnes, displaced elsewhere by t\u014dtum, originally \"whole\" or by a reflex of Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac (e.g. Italian ognuno, Catalan tothom \"everyone\"; Italian ogni giorno, Spanish cada d\u00eda \"every day\"); Friulian va\u00ee \"to cry\" < flere \"to weep\"; Serbo-Croatian (Dubrovnik) otijemna \"sail pole\" < Dalmatian < antenna \"yardarm\". Sardinian in particular preserves many words entirely lost elsewhere, e.g. eja \"yes\" < etiam \"also/yes/indeed\", emmo \"yes\" < immo \"rather/yes/no\", mannu \"big\" < magnus, n\u00e0rrere \"to say\" < narr\u0101re \"to tell\", and domo \"house\" < (abl.) dom\u014d \"at home\". Sardinian preserves some words that were already archaic in Classical Latin, e.g. \u00e0china \"grape\" < acinam, while Sicily and Calabria typically have forms with initial /r/: r\u00e0cina.\n\nLatinisms\nDuring the Middle Ages, scores of words were borrowed directly from Classical Latin (so-called Latinisms), either in their original form (learned loans) or in a somewhat nativized form (semi-learned loans). These resulted in many doublets\u2014pairs of inherited and learned words\u2014such as those in the table below:\n Latin  Romance  Inherited  Latinism fragilis \"fragile\"  French  fr\u00eale \"frail\"  fragile \"fragile\" fabrica \"craft, manufacture\"  French  forge \"forge\"  fabrique \"factory\" fabrica  Spanish  fragua \"forge\"  f\u00e1brica \"factory\" fabrica  Romanian  f\u0103ur\u0103 \"blacksmith (archaic)\" fabric\u0103 \"factory\" l\u0113g\u0101lis \"legal\"  French  loyal \"loyal\"  l\u00e9gal \"legal\" l\u0113g\u0101lis  Spanish  leal \"loyal\"  legal \"legal\" adv\u014dc\u0101tus \"advocate (noun)\"  French  avou\u00e9 \"solicitor (attorney)\"  avocat \"barrister (attorney)\" pol\u012bre \"to polish\"   Portuguese  puir \"to wear thin\"  polir \"to polish\"loc\u0101lis \"place\"Portugueselugar \"place\"local \"place\"\nSometimes triplets arise:  Latin articulus \"joint\" > Portuguese art\u00edculo \"joint, knuckle\" (learned), artigo \"article\" (semi-learned), artelho \"ankle\" (inherited; archaic and dialectal). In many cases, the learned word simply displaced the original popular word: e.g. Spanish crudo \"crude, raw\" (Old Spanish cruo); French l\u00e9gume \"vegetable\" (Old French le\u00fcm);  Portuguese flor \"flower\" (Galician-Portuguese chor). The learned loan always sounds (and, in writing, looks) more like the original than the inherited word does, because regular sound change has been bypassed; likewise, the learned word usually has a meaning closer to that of the original. In French, the stress of the modern form of the learned loan may be on the \"wrong\" syllable vis-\u00e0-vis Latin, whereas the stress of the inherited word always corresponds to the Latin stress: e.g. Latin vipera (stress on /i/) vs. French vip\u00e8re, learned loan, and guivre/vouivre, inherited.\n\nBorrowing from Classical Latin has produced a large number of suffix doublets. Examples from Spanish (learned form first): -ci\u00f3n vs. -zon; -cia vs. -za; -ificar vs. -iguar; -izar vs. -ear; -mento vs. -miento; -tud (< nominative -t\u016bd\u014d) vs. -dumbre (< accusative -t\u016bdine); -\u00edculo vs. -ejo; etc. Similar examples can be found in all the other Romance languages.\n\nThis borrowing also introduced large numbers of classical prefixes in their original form (dis-, ex-, post-, trans-) and reinforced many others (re-, popular Spanish/Portuguese des- < dis-, popular French d\u00e9- < dis-, popular Italian s- < ex-). Many Greek prefixes and suffixes (hellenisms) also found their way into the lexicon: tele-, poli-/poly-, meta-, pseudo-, -scope/scopo, -logie/logia/log\u00eda, etc.\n\nSound changes\n\nConsonants\nSignificant sound changes affected the consonants of the Romance languages.\n\nApocope\n\nThere was a tendency to eliminate final consonants in Vulgar Latin, either by dropping them (apocope) or adding a vowel after them (epenthesis).\n\nMany final consonants were rare, occurring only in certain prepositions (e.g. ad \"towards\", apud \"at, near (a person)\"), conjunctions (sed \"but\"), demonstratives (e.g. illud \"that (over there)\", hoc \"this\"), and nominative singular noun forms, especially of neuter nouns (e.g. lac \"milk\", mel \"honey\", cor \"heart\"). Many of these prepositions and conjunctions were replaced by others, while the nouns were regularized into forms based on their oblique stems that avoided the final consonants (e.g. *lacte, *mele, *core).\n\nFinal -m was dropped in Vulgar Latin. Even in Classical Latin, final -am, -em, -um (inflectional suffixes of the accusative case) were often elided in poetic meter, suggesting the m was weakly pronounced, probably marking the nasalisation of the vowel before it. This nasal vowel lost its nasalization in the Romance languages except in monosyllables, where it became  e.g. Spanish quien < quem \"whom\", French rien \"anything\" < rem \"thing\"; note especially French and Catalan mon < meum \"my (m.sg.)\" pronounced as one syllable ( > *) but Spanish m\u00edo and Portuguese and Catalan meu < meum pronounced as two ( > *).\n\nAs a result, only the following final consonants occurred in Vulgar Latin:\n Final -t in third-person singular verb forms, and -nt (later reduced in many languages to -n) in third-person plural verb forms.\n Final -s (including -x) in a large number of morphological endings (verb endings -\u0101s/-\u0113s/-\u012bs/-is, -mus, -tis; nominative singular -us/-is; plural -\u0101s/-\u014ds/-\u0113s) and certain other words (tr\u0113s \"three\", sex \"six\", cr\u0101s \"tomorrow\", etc.).\n Final -n in some monosyllables (from earlier -m).\n Final -r, -d in some prepositions (e.g. ad, per), which were clitics that attached phonologically to the following word.\n Very occasionally, final -c, e.g. Occitan oc \"yes\" < hoc, Old French avuec \"with\" < apud hoc (although these instances were possibly protected by a final epenthetic vowel at one point).\n\nFinal -t was eventually dropped in many languages, although this often occurred several centuries after the Vulgar Latin period. For example, the reflex of -t was dropped in Old French and Old Spanish only around 1100. In Old French, this occurred only when a vowel still preceded the t (generally  < Latin a). Hence amat \"he loves\" > Old French aime but venit \"he comes\" > Old French vient: the  was never dropped and survives into Modern French in liaison, e.g. vient-il? \"is he coming?\"  (the corresponding  in aime-t-il? is analogical, not inherited). Old French also kept the third-person plural ending -nt intact.\n\nIn Italo-Romance and the Eastern Romance languages, eventually all final consonants were either dropped or protected by an epenthetic vowel, except in clitic forms (e.g. prepositions con, per). Modern Standard Italian still has almost no consonant-final words, although Romanian has resurfaced them through later loss of final  and . For example, am\u0101s \"you love\" > ame > Italian ami; amant \"they love\" > *aman > Ital. amano. On the evidence of \"sloppily written\" Lombardic language documents, however, the loss of final  in Italy did not occur until the 7th or 8th century, after the Vulgar Latin period, and the presence of many former final consonants is betrayed by the syntactic gemination (raddoppiamento sintattico) that they trigger. It is also thought that after a long vowel  became  rather than simply disappearing: n\u014ds > noi \"we\", se(d)\u0113s > sei \"you are\", cr\u0101s > crai \"tomorrow\" (southern Italian). In unstressed syllables, the resulting diphthongs were simplified: can\u0113s >  > cani \"dogs\"; am\u012bc\u0101s >  > amiche  \"(female) friends\", where nominative am\u012bcae should produce **amice rather than amiche (note masculine am\u012bc\u012b > amici not **amichi).\n\nCentral Western Romance languages eventually regained a large number of final consonants through the general loss of final  and , e.g. Catalan llet \"milk\" < lactem, foc \"fire\" < focum, peix \"fish\" < piscem. In French, most of these secondary final consonants (as well as primary ones) were lost before around 1700, but tertiary final consonants later arose through the loss of  < -a. Hence masculine fr\u012bgidum \"cold\" > Old French freit  > froid , feminine frigidam > Old French freide  > froide .\n\nPalatalization\n\nPalatalization was one of the most important processes affecting consonants in Vulgar Latin. This eventually resulted in a whole series of \"\" and  consonants in most Romance languages, e.g. Italian .\n\nThe following historical stages occurred:\n\n Stage  Environment  Consonants affected  Result  Languages affected 1 before  (from e, i in hiatus)  ,   ,   all 2  all remaining, except labial consonants   < ,  < , , ,  all except Sardinian 3  before  ,  ,  4  before   all except Sardinian and Dalmatian 5  before ,   ,   north-central Gallo-Romance (e.g. French, northern Occitan); Rhaeto-Romance\n\nNote how the environments become progressively less \"palatal\", and the languages affected become progressively fewer.\n\nThe outcomes of palatalization depended on the historical stage, the consonants involved, and the languages involved. The primary division is between the Western Romance languages, with  resulting from palatalization of , and the remaining languages (Italo-Dalmatian and Eastern Romance), with  resulting. It is often suggested that  was the original result in all languages, with  >  a later innovation in the Western Romance languages. Evidence of this is the fact that Italian has both  and  as outcomes of palatalization in different environments, while Western Romance has only . Even more suggestive is the fact that the Mozarabic language in al-Andalus (modern southern Spain) had  as the outcome despite being in the \"Western Romance\" area and geographically disconnected from the remaining  areas; this suggests that Mozarabic was an outlying \"relic\" area where the change  >  failed to reach. (Northern French dialects, such as Norman and Picard, also had , but this may be a secondary development, i.e. due to a later sound change  > .) Note that  eventually became /s, z, \u0292/ in most Western Romance languages. Thus Latin caelum (sky, heaven), pronounced  with an initial , became Italian cielo , Romanian cer , Spanish cielo /, French ciel , Catalan cel , and Portuguese c\u00e9u .\n\nThe outcome of palatalized  and  is less clear:\n Original  has the same outcome as palatalized  everywhere.\n Romanian fairly consistently has  <  from palatalized , but  from palatalized .\n Italian inconsistently has  from palatalized , and  from palatalized .\n Most other languages have the same results for palatalized  and : consistent  initially, but either  or  medially (depending on language and exact context). But Spanish has  (phonetically ) initially except before , ; nearby Gascon is similar.\n\nThis suggests that palatalized  >  > either  or  depending on location, while palatalized  > ; after this,  >  in most areas, but Spanish and Gascon (originating from isolated districts behind the western Pyrenees) were relic areas unaffected by this change.\n\nIn French, the outcomes of  palatalized by  and by  were different: centum \"hundred\" > cent  but cantum \"song\" > chant . French also underwent palatalization of labials before : Vulgar Latin  > Old French  (s\u0113pia \"cuttlefish\" > seiche, rubeus \"red\" > rouge, s\u012bmia \"monkey\" > singe).\n\nThe original outcomes of palatalization must have continued to be phonetically palatalized even after they had developed into //etc. consonants. This is clear from French, where all originally palatalized consonants triggered the development of a following glide  in certain circumstances (most visible in the endings -\u0101re, -\u0101tum/\u0101tam). In some cases this  came from a consonant palatalized by an adjoining consonant after the late loss of a separating vowel. For example, mansi\u014dn\u0101tam >  >  >  > early Old French maisnie\u1e0de  \"household\". Similarly, medi\u0113t\u0101tem >  >  >  > early Old French meitie\u1e0d  > modern French moiti\u00e9  \"half\". In both cases, phonetic palatalization must have remained in primitive Old French at least through the time when unstressed intertonic vowels were lost (?8th century), well after the fragmentation of the Romance languages.\n\nThe effect of palatalization is indicated in the writing systems of almost all Romance languages, where the letters have the \"hard\" pronunciation  in most situations, but a \"soft\" pronunciation (e.g. French/Portuguese , Italian/Romanian ) before . (This orthographic trait has passed into Modern English through Norman French-speaking scribes writing Middle English; this replaced the earlier system of Old English, which had developed its own hard-soft distinction with the soft  representing .) This has the effect of keeping the modern spelling similar to the original Latin spelling, but complicates the relationship between sound and letter. In particular, the hard sounds must be written differently before  (e.g. Italian , Portuguese ), and likewise for the soft sounds when not before these letters (e.g. Italian , Portuguese ). Furthermore, in Spanish, Catalan, Occitan and Brazilian Portuguese, the use of digraphs containing  to signal the hard pronunciation before  means that a different spelling is also needed to signal the sounds  before these vowels (Spanish , Catalan, Occitan and Brazilian Portuguese ).Note that the current Portuguese spelling (Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990) abolished the use of the diaeresis for this purpose. This produces a number of orthographic alternations in verbs whose pronunciation is entirely regular. The following are examples of corresponding first-person plural indicative and subjunctive in a number of regular Portuguese verbs: marcamos, marquemos \"we mark\"; ca\u00e7amos, cacemos \"we hunt\"; chegamos, cheguemos \"we arrive\"; averiguamos, averig\u00fcemos \"we verify\"; adequamos, adeq\u00fcemos \"we adapt\"; oferecemos, ofere\u00e7amos \"we offer\"; dirigimos, dirijamos \"we drive\" erguemos, ergamos \"we raise\"; delinquimos, delincamos \"we commit a crime\". In the case of Italian, the convention of digraphs <ch> and <gh> to represent /k/ and /g/ before written <e, i> results in similar orthographic alternations, such as dimentico 'I forget', dimentichi 'you forget', baco 'worm', bachi 'worms' with [k] or pago 'I pay', paghi 'you pay' and lago 'lake', laghi 'lakes' with [g]. The use in Italian of <ci> and <gi> to represent /t\u0283/ or /d\u0292/ before vowels written <a,o,u> neatly distinguishes dico 'I say' with /k/ from dici 'you say' with /t\u0283/ or ghiro 'dormouse' /g/ and giro 'turn, revolution' /d\u0292/, but with orthographic <ci> and <gi> also representing the sequence of /t\u0283/ or /d\u0292/ and the actual vowel /i/ (/dit\u0283i/ dici, /d\u0292iro/ giro), and no generally observed convention of indicating stress position, the status of i when followed by another vowel in spelling can be unrecognizable. For example, the written forms offer no indication that <cia> in camicia 'shirt' represents a single unstressed syllable /t\u0283a/ with no /i/ at any level (/ka\u02c8mit\u0283a/ \u2192 [ka\u02c8mi\u02d0t\u0283a] ~ [ka\u02c8mi\u02d0\u0283a]), but that underlying the same spelling <cia> in farmacia 'pharmacy' is a bisyllabic sequence consisting of the stressed syllable /t\u0283i/ and syllabic /a/ (/farma\u02c8t\u0283ia/ \u2192 [farma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0a] ~ [farma\u02c8\u0283i\u02d0a]).\n\nLenition\n\nStop consonants shifted by lenition in Vulgar Latin in some areas.\n\nThe voiced labial consonants  and  (represented by  and , respectively) both developed a fricative  as an intervocalic allophone.Pope (1934). This is clear from the orthography; in medieval times, the spelling of a consonantal  is often used for what had been a  in Classical Latin, or the two spellings were used interchangeably. In many Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Romanian, etc.), this fricative later developed into a ; but in others (Spanish, Galician, some Catalan and Occitan dialects, etc.) reflexes of  and  simply merged into a single phoneme.\n\nSeveral other consonants were \"softened\" in intervocalic position in Western Romance (Spanish, Portuguese, French, Northern Italian), but normally not phonemically in the rest of Italy (except some cases of \"elegant\" or Ecclesiastical words), nor apparently at all in Romanian. The dividing line between the two sets of dialects is called the La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line and is one of the most important isoglosses of the Romance dialects. The changes (instances of diachronic lenition resulting in phonological restructuring) are as follows:\n\nSingle voiceless plosives became voiced: -p-, -t-, -c- > -b-, -d-, -g-. Subsequently, in some languages they were further weakened, either becoming fricatives or approximants,  (as in Spanish) or disappearing entirely (as  and , but not , in French). The following example shows progressive weakening of original /t/: e.g. v\u012btam > Italian vita , Portuguese vida  (European Portuguese ), Spanish vida  (Southern Peninsular Spanish ), and French vie . Some scholars once speculated that these sound changes may be due in part to the influence of Continental Celtic languages, but scholarship of the past few decades challenges that hypothesis.\n The voiced plosives  and  tended to disappear.\n The plain sibilant -s-  was also voiced to  between vowels, although in many languages its spelling has not changed. (In Spanish, intervocalic  was later devoiced back to ;  is only found as an allophone of  before voiced consonants in Modern Spanish.)\n The double plosives became single: -pp-, -tt-, -cc-, -bb-, -dd-, -gg- > -p-, -t-, -c-, -b-, -d-, -g- in most languages. In French spelling, double consonants are merely etymological, except for -ll- after -i (pronounced [ij]), in most cases.\n The double sibilant -ss-  also became phonetically single , although in many languages its spelling has not changed.\n\nConsonant length is no longer phonemically distinctive in most Romance languages. However some languages of Italy (Italian, Sardinian, Sicilian, and numerous other varieties of central and southern Italy) do have long consonants like , , etc., where the doubling indicates either actual length or, in the case of plosives and affricates, a short hold before the consonant is released, in many cases with distinctive lexical value: e.g. note  (notes) vs. notte  (night), cade  (s/he, it falls) vs. cadde  (s/he, it fell), caro  (dear, expensive) vs. carro  (cart). They may even occur at the beginning of words in Romanesco, Neapolitan, Sicilian and other southern varieties, and are occasionally indicated in writing, e.g. Sicilian cchi\u00f9 (more), and cc\u00e0 (here). In general, the consonants , , and  are long at the start of a word, while the archiphoneme  is realised as a trill  in the same position. In much of central and southern Italy, the affricates /t\u0361\u0283/ and /d\u0361\u0292/ weaken synchronically to fricative [\u0283] and [\u0292] between vowels, while their geminate congeners do not, e.g. cacio  (cheese) vs. caccio  (I chase).\n\nA few languages have regained secondary geminate consonants. The double consonants of Piedmontese exist only after stressed , written \u00eb, and are not etymological: v\u00ebdde (Latin vid\u0113re, to see), s\u00ebcca (Latin sicca, dry, feminine of sech). In standard Catalan and Occitan, there exists a geminate sound  written \u0140l (Catalan) or ll (Occitan), but it is usually pronounced as a simple sound in colloquial (and even some formal) speech in both languages.\n\nVowel prosthesis\nIn Late Latin a prosthetic vowel /i/ (lowered to /e/ in most languages) was inserted at the beginning of any word that began with  (referred to as s impura) and a voiceless consonant (#sC- > isC-): \n scr\u012bbere 'to write' > Sardinian iscribere, Spanish escribir, Portuguese escrever, Catalan escriure, Old French escri(v)re (mod. \u00e9crire);\n spatha \"sword\" > Sard ispada, Sp/Pg espada, Cat espasa, OFr espe\u1e0de (modern \u00e9p\u00e9e); \n spiritus \"spirit\" > Sard isp\u00ecritu, Sp esp\u00edritu, Pg esp\u00edrito, Cat esperit, French esprit;\n Stephanum \"Stephen\" > Sard Ist\u00e8vene, Sp Esteban, Cat Esteve, Pg Est\u00eav\u00e3o, OFr Estievne (mod. \u00c9tienne);\n status \"state\" > Sard istadu, Sp/Pg estado, Cat estat, OFr estat (mod. \u00e9tat). \nProsthetic /i/ ~ /e/ in Romance languages may have been influenced by Continental Celtic languages, although the phenomenon exists or existed in some areas where Celtic was never present (e.g. Sardinia, southern Italy). While Western Romance words undergo prothesis, cognates in Balkan Romance and southern Italo-Romance do not, e.g. Italian scrivere, spada, spirito, Stefano, and stato. In Italian, syllabification rules were preserved instead by vowel-final articles, thus feminine spada as la spada, but instead of rendering the masculine *il spaghetto, lo spaghetto came to be the norm. Though receding at present, Italian once had a prosthetic  if a consonant preceded such clusters, so that 'in Switzerland' was in Svizzera. Some speakers still use the prothetic  productively, and it is fossilized in a few set locutions such as in ispecie 'especially' or per iscritto 'in writing' (although in this case its survival may be due partly to the influence of the separate word iscritto < Latin \u012bnscr\u012bptus). The association of /i/ ~ /j/ and /s/ also led to the vocalization of word-final -s in Italian, Romanian, certain Occitan dialects, and the Spanish dialect of Choc\u00f3 in Colombia.Rodney Sampson, Vowel Prosthesis in Romance: A Diachronic Study (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2010), 63.\n\nStressed vowels\n\nLoss of vowel length, reorientation\n\n Evolution of the stressed vowels in early Romance Classical Proto-Romance WesternRomance BalkanRomance  Sardinian  SicilianAcad.1RomanIPAAcad.1IPA IPA \u012blong i    i     \u0233long y   i (\u012d)short i    \u1eb9   y (y\u0306)short y   \u0113long e     \u0153oe       >  e (\u0115)short e    \u0119    \u00e6ae       >  \u0101long a      a   a (\u0103)short a  o (\u014f)short o      \u01eb       \u014dlong o     \u1ecd     au(a few words)au       >  u (\u016d)short u       \u016blong u      u   au(most words)au       au  1 Traditional academic transcription in Latin and Romance studies, respectively.\nOne profound change that affected Vulgar Latin was the reorganisation of its vowel system. Classical Latin had five short vowels, \u0103, \u0115, \u012d, \u014f, \u016d, and five long vowels, \u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b, each of which was an individual phoneme (see the table in the right, for their likely pronunciation in IPA), and four diphthongs, ae, oe, au and eu (five according to some authors, including ui). There were also long and short versions of y, representing the rounded vowel  in Greek borrowings, which however probably came to be pronounced  even before Romance vowel changes started.\n\nThere is evidence that in the imperial period all the short vowels except a differed by quality as well as by length from their long counterparts.Allen (2003) states: \"There appears to have been no great difference in quality between long and short a, but in the case of the close and mid vowels (i and u, e and o) the long appear to have been appreciably closer than the short.\" He then goes on to the historical development, quotations from various authors (from around the second century AD), as well as evidence from older inscriptions where \"e\" stands for normally short i, and \"i\" for long e, etc. So, for example \u0113 was pronounced close-mid  while \u0115 was pronounced open-mid , and \u012b was pronounced close  while \u012d was pronounced near-close .\n\nDuring the Proto-Romance period, phonemic length distinctions were lost. Vowels came to be automatically pronounced long in stressed, open syllables (i.e. when followed by only one consonant), and pronounced short everywhere else. This situation is still maintained in modern Italian: cade  \"he falls\" vs. cadde  \"he fell\".\n\nThe Proto-Romance loss of phonemic length originally produced a system with nine different quality distinctions in monophthongs, where only original  had merged. Soon, however, many of these vowels coalesced:\n The simplest outcome was in Sardinian,Technically, Sardinian is one of the Southern Romance languages. The same vowel outcome occurred in a small strip running across southern Italy (the Lausberg Zone), and is thought to have occurred in the Romance languages of northern Africa. where the former long and short vowels in Latin simply coalesced, e.g.  > ,  > : This produced a simple five-vowel system .\n In most areas, however (technically, the Italo-Western languages), the near-close vowels  lowered and merged into the high-mid vowels . As a result, Latin pira \"pear\" and v\u0113ra \"true\", came to rhyme (e.g. Italian and Spanish pera, vera, and Old French poire, voire). Similarly, Latin nucem (from nux \"nut\") and v\u014dcem (from v\u014dx \"voice\") become Italian noce, voce, Portuguese noz, voz, and French noix, voix. This produced a seven-vowel system , still maintained in conservative languages such as Italian and Portuguese, and lightly transformed in Spanish (where ).\n In the Eastern Romance languages (particularly, Romanian), the front vowels  evolved as in the majority of languages, but the back vowels  evolved as in Sardinian. This produced an unbalanced six-vowel system: . In modern Romanian, this system has been significantly transformed, with  and with new vowels  evolving, leading to a balanced seven-vowel system with central as well as front and back vowels: .\n Sicilian is sometimes described as having its own distinct vowel system. In fact, Sicilian passed through the same developments as the main bulk of Italo-Western languages. Subsequently, however, high-mid vowels (but not low-mid vowels) were raised in all syllables, stressed and unstressed; i.e. . The result is a five-vowel .\n\nThe Proto-Romance allophonic vowel-length system was rephonemicized in the Gallo-Romance languages as a result of the loss of many final vowels. Some northern Italian languages (e.g. Friulan) still maintain this secondary phonemic length, but most languages dropped it by either diphthongizing or shortening the new long vowels.\n\nFrench phonemicized a third vowel length system around AD 1300 as a result of the sound change /VsC/ > /VhC/ >  (where V is any vowel and C any consonant). This vowel length was eventually lost by around AD 1700, but the former long vowels are still marked with a circumflex. A fourth vowel length system, still non-phonemic, has now arisen: All nasal vowels as well as the oral vowels  (which mostly derive from former long vowels) are pronounced long in all stressed closed syllables, and all vowels are pronounced long in syllables closed by the voiced fricatives . This system in turn has been phonemicized in some non-standard dialects (e.g. Haitian Creole), as a result of the loss of final .\n\nLatin diphthongs\nThe Latin diphthongs ae and oe, pronounced  and  in earlier Latin, were early on monophthongized.\n\nae became  by the 1st century  at the latest. Although this sound was still distinct from all existing vowels, the neutralization of Latin vowel length eventually caused its merger with  < short e: e.g. caelum \"sky\" > French ciel, Spanish/Italian cielo, Portuguese c\u00e9u , with the same vowel as in mele \"honey\" > French/Spanish miel, Italian miele, Portuguese mel . Some words show an early merger of ae with , as in praeda \"booty\" > *pr\u0113da  > French proie (vs. expected **pri\u00e9e), Italian preda (not **prieda) \"prey\"; or faenum \"hay\" > *f\u0113num  > Spanish heno, French foin (but Italian fieno /fj\u025bno/).\n\noe generally merged with : poenam \"punishment\" > Romance * > Spanish/Italian pena, French peine; foedus \"ugly\" > Romance * > Spanish feo, Portuguese feio. There are relatively few such outcomes, since oe was rare in Classical Latin (most original instances had become Classical \u016b, as in Old Latin oinos \"one\" > Classical \u016bnusPalmer (1954).) and so oe was mostly limited to Greek loanwords, which were typically learned (high-register) terms.\n\nau merged with \u014d  in the popular speech of Rome already by the 1st century . A number of authors remarked on this explicitly, e.g. Cicero's taunt that the populist politician Publius Clodius Pulcher had changed his name from Claudius to ingratiate himself with the masses. This change never penetrated far from Rome, however, and the pronunciation /au/ was maintained for centuries in the vast majority of Latin-speaking areas, although it eventually developed into some variety of o in many languages. For example, Italian and French have  as the usual reflex, but this post-dates diphthongization of  and the French-specific palatalization  >  (hence causa > French chose, Italian cosa  not **cuosa). Spanish has , but Portuguese spelling maintains , which has developed to  (and still remains as  in some dialects, and  in others). Occitan, Romanian, southern Italian languages, and many other minority Romance languages still have . A few common words, however, show an early merger with \u014d , evidently reflecting a generalization of the popular Roman pronunciation: e.g. French queue, Italian coda , Occitan co(d)a, Romanian coad\u0103 (all meaning \"tail\") must all derive from c\u014dda rather than Classical cauda (but notice Portuguese cauda).cauda would produce French **choue, Italian , Occitan **cauda, Romanian **caud\u0103. Similarly, Portuguese orelha, French oreille, Romanian ureche, and Sardinian ol\u00edcra, or\u00edcla \"ear\" must derive from \u014dric(u)la rather than Classical auris (Occitan aurelha was probably influenced by the unrelated ausir < aud\u012bre \"to hear\"), and the form oricla is in fact reflected in the Appendix Probi.\n\nFurther developments\n\nMetaphony\n\nAn early process that operated in all Romance languages to varying degrees was metaphony (vowel mutation), conceptually similar to the umlaut process so characteristic of the Germanic languages. Depending on the language, certain stressed vowels were raised (or sometimes diphthongized) either by a final /i/ or /u/ or by a directly following /j/. Metaphony is most extensive in the Italo-Romance languages, and applies to nearly all languages in Italy; however, it is absent from Tuscan, and hence from standard Italian. In many languages affected by metaphony, a distinction exists between final /u/ (from most cases of Latin -um) and final /o/ (from Latin -\u014d, -ud and some cases of -um, esp. masculine \"mass\" nouns), and only the former triggers metaphony.\n\nSome examples:\n In Servigliano in the Marche of Italy, stressed  are raised to  before final /i/ or /u/:  \"I put\" vs.  \"you put\" (< *metti < *mettes < Latin mittis);  \"modest (fem.)\" vs.  \"modest (masc.)\";  \"this (neut.)\" (< Latin eccum istud) vs.  \"this (masc.)\" (< Latin eccum istum).\n Calvallo in Basilicata, southern Italy, is similar, but the low-mid vowels  are diphthongized to  rather than raised:  \"he puts\" vs.  \"you put\", but  \"I think\" vs.  \"you think\".\n Metaphony also occurs in most northern Italian dialects, but only by (usually lost) final *i; apparently, final *u was lowered to *o (usually lost) before metaphony could take effect.\n Some of the Astur-Leonese languages in northern Spain have the same distinction between final /o/ and /u/\u00c1lvaro Arias.

The plural of masculine nouns in these dialects ends in -os, which does not trigger metaphony, unlike in the singular (vs. Italian plural -i, which does trigger metaphony).\n Sardinian has allophonic raising of mid vowels  to  before final /i/ or /u/. This has been phonemicized in the Campidanese dialect as a result of the raising of final /e o/ to /i u/.\n Raising of  to  occurs sporadically in Portuguese in the masculine singular, e.g. porco  \"pig\" vs. porcos  \"pig\".  It is thought that Galician-Portuguese at one point had singular /u/ vs. plural /os/, exactly as in modern Astur-Leonese.\n In all of the Western Romance languages, final /i/ (primarily occurring in the first-person singular of the preterite) raised mid-high  to , e.g. Portuguese fiz \"I did\" (< *fidzi < *fedzi < Latin f\u0113c\u012b) vs. fez \"he did\" (< *fedze < Latin f\u0113cit). Old Spanish similarly had fize \"I did\" vs. fezo \"he did\" (-o by analogy with am\u00f3 \"he loved\"), but subsequently generalized stressed /i/, producing modern hice \"I did\" vs. hizo \"he did\". The same thing happened prehistorically in Old French, yielding fis \"I did\", fist \"he did\" (< *feist < Latin f\u0113cit).\n\nDiphthongization\nA number of languages diphthongized some of the free vowels, especially the open-mid vowels :\n Spanish consistently diphthongized all open-mid vowels  except for before certain palatal consonants (which raised the vowels to close-mid before diphthongization took place).\n Romanian similarly diphthongized  to  (the corresponding vowel  did not develop from Proto-Romance).\n Italian diphthongized  and  in open syllables (in the situations where vowels were lengthened in Proto-Romance), the most salient exception being /\u02c8b\u025bne/ bene 'well', perhaps due to the high frequency of apocopated ben (e.g. ben difficile 'quite difficult', ben fatto 'well made' etc.). \n French similarly diphthongized  in open syllables (when lengthened), along with :  >  > middle OF  > modern .\n French also diphthongized  before palatalized consonants, especially /j/. Further development was as follows: ;  > /uoj/ > early OF /uj/ > modern /\u0265i/.\n Catalan diphthongized  before /j/ from palatalized consonants, just like French, with similar results: , .\n\nThese diphthongizations had the effect of reducing or eliminating the distinctions between open-mid and close-mid vowels in many languages. In Spanish and Romanian, all open-mid vowels were diphthongized, and the distinction disappeared entirely. Portuguese is the most conservative in this respect, keeping the seven-vowel system more or less unchanged (but with changes in particular circumstances, e.g. due to metaphony). Other than before palatalized consonants, Catalan keeps  intact, but  split in a complex fashion into  and then coalesced again in the standard dialect (Eastern Catalan) in such a way that most original  have reversed their quality to become .\n\nIn French and Italian, the distinction between open-mid and close-mid vowels occurred only in closed syllables. Standard Italian more or less maintains this. In French, /e/ and  merged by the twelfth century or so, and the distinction between  and  was eliminated without merging by the sound changes , . Generally this led to a situation where both  and  occur allophonically, with the close-mid vowels in open syllables and the open-mid vowels in closed syllables. This is still the situation in modern Spanish, for example. In French, however, both  and  were partly rephonemicized: Both  and  occur in open syllables as a result of , and both  and  occur in closed syllables as a result of .\n\nOld French also had numerous falling diphthongs resulting from diphthongization before palatal consonants or from a fronted /j/ originally following palatal consonants in Proto-Romance or later: e.g. p\u0101cem /pats\u02b2e/ \"peace\" > PWR */padz\u02b2e/ (lenition) > OF paiz /pajts/; *punctum \"point\" > Gallo-Romance */pon\u02b2to/ > */poj\u0272to/ (fronting) > OF point /p\u00f5jnt/. During the Old French period, preconsonantal /l/ [\u026b] vocalized to /w/, producing many new falling diphthongs: e.g. dulcem \"sweet\" > PWR */dolts\u02b2e/ > OF dolz /du\u026bts/ > douz /duts/; fallet \"fails, is deficient\" > OF falt > faut \"is needed\"; bellus \"beautiful\" > OF bels  > beaus . By the end of the Middle French period, all falling diphthongs either monophthongized or switched to rising diphthongs: proto-OF  > early OF  > modern spelling  > mod. French .\n\nNasalization\nIn both French and Portuguese, nasal vowels eventually developed from sequences of a vowel followed by a nasal consonant (/m/ or /n/). Originally, all vowels in both languages were nasalized before any nasal consonants, and nasal consonants not immediately followed by a vowel were eventually dropped. In French, nasal vowels before remaining nasal consonants were subsequently denasalized, but not before causing the vowels to lower somewhat, e.g. d\u014dnat \"he gives\" > OF dune  > donne , f\u0113minam > femme . Other vowels remained diphthongized, and were dramatically lowered: f\u012bnem \"end\" > fin  (often pronounced ); linguam \"tongue\" > langue ; \u016bnum \"one\" > un .\n\nIn Portuguese, /n/ between vowels was dropped, and the resulting hiatus eliminated through vowel contraction of various sorts, often producing diphthongs: manum, *man\u014ds > PWR *manu, \u02c8manos \"hand(s)\" > m\u00e3o, m\u00e3os ; canem, can\u0113s \"dog(s)\" > PWR *kane, \u02c8kanes > *can, \u02c8canes > c\u00e3o, c\u00e3es ; rati\u014dnem, rati\u014dn\u0113s \"reason(s)\" > PWR *ra\u02c8d\u02b2z\u02b2one, ra\u02c8d\u02b2z\u02b2ones > *ra\u02c8dzon, ra\u02c8dzones > raz\u00e3o, raz\u00f5es  (Brazil),  (Portugal). Sometimes the nasalization was eliminated: l\u016bna \"moon\" > Galician-Portuguese l\u0169a > lua; v\u0113na \"vein\" > Galician-Portuguese v\u1ebda > veia. Nasal vowels that remained actually tend to be raised (rather than lowered, as in French): f\u012bnem \"end\" > fim ; centum \"hundred\" > PWR t\u02b2s\u02b2\u025bnto > cento ; pontem \"bridge\" > PWR p\u0254nte > ponte  (Brazil),  (Portugal). In Portugal, vowels before a nasal consonant have become denasalized, but in Brazil they remain heavily nasalized.\n\nFront-rounded vowels\nCharacteristic of the Gallo-Romance languages and Rhaeto-Romance languages are the front rounded vowels . All of these languages show an unconditional change /u/ > /y/, e.g. l\u016bnam > French lune , Occitan . Many of the languages in Switzerland and Italy show the further change /y/ > /i/. Also very common is some variation of the French development  (lengthened in open syllables) >  > , with mid back vowels diphthongizing in some circumstances and then re-monophthongizing into mid-front rounded vowels. (French has both  and , with  developing from  in certain circumstances.)\n\nUnstressed vowels\n\n+Evolution of unstressed vowels in early Italo-Western Romance Latin Proto-Romance Stressed Non-finalunstressed Final-unstressed Original LaterItalo-Romance LaterWestern-Romance Gallo-Romance PrimitiveFrenchIPAAcad.1IPA a,\u0101   a     e,ae   \u0119        \u2205;  (prop) \u2205;  (prop) \u0113,oe   \u1eb9   i,y  \u012b,\u0233   i   o   \u01eb         \u014d,(au)   \u1ecd   u    \u016b   u  au(most words)   au  N/A 1 Traditional academic transcription in Romance studies.\n\nThere was more variability in the result of the unstressed vowels. Originally in Proto-Romance, the same nine vowels developed in unstressed as stressed syllables, and in Sardinian, they coalesced into the same five vowels in the same way.\n\nIn Italo-Western Romance, however, vowels in unstressed syllables were significantly different from stressed vowels, with yet a third outcome for final unstressed syllables. In non-final unstressed syllables, the seven-vowel system of stressed syllables developed, but then the low-mid vowels  merged into the high-mid vowels . This system is still preserved, largely or completely, in all of the conservative Romance languages (e.g. Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan).\n\nIn final unstressed syllables, results were somewhat complex. One of the more difficult issues is the development of final short -u, which appears to have been raised to  rather than lowered to , as happened in all other syllables. However, it is possible that in reality, final  comes from long *-\u016b < -um, where original final -m caused vowel lengthening as well as nasalization. Evidence of this comes from Rhaeto-Romance, in particular Sursilvan, which preserves reflexes of both final -us and -um, and where the latter, but not the former, triggers metaphony. This suggests the development -us >  > , but -um >  > .Note that the outcome of -am -em -om would be the same regardless of whether lengthening occurred, and that -im was already rare in Classical Latin, and appears to have barely survived in Proto-Romance. The only likely survival is in \"-teen\" numerals such as tr\u0113decim \"thirteen\" > Italian tredici. This favors the vowel-lengthening hypothesis -im >  > ; but notice unexpected decem > Italian dieci (rather than expected *diece). It is possible that dieci comes from *decim, which analogically replaced decem based on the -decim ending; but it is also possible that the final /i/ in dieci represents an irregular development of some other sort and that the process of analogy worked in the other direction.\n\n+Examples of evolution of final unstressed vowels:From least- to most-changed languagesEnglish Latin  Proto-Italo-Western1  ConservativeCentral Italian1  Italian  Spanish  Catalan  Old French a, e, i, o, u  a, e, i, o, u  a, e, i, o  a, e/-, o  a, -/e  e, -/e one (fem.)  \u016bnam  \u02c8una  una  una  una  una  une door  portam  \u02c8p\u0254rta  p\u0254rta  porta  puerta  porta  porte seven  septem  \u02c8s\u025btte  s\u025btte  sette  siete  set  set sea  mare  \u02c8mare  mare  mare  mar  mar  mer peace  p\u0101cem  \u02c8pat\u0283e  pace  pace  paz  pau  paiz part  partem  \u02c8parte  parte  parte  parte  part  part mother  m\u0101trem  \u02c8matre  matre  madre  madre  mare  me\u1e0dre twenty  v\u012bgint\u012b  ve\u02c8enti  vinti  venti  veinte  vint  vint four  quattuor  \u02c8kwattro  quattro  quattro  cuatro  quatre  quatre eight  oct\u014d  \u02c8\u0254kto  \u0254tto  otto  ocho  vuit  huit when  quand\u014d  \u02c8kwando  quando  quando  cuando  quan  quant fourth  quartum  \u02c8kwartu  quartu  quarto  cuarto  quart  quart one (masc.)  \u016bnum  \u02c8unu  unu  uno  uno  un  un port  portum  \u02c8p\u0254rtu  portu  porto  puerto  port  port 1 These columns use IPA symbols /\u0254, \u025b/ to indicate open-mid vowels.\n\nThe original five-vowel system in final unstressed syllables was preserved as-is in some of the more conservative central Italian languages, but in most languages there was further coalescence:\n In Tuscan (including standard Italian), final /u/ merged into /o/.\n In the Western Romance languages, final /i/ eventually merged into /e/ (although final /i/ triggered metaphony before that, e.g. Spanish hice, Portuguese fiz \"I did\" < *fize < Latin f\u0113c\u012b). Conservative languages like Spanish largely maintain that system, but drop final /e/ after certain single consonants, e.g. /r/, /l/, /n/, /d/, /z/ (< palatalized c).\n In the Gallo-Romance languages (part of Western Romance), final /o/ and /e/ were dropped entirely unless that produced an impossible final cluster (e.g. /tr/), in which case a \"prop vowel\" /e/ was added. This left only two final vowels: /a/ and prop vowel /e/. Catalan preserves this system.\n Loss of final stressless vowels in Venetian shows a pattern intermediate between Central Italian and the Gallo-Italic branch, and the environments for vowel deletion vary considerably depending on the dialect. In the table above, final /e/ is uniformly absent in mar, absent in some dialects in part(e) /part(e)/ and set(e) /s\u025bt(e)/, but retained in mare (< Latin m\u0101trem) as a relic of the earlier cluster *dr.\n In primitive Old French (one of the Gallo-Romance languages), these two remaining vowels merged into .\n\nVarious later changes happened in individual languages, e.g.:\n In French, most final consonants were dropped, and then final  was also dropped. The  is still preserved in spelling as a final silent -e, whose main purpose is to signal that the previous consonant is pronounced, e.g. port \"port\"  vs. porte \"door\" . These changes also eliminated the difference between singular and plural in most words: ports \"ports\" (still ), portes \"doors\" (still ). Final consonants reappear in liaison contexts (in close connection with a following vowel-initial word), e.g. nous  \"we\" vs. nous avons  \"we have\", il fait  \"he does\" vs. fait-il ?  \"does he?\".\n In Portuguese, final unstressed /o/ and /u/ were apparently preserved intact for a while, since final unstressed /u/, but not /o/ or /os/, triggered metaphony (see above). Final-syllable unstressed /o/ was raised in preliterary times to /u/, but always still written . At some point (perhaps in late Galician-Portuguese), final-syllable unstressed /e/ was raised to /i/ (but still written ); this remains in Brazilian Portuguese, but has developed to  in European Portuguese.\n In Catalan, final unstressed  > . In many dialects, unstressed  and  merge into  as in Portuguese, and unstressed  and  merge into . However, some dialects preserve the original five-vowel system, most notably standard Valencian.\n\nIntertonic vowels\nThe so-called intertonic vowels are word-internal unstressed vowels, i.e. not in the initial, final, or tonic (i.e. stressed) syllable, hence intertonic. Intertonic vowels were the most subject to loss or modification. Already in Vulgar Latin intertonic vowels between a single consonant and a following /r/ or /l/ tended to drop: v\u00e9tulum \"old\" > veclum > Dalmatian vieklo, Sicilian vecchiu, Portuguese velho. But many languages ultimately dropped almost all intertonic vowels.\n\nGenerally, those languages south and east of the La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line (Romanian and Central-Southern Italian) maintained intertonic vowels, while those to the north and west (Western Romance) dropped all except /a/. Standard Italian generally maintained intertonic vowels, but typically raised unstressed /e/ > /i/.

Old French aidier \"to help\" vs. aiue \"he helps\")\nPortuguese is more conservative in maintaining some intertonic vowels other than /a/: e.g. *offer\u1e17scere \"to offer\" > Portuguese oferecer vs. Spanish ofrecer, French offrir (< *offer\u012bre). French, on the other hand, drops even intertonic /a/ after the stress: St\u00e9phanum \"Stephen\" > Spanish Esteban but Old French Estievne > French \u00c9tienne. Many cases of /a/ before the stress also ultimately dropped in French: sacram\u00e9ntum \"sacrament\" > Old French sairement > French serment \"oath\".\n\nWriting systems\n\nThe Romance languages for the most part have kept the writing system of Latin, adapting it to their evolution.\nOne exception was Romanian before the nineteenth century, where, after the Roman retreat, literacy was reintroduced through the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet, a Slavic influence. A Cyrillic alphabet was also used for Romanian (Moldovan) in the USSR. The non-Christian populations of Spain also used the scripts of their religions (Arabic and Hebrew) to write Romance languages such as Ladino and Mozarabic in aljamiado.\n\n Letters \n+Spelling of results of palatalization and related sounds Sound  Spanish  Portuguese  French  Italian  Romanian , not +    palatalized  (), +    palatalized  (), not +        , not +         +  (inherited)      +  (learned)    Formerly  in Brazilian Portuguese   , not +    palatalized (), +    palatalized (), not +        , not +     +  (inherited)      +  (learned)    Formerly  in Brazilian Portuguese (former)           \u2014         \u2014\n\nThe Romance languages are written with the classical Latin alphabet of 23 letters\u00a0\u2013 A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, X, Y, Z\u00a0\u2013 subsequently modified and augmented in various ways. In particular, the single Latin letter V split into V (consonant) and U (vowel), and the letter I split into I and J. The Latin letter K and the new letter W, which came to be widely used in Germanic languages, are seldom used in most Romance languages\u00a0\u2013 mostly for unassimilated foreign names and words. Indeed, in Italian prose  is properly . Catalan eschews importation of \"foreign\" letters more than most languages. Thus Wikipedia is  in Catalan but  in Spanish.\n\nWhile most of the 23 basic Latin letters have maintained their phonetic value, for some of them it has diverged considerably; and the new letters added since the Middle Ages have been put to different uses in different scripts. Some letters, notably H and Q, have been variously combined in digraphs or trigraphs (see below) to represent phonetic phenomena that could not be recorded with the basic Latin alphabet, or to get around previously established spelling conventions. Most languages added auxiliary marks (diacritics) to some letters, for these and other purposes.\n\nThe spelling rules of most Romance languages are fairly simple, and consistent within any language. Since the spelling systems are based on phonemic structures rather than phonetics, however, the actual pronunciation of what is represented in standard orthography can be subject to considerable regional variation, as well as to allophonic differentiation by position in the word or utterance. Among the letters representing the most conspicuous phonological variations, between Romance languages or with respect to Latin, are the following:\n\n B, V: Merged in Spanish and most dialects of Catalan, where both letters represent a single phoneme pronounced as either  or  depending on position, with no differentiation between B and V. \n C: Generally a \"hard\" , but \"soft\" (fricative or affricate) before e, i, or y.\n G: Generally a \"hard\" , but \"soft\" (fricative or affricate) before e, i, or y. In some languages, like Spanish, the hard g, phonemically , is pronounced as a fricative  after vowels. In Romansch, the soft g is a voiced palatal plosive  or a voiced alveolo-palatal affricate .\n H: Silent in most languages; used to form various digraphs. But represents  in Romanian, Walloon and Gascon Occitan.\n J: Represents the fricative  in most languages, or the palatal approximant  in Romansh and in several of the languages of Italy. Italian does not use this letter in native words. \n Q: As in Latin, its phonetic value is that of a hard c, i.e. , and in native words it is almost always followed by a (sometimes silent) u. Romanian does not use this letter in native words.\n S: Generally voiceless , but voiced  between vowels in some languages. In Spanish, Romanian, Galician and several varieties of Italian, however, it is always pronounced voiceless between vowels. If the phoneme /s/ is represented by the letter S, predictable assimilations are normally not shown (e.g. Italian  'sled', spelled slitta but pronounced , never with ). Also at the end of syllables it may represent special allophonic pronunciations. In Romansh, it also stands for a voiceless or voiced fricative,  or , before certain consonants.\n W: No Romance language uses this letter in native words, with the exception of Walloon.\n X: Its pronunciation is rather variable, both between and within languages. In the Middle Ages, the languages of Iberia used this letter to denote the voiceless postalveolar fricative , which is still the case in Modern Catalan and Portuguese. With the Renaissance the classical pronunciation \u00a0\u2013 or similar consonant clusters, such as , , or \u00a0\u2013 were frequently reintroduced in latinisms and hellenisms. In Venetian it represents , and in Ligurian the voiced postalveolar fricative . Italian does not use this letter in native words.\n Y: This letter is not used in most languages, with the prominent exceptions of French and Spanish, where it represents  before vowels (or various similar fricatives such as the palatal fricative , in Spanish), and the vowel  or semivowel  elsewhere.\n Z: In most languages it represents the sound .  However, in Italian it denotes the affricates  and  (which are two separate phonemes, but rarely contrast; among the few examples of minimal pairs are  \"ray\" with ,  \"race\" with  (note that both are phonetically long between vowels); in Romansh the voiceless affricate ; and in Galician and Spanish it denotes either the voiceless dental fricative  or .\n\nOtherwise, letters that are not combined as digraphs generally represent the same phonemes as suggested by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), whose design was, in fact, greatly influenced by Romance spelling systems.\n\nDigraphs and trigraphs\nSince most Romance languages have more sounds than can be accommodated in the Roman Latin alphabet they all resort to the use of digraphs and trigraphs\u00a0\u2013 combinations of two or three letters with a single phonemic value. The concept (but not the actual combinations) is derived from Classical Latin, which used, for example, TH, PH, and CH when transliterating the Greek letters \"\u03b8\", \"\u03d5\" (later \"\u03c6\"), and \"\u03c7\". These were once aspirated sounds in Greek before changing to corresponding fricatives, and the H represented what sounded to the Romans like an  following , , and  respectively. Some of the digraphs used in modern scripts are:CI: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican and Romanian to represent  before A, O, or U.CH: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican, Romanian, Romansh and Sardinian to represent  before E or I (including yod );  in Occitan, Spanish, Astur-leonese and Galician;  or  in Romansh before A, O or U; and  in most other languages. In Catalan it is used in some old spelling conventions for .DD: used in Sicilian and Sardinian to represent the voiced retroflex plosive . In recent history more accurately transcribed as DDH.DJ: used in Walloon and Catalan for .GI: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican and Romanian to represent  before A, O, or U, and in Romansh to represent  or  or (before A, E, O, and U)  or GH: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican, Romanian, Romansh and Sardinian to represent  before E or I (including yod ), and in Galician for the voiceless pharyngeal fricative  (not standard sound).GL: used in Romansh before consonants and I and at the end of words for .GLI: used in Italian and Corsican for  and Romansh for .GN: used in French, some Romance languages in Italy, Corsican and Romansh for , as in champignon; in Italian to represent , as in \"ogni\" or \"lo gnocco\".GU: used before E or I to represent  or  in all Romance languages except Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican, Romansh, and Romanian, which use GH instead.IG: used at the end of word in Catalan for , as in maig, safareig or enmig.IX: used between vowels or at the end of word in Catalan for , as in caixa or calaix.LH: used in Portuguese and Occitan .LL: used in Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Astur-leonese, Norman and Dg\u00e8rn\u00e9siais, originally for  which has merged in some cases with . Represents  in French unless it follows I (i) when it represents  (or  in some dialects). As in Italian, it is used in Occitan for a long .L\u00b7L: used in Catalan for a geminate consonant .NH: used in Portuguese and Occitan for , used in official Galician for  .N-: used in Piedmontese and Ligurian for  between two vowels.NN: used in Leonese for , in Italian for geminate .NY: used in Catalan for .QU: represents  in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, and Romansh;  in French, Astur-leonese (normally before e or i);  (before e or i) or  (normally before a or o) in Occitan, Catalan and Portuguese;  in Spanish (always before e or i).RR: used between vowels in several languages (Occitan, Catalan, Spanish...) to denote a trilled  or a guttural R, instead of the flap .SC: used before E or I in Italian, Romance languages in Italy as , in European Portuguese as  and in French, Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan and Latin American Spanish as  in words of certain etymology (notice this would represent  in standard peninsular Spanish)SCH: used in Romansh for  or , in Italian for  before \"E\"or \"I\", including yod .SCI: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, and Corsican to represent  before A, O, or U.SH: used in Aranese Occitan for .SS: used in French, Portuguese, Piedmontese, Romansh, Occitan, and Catalan for  between vowels, in Italian, Romance languages of Italy, and Corsican for long .TS: used in Catalan for .TG: used in Romansh for  or . In Catalan is used for  before E and I, as in metge or fetge.TH: used in J\u00e8rriais for ; used in Aranese for either  or .TJ: used between vowels and before A, O or U, in Catalan for , as in sotjar or mitj\u00f3.TSCH: used in Romansh for .TX: used at the beginning or at the end of word or between vowels in Catalan for , as in txec, esquitx or atxa.TZ: used in Catalan for .\n\nWhile the digraphs CH, PH, RH and TH were at one time used in many words of Greek origin, most languages have now replaced them with C/QU, F, R and T. Only French has kept these etymological spellings, which now represent  or , ,  and , respectively.\n\nDouble consonants\nGemination, in the languages where it occurs, is usually indicated by doubling the consonant, except when it does not contrast phonemically with the corresponding short consonant, in which case gemination is not indicated. In J\u00e8rriais, long consonants are marked with an apostrophe:  is a long ,  is a long , and  is a long . The phonemic contrast between geminate and single consonants is widespread in Italian, and normally indicated in the traditional orthography:   'done' vs.   'fate, destiny';   's/he, it fell' vs.   's/he, it falls'. The double consonants in French orthography, however, are merely etymological. In Catalan, the gemination of  is marked by a  (\"flying point\"): .\n\nDiacritics\nRomance languages also introduced various marks (diacritics) that may be attached to some letters, for various purposes. In some cases, diacritics are used as an alternative to digraphs and trigraphs; namely to represent a larger number of sounds than would be possible with the basic alphabet, or to distinguish between sounds that were previously written the same. Diacritics are also used to mark word stress, to indicate exceptional pronunciation of letters in certain words, and to distinguish words with same pronunciation (homophones).\n\nDepending on the language, some letter-diacritic combinations may be considered distinct letters, e.g. for the purposes of lexical sorting. This is the case, for example, of Romanian \u0219 () and Spanish \u00f1 ().\n\nThe following are the most common use of diacritics in Romance languages.\n\n Vowel quality: the system of marking close-mid vowels with an acute accent, \u00e9, and open-mid vowels with a grave accent, \u00e8, is widely used (e.g. Catalan, French, Italian). Portuguese, however, uses the circumflex (\u00ea) for the former, and the acute (\u00e9), for the latter.  Some minority Romance languages use an umlaut (diaeresis mark) in the case of \u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc to indicate fronted vowel variants, as in German.  Centralized vowels () are indicated variously (\u00e2 in Portuguese, \u0103/\u00ee in Romanian, \u00eb in Piedmontese, etc.).  In French, Occitan and Romanian, these accents are used whenever necessary to distinguish the appropriate vowel quality, but in the other languages, they are used only when it is necessary to mark unpredictable stress, or in some cases to distinguish homophones.\n Vowel length: French uses a circumflex to indicate what had been a long vowel (although nowadays this rather indicates a difference in vowel quality, if it has any effect at all on pronunciation).  This same usage is found in some minority languages.\n Nasality: Portuguese marks nasal vowels with a tilde (\u00e3) when they occur before other written vowels and in some other instances.\n Palatalization: some historical palatalizations are indicated with the cedilla (\u00e7) in French, Catalan, Occitan and Portuguese. In Spanish and several other world languages influenced by it, the grapheme \u00f1 represents a palatal nasal consonant.\n Separate pronunciation: when a vowel and another letter that would normally be combined into a digraph with a single sound are exceptionally pronounced apart, this is often indicated with a diaeresis mark on the vowel. This is particularly common in the case of g\u00fc /gw/ before e or i, because plain gu in this case would be pronounced /g/. This usage occurs in Spanish, French, Catalan and Occitan, and occurred before the 2009 spelling reform in Brazilian Portuguese.  French also uses the diaeresis on the second of two adjacent vowels to indicate that both are pronounced separately, as in No\u00ebl \"Christmas\" and ha\u00efr \"to hate\".\n Stress: the stressed vowel in a polysyllabic word may be indicated with an accent, when it cannot be predicted by rule.  In Italian, Portuguese and Catalan, the choice of accent (acute, grave or circumflex) may depend on vowel quality.  When no quality needs to be indicated, an acute accent is normally used (\u00fa), but Italian and Romansh use a grave accent (\u00f9).  Portuguese puts a diacritic on all stressed monosyllables that end in a e o as es os, to distinguish them from unstressed function words: ch\u00e1 \"tea\", m\u00e1s \"bad (fem. pl.)\", s\u00e9 \"seat (of government)\", d\u00ea \"give! (imperative)\", m\u00eas \"month\", s\u00f3 \"only\", n\u00f3s \"we\" (cf. mas \"but\", se \"if/oneself\", de \"of\", nos \"us\"). Word-final stressed vowels in polysyllables are marked by the grave accent in Italian, thus universit\u00e0 \"university/universities\", virt\u00f9 \"virtue/virtues\", resulting in occasional minimal or near-minimal pairs such as parlo \"I speak\" \u2260 parl\u00f2 \"s/he spoke\", capi \"heads, bosses\" \u2260 cap\u00ec \"s/he understood\", gravita \"it, s'/he gravitates\" \u2260 gravit\u00e0 \"gravity, seriousness\".   \n Homophones: words (especially monosyllables) that are pronounced exactly or nearly the same way and are spelled identically, but have different meanings, can be differentiated by a diacritic. Typically, if one of the pair is stressed and the other isn't, the stressed word gets the diacritic, using the appropriate diacritic for notating stressed syllables (see above). Portuguese does this consistently as part of notating stress in certain monosyllables, whether or not there is an unstressed homophone (see examples above). Spanish also has many pairs of identically pronounced words distinguished by an acute accent on the stressed word: si \"if\" vs. s\u00ed \"yes\", mas \"but\" vs. m\u00e1s \"more\", mi \"my\" vs. m\u00ed \"me\", se \"oneself\" vs. s\u00e9 \"I know\", te \"you (object)\" vs. t\u00e9 \"tea\", que/quien/cuando/como \"that/who/when/how\" vs. qu\u00e9/qui\u00e9n/cu\u00e1ndo/c\u00f3mo \"what?/who?/when?/how?\", etc.  A similar strategy is common for monosyllables in writing Italian, but not necessarily determined by stress: stressed d\u00e0 \"it, s/he gives\" vs. unstressed da \"by, from\", but also t\u00e8 \"tea\" and te \"you\", both capable of bearing phrasal stress. Catalan has some pairs where both words are stressed, and one is distinguished by a vowel-quality diacritic, e.g. os \"bone\" vs. \u00f3s \"bear\".  When no vowel-quality needs distinguishing, French and Catalan use a grave accent: French ou \"or\" vs. o\u00f9 \"where\", French la \"the\" vs. \"l\u00e0 \"there\", Catalan ma \"my\" vs. m\u00e0 \"hand\".\n\nUpper and lower case\nMost languages are written with a mixture of two distinct but phonetically identical variants or \"cases\" of the alphabet: majuscule (\"uppercase\" or \"capital letters\"), derived from Roman stone-carved letter shapes, and minuscule (\"lowercase\"), derived from Carolingian writing and Medieval quill pen handwriting which were later adapted by printers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\n\nIn particular, all Romance languages capitalize (use uppercase for the first letter of) the following words: the first word of each complete sentence, most words in names of people, places, and organizations, and most words in titles of books. The Romance languages do not follow the German practice of capitalizing all nouns including common ones. Unlike English, the names of months, days of the weeks, and derivatives of proper nouns are usually not capitalized: thus, in Italian one capitalizes Francia (\"France\") and Francesco (\"Francis\"), but not francese (\"French\") or francescano (\"Franciscan\"). However, each language has some exceptions to this general rule.\n\n Degrees of lexical similarity between the Romance languages \nData from Ethnologue:Ethnologue, Languages of the World, 15th edition, SIL International, 2005.\n%FrenchCatalanItalianPortugueseRomanshRomanianSpanishSardinianFrench || || 85 || 89 || 75 || 78 || 75 || 75 || 80\n|-\n|Catalan  85   87  85  76  73  85  75Italian || 89 || 87 || || 80 || 78 || 77 || 82 || 85(a)\n|-\n|Portuguese  75  85  80   74  72  89  76Romansh || 78 || 76 || 78 || 74 || || 72 || 74 || 74\n|-\n|Romanian  75  73  77  72  72   71  74Spanish || 75 || 85 || 82 || 89 || 74 || 71 || || 76\n|-\n|Sardinian  80  75  85(a)  76  74  74  76 \n(a)The data concerning Sardinian may be somewhat ambiguous because there is no firmly established unitary standard.

These include the representation via von Neumann ordinals, commonly employed in axiomatic set theory, and a system based on equinumerosity that was proposed by Frege and by Russell.\n\n Definition as von Neumann ordinals \n\nIn Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, the natural numbers are defined recursively by letting  be the empty set and  for each n. In this way n = {0, 1, ..., n \u2212 1} for each natural number n. The first few numbers defined this way are:\n\nThe set N of natural numbers is defined in this system as the smallest set containing 0 and closed under the successor function S defined by S(n) = n \u222a {n}.  The structure \u27e8N, 0, S\u27e9 is a model of the Peano axioms.  The existence of the set N follows from the axiom of infinity in ZF set theory.\n\nThe set N and its elements, when constructed this way, are an initial part of the von Neumann ordinals.\n\n Frege and Russell \n\nGottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell each proposed defining a natural number n as the collection of all sets with n elements. More formally, a natural number is an equivalence class of finite sets under the equivalence relation of equinumerosity. This definition may appear circular, but it is not, because equinumerosity can be defined in alternate ways, for instance using the contextual definition sometimes known as Hume's principle, a definition which nowhere refers to number.\n\nThis definition goes through in type theory, and in set theories that grew out of type theory, such as New Foundations and related systems. But it does not work in the axiomatic set theory ZFC nor in certain related systems, because in such systems the equivalence classes under equinumerosity are proper classes rather than sets.\n\n Hatcher \n\nWilliam S. Hatcher (1982) derives Peano's axioms from several foundational systems, including ZFC and category theory, and from the system of Frege's Grundgesetze der Arithmetik using modern notation and natural deduction. The Russell paradox proved this system inconsistent, but George Boolos (1998) and David J. Anderson and Edward Zalta (2004) show how to repair it.\n\n See also \n\n Ackermann coding\n Foundations of mathematics\n New Foundations\n\n References \n\n Anderson, D.

{"title": "Set theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory", "text": "thumb|right|A Venn diagram illustrating the intersection of two sets.\nSet theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all mathematical objects.\n\nThe modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. After the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory, such as Russell's paradox, numerous axiom systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms, with or without the axiom of choice, are the best-known.\n\nSet theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for mathematics, particularly in the form of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. Beyond its foundational role, set theory is a branch of mathematics in its own right, with an active research community. Contemporary research into set theory includes a diverse collection of topics, ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals.\n\nHistory\nthumb|160px|Georg Cantor.\nMathematical topics typically emerge and evolve through interactions among many researchers. Set theory, however, was founded by a single paper in 1874 by Georg Cantor: \"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\".\n\nSince the 5th century BC, beginning with Greek mathematician Zeno of Elea in the West and early Indian mathematicians in the East, mathematicians had struggled with the concept of infinity. Especially notable is the work of Bernard Bolzano in the first half of the 19th century. Modern understanding of infinity began in 1870\u20131874 and was motivated by Cantor's work in real analysis.. An 1872 meeting between Cantor and Richard Dedekind influenced Cantor's thinking and culminated in Cantor's 1874 paper.\n\nCantor's work initially polarized the mathematicians of his day. While Karl Weierstrass and Dedekind supported Cantor, Leopold Kronecker, now seen as a founder of mathematical constructivism, did not. Cantorian set theory eventually became widespread, due to the utility of Cantorian concepts, such as one-to-one correspondence among sets, his proof that there are more real numbers than integers, and the \"infinity of infinities\" (\"Cantor's paradise\") resulting from the power set operation. This utility of set theory led to the article \"Mengenlehre\" contributed in 1898 by Arthur Schoenflies to Klein's encyclopedia.\n\nThe next wave of excitement in set theory came around 1900, when it was discovered that some interpretations of Cantorian set theory gave rise to several contradictions, called antinomies or paradoxes. Bertrand Russell and Ernst Zermelo independently found the simplest and best known paradox, now called Russell's paradox: consider \"the set of all sets that are not members of themselves\", which leads to a contradiction since it must be a member of itself and not a member of itself. In 1899 Cantor had himself posed the question \"What is the cardinal number of the set of all sets?\", and obtained a related paradox. Russell used his paradox as a theme in his 1903 review of continental mathematics in his The Principles of Mathematics.\n\nIn 1906 English readers gained the book Theory of Sets of Points by husband and wife William Henry Young and Grace Chisholm Young, published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nThe momentum of set theory was such that debate on the paradoxes did not lead to its abandonment. The work of Zermelo in 1908 and the work of Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem in 1922 resulted in the set of axioms ZFC, which became the most commonly used set of axioms for set theory. The work of analysts such as Henri Lebesgue demonstrated the great mathematical utility of set theory, which has since become woven into the fabric of modern mathematics. Set theory is commonly used as a foundational system, although in some areas\u2014such as algebraic geometry and algebraic topology\u2014category theory is thought to be a preferred foundation.\n\nBasic concepts and notation\n\nSet theory begins with a fundamental binary relation between an object  and a set . If  is a member (or element) of , the notation  is used. A set is described by listing elements separated by commas, or by a characterizing property of its elements, within braces { }. Since sets are objects, the membership relation can relate sets as well.\n\nA derived binary relation between two sets is the subset relation, also called set inclusion. If all the members of set  are also members of set , then  is a subset of , denoted . For example,  is a subset of , and so is  but  is not. As insinuated from this definition, a set is a subset of itself. For cases where this possibility is unsuitable or would make sense to be rejected, the term proper subset is defined.  is called a proper subset of  if and only if  is a subset of , but  is not equal to . Note also that 1, 2, and 3 are members (elements) of the set  but are not subsets of it; and in turn, the subsets, such as {1}, are not members of the set {1, 2, 3}.\n\nJust as arithmetic features binary operations on numbers, set theory features binary operations on sets. The:\nUnion of the sets  and , denoted , is the set of all objects that are a member of , or , or both. The union of  and  is the set .\nIntersection of the sets  and , denoted , is the set of all objects that are members of both  and . The intersection of  and  is the set .\nSet difference of  and , denoted , is the set of all members of  that are not members of . The set difference  is , while, conversely, the set difference  is . When  is a subset of , the set difference  is also called the complement of  in . In this case, if the choice of  is clear from the context, the notation  is sometimes used instead of , particularly if  is a universal set as in the study of Venn diagrams.\nSymmetric difference of sets  and , denoted  or , is the set of all objects that are a member of exactly one of  and  (elements which are in one of the sets, but not in both). For instance, for the sets  and , the symmetric difference set is . It is the set difference of the union and the intersection,  or .\nCartesian product of  and , denoted , is the set whose members are all possible ordered pairs  where  is a member of  and  is a member of . The cartesian product of \nPower set of a set  is the set whose members are all of the possible subsets of . For example, the power set of  is .\n\nSome basic sets of central importance are the empty set (the unique set containing no elements; occasionally called the null set though this name is ambiguous), the set of natural numbers, and the set of real numbers.\n\nSome ontology\n\nthumb|right|300px|An initial segment of the von Neumann hierarchy.\n\nA set is pure if all of its members are sets, all members of its members are sets, and so on. For example, the set  containing only the empty set is a nonempty pure set. In modern set theory, it is common to restrict attention to the von Neumann universe of pure sets, and many systems of axiomatic set theory are designed to axiomatize the pure sets only. There are many technical advantages to this restriction, and little generality is lost, because essentially all mathematical concepts can be modeled by pure sets. Sets in the von Neumann universe are organized into a cumulative hierarchy, based on how deeply their members, members of members, etc. are nested. Each set in this hierarchy is assigned (by transfinite recursion) an ordinal number \u03b1, known as its rank. The rank of a pure set X is defined to be the least upper bound of all successors of ranks of members of X. For example, the empty set is assigned rank 0, while the set  containing only the empty set is assigned rank 1. For each ordinal \u03b1, the set V\u03b1 is defined to consist of all pure sets with rank less than \u03b1. The entire von Neumann universe is denoted\u00a0V.\n\n Axiomatic set theory \nElementary set theory can be studied informally and intuitively, and so can be taught in primary schools using Venn diagrams. The intuitive approach tacitly assumes that a set may be formed from the class of all objects satisfying any particular defining condition. This assumption gives rise to paradoxes, the simplest and best known of which are Russell's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox. Axiomatic set theory was originally devised to rid set theory of such paradoxes.\n\nThe most widely studied systems of axiomatic set theory imply that all sets form a cumulative hierarchy. Such systems come in two flavors, those whose ontology consists of:\nSets alone. This includes the most common axiomatic set theory, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), which includes the axiom of choice. Fragments of ZFC include:\n Zermelo set theory, which replaces the axiom schema of replacement with that of separation;\n General set theory, a small fragment of Zermelo set theory sufficient for the Peano axioms and finite sets;\n Kripke\u2013Platek set theory, which omits the axioms of infinity, powerset, and choice, and weakens the axiom schemata of separation and replacement.\nSets and proper classes. These include Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory, which has the same strength as ZFC for theorems about sets alone, and Morse\u2013Kelley set theory and Tarski\u2013Grothendieck set theory, both of which are stronger than ZFC.\nThe above systems can be modified to allow urelements, objects that can be members of sets but that are not themselves sets and do not have any members.\n\nThe systems of New Foundations NFU (allowing urelements) and NF (lacking them) are not based on a cumulative hierarchy. NF and NFU include a \"set of everything, \" relative to which every set has a complement. In these systems urelements matter, because NF, but not NFU, produces sets for which the axiom of choice does not hold.\n\nSystems of constructive set theory, such as CST, CZF, and IZF, embed their set axioms in intuitionistic instead of classical logic. Yet other systems accept classical logic but feature a nonstandard membership relation. These include rough set theory and fuzzy set theory, in which the value of an atomic formula embodying the membership relation is not simply True or False. The Boolean-valued models of ZFC are a related subject.\n\nAn enrichment of ZFC called internal set theory was proposed by Edward Nelson in 1977.\n\nApplications\nMany mathematical concepts can be defined precisely using only set theoretic concepts. For example, mathematical structures as diverse as graphs, manifolds, rings, and vector spaces can all be defined as sets satisfying various (axiomatic) properties. Equivalence and order relations are ubiquitous in mathematics, and the theory of mathematical relations can be described in set theory.\n\nSet theory is also a promising foundational system for much of mathematics. Since the publication of the first volume of Principia Mathematica, it has been claimed that most or even all mathematical theorems can be derived using an aptly designed set of axioms for set theory, augmented with many definitions, using first or second-order logic. For example, properties of the natural and real numbers can be derived within set theory, as each number system can be identified with a set of equivalence classes under a suitable equivalence relation whose field is some infinite set.\n\nSet theory as a foundation for mathematical analysis, topology, abstract algebra, and discrete mathematics is likewise uncontroversial; mathematicians accept that (in principle) theorems in these areas can be derived from the relevant definitions and the axioms of set theory. Few full derivations of complex mathematical theorems from set theory have been formally verified, however, because such formal derivations are often much longer than the natural language proofs mathematicians commonly present. One verification project, Metamath, includes human-written, computer-verified derivations of more than 12,000 theorems starting from ZFC set theory, first-order logic and propositional logic.\n\nAreas of study\nSet theory is a major area of research in mathematics, with many interrelated subfields.\n\nCombinatorial set theory\n\nCombinatorial set theory concerns extensions of finite combinatorics to infinite sets. This includes the study of cardinal arithmetic and the study of extensions of Ramsey's theorem such as the Erd\u0151s\u2013Rado theorem.\n\nDescriptive set theory\n\nDescriptive set theory is the study of subsets of the real line and, more generally, subsets of Polish spaces. It begins with the study of pointclasses in the Borel hierarchy and extends to the study of more complex hierarchies such as the projective hierarchy and the Wadge hierarchy. Many properties of Borel sets can be established in ZFC, but proving these properties hold for more complicated sets requires additional axioms related to determinacy and large cardinals.\n\nThe field of effective descriptive set theory is between set theory and recursion theory. It includes the study of lightface pointclasses, and is closely related to hyperarithmetical theory. In many cases, results of classical descriptive set theory have effective versions; in some cases, new results are obtained by proving the effective version first and then extending (\"relativizing\") it to make it more broadly applicable.\n\nA recent area of research concerns Borel equivalence relations and more complicated definable equivalence relations. This has important applications to the study of invariants in many fields of mathematics.\n\nFuzzy set theory\n\nIn set theory as Cantor defined and Zermelo and Fraenkel axiomatized, an object is either a member of a set or not. In fuzzy set theory this condition was relaxed by Lotfi A. Zadeh so an object has a degree of membership in a set, a number between 0 and 1. For example, the degree of membership of a person in the set of \"tall people\" is more flexible than a simple yes or no answer and can be a real number such as 0.75.\n\nInner model theory\n\nAn inner model of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is a transitive class that includes all the ordinals and satisfies all the axioms of ZF. The canonical example is the constructible universe L developed by G\u00f6del.\nOne reason that the study of inner models is of interest is that it can be used to prove consistency results. For example, it can be shown that regardless of whether a model V of ZF satisfies the continuum hypothesis or the axiom of choice, the inner model L constructed inside the original model will satisfy both the generalized continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice. Thus the assumption that ZF is consistent (has at least one model) implies that ZF together with these two principles is consistent.\n\nThe study of inner models is common in the study of determinacy and large cardinals, especially when considering axioms such as the axiom of determinacy that contradict the axiom of choice. Even if a fixed model of set theory satisfies the axiom of choice, it is possible for an inner model to fail to satisfy the axiom of choice. For example, the existence of sufficiently large cardinals implies that there is an inner model satisfying the axiom of determinacy (and thus not satisfying the axiom of choice).\n\nLarge cardinals\n\nA large cardinal is a cardinal number with an extra property. Many such properties are studied, including inaccessible cardinals, measurable cardinals, and many more. These properties typically imply the cardinal number must be very large, with the existence of a cardinal with the specified property unprovable in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.\n\nDeterminacy\n\nDeterminacy refers to the fact that, under appropriate assumptions, certain two-player games of perfect information are determined from the start in the sense that one player must have a winning strategy. The existence of these strategies has important consequences in descriptive set theory, as the assumption that a broader class of games is determined often implies that a broader class of sets will have a topological property. The axiom of determinacy (AD) is an important object of study; although incompatible with the axiom of choice, AD implies that all subsets of the real line are well behaved (in particular, measurable and with the perfect set property). AD can be used to prove that the Wadge degrees have an elegant structure.\n\nForcing\n\nPaul Cohen invented the method of forcing while searching for a model of ZFC in which the continuum hypothesis fails, or a model of ZF in which the axiom of choice fails. Forcing adjoins to some given model of set theory additional sets in order to create a larger model with properties determined (i.e. \"forced\") by the construction and the original model. For example, Cohen's construction adjoins additional subsets of the natural numbers without changing any of the cardinal numbers of the original model. Forcing is also one of two methods for proving relative consistency by finitistic methods, the other method being Boolean-valued models.\n\nCardinal invariants\n\nA cardinal invariant is a property of the real line measured by a cardinal number. For example, a well-studied invariant is the smallest cardinality of a collection of meagre sets of reals whose union is the entire real line. These are invariants in the sense that any two isomorphic models of set theory must give the same cardinal for each invariant. Many cardinal invariants have been studied, and the relationships between them are often complex and related to axioms of set theory.\n\nSet-theoretic topology\n\nSet-theoretic topology studies questions of general topology that are set-theoretic in nature or that require advanced methods of set theory for their solution. Many of these theorems are independent of ZFC, requiring stronger axioms for their proof. A famous problem is the normal Moore space question, a question in general topology that was the subject of intense research. The answer to the normal Moore space question was eventually proved to be independent of ZFC.\n\nObjections to set theory as a foundation for mathematics\nFrom set theory's inception, some mathematicians have objected to it as a foundation for mathematics. The most common objection to set theory, one Kronecker voiced in set theory's earliest years, starts from the constructivist view that mathematics is loosely related to computation. If this view is granted, then the treatment of infinite sets, both in naive and in axiomatic set theory, introduces into mathematics methods and objects that are not computable even in principle. The feasibility of constructivism as a substitute foundation for mathematics was greatly increased by Errett Bishop's influential book Foundations of Constructive Analysis.\n\nA different objection put forth by Henri Poincar\u00e9 is that defining sets using the axiom schemas of specification and replacement, as well as the axiom of power set, introduces impredicativity, a type of circularity, into the definitions of mathematical objects. The scope of predicatively founded mathematics, while less than that of the commonly accepted Zermelo-Fraenkel theory, is much greater than that of constructive mathematics, to the point that Solomon Feferman has said that \"all of scientifically applicable analysis can be developed [using predicative methods]\".\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein condemned set theory. He wrote that \"set theory is wrong\", since it builds on the \"nonsense\" of fictitious symbolism, has \"pernicious idioms\", and that it is nonsensical to talk about \"all numbers\". Wittgenstein's views about the foundations of mathematics were later criticised by Georg Kreisel and Paul Bernays, and investigated by Crispin Wright, among others.\n\nCategory theorists have proposed topos theory as an alternative to traditional axiomatic set theory. Topos theory can interpret various alternatives to that theory, such as constructivism, finite set theory, and computable set theory. Topoi also give a natural setting for forcing and discussions of the independence of choice from ZF, as well as providing the framework for pointless topology and Stone spaces.\n\nAn active area of research is the univalent foundations and related to it homotopy type theory. Within homotopy type theory, a set may be regarded as a homotopy 0-type, with universal properties of sets arising from the inductive and recursive properties of higher inductive types. Principles such as the axiom of choice and the law of the excluded middle can be formulated in a manner corresponding to the classical formulation in set theory or perhaps in a spectrum of distinct ways unique to type theory. Some of these principles may be proven to be a consequence of other principles. The variety of formulations of these axiomatic principles allows for a detailed analysis of the formulations required in order to derive various mathematical results.Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics.

{"title": "The Principles of Mathematics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Mathematics", "text": "The Principles of Mathematics (PoM) is a 1903 book by Bertrand Russell, in which the author presented his famous paradox and argued his thesis that mathematics and logic are identical.\n \nThe book presents a view of the foundations of mathematics and has become a classic reference. It reported on developments by Giuseppe Peano, Mario Pieri, Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor, and others.\n\nIn 1905 Louis Couturat published a partial French translationLouis Couturat (1905) Les Principes des math\u00e9matiques: avec un appendice sur la philosophie des math\u00e9matiques de Kant. Republished 1965, Georg Olms that expanded the book's readership. In 1937 Russell prepared a new introduction saying, \"Such interest as the book now possesses is historical, and consists in the fact that it represents a certain stage in the development of its subject.\" Further editions were printed in 1938, 1951, 1996, and 2009.\n\nContents\nThe Principles of Mathematics consists of 59 chapters divided into seven parts: indefinables in mathematics, number, quantity, order, infinity and continuity, space, matter and motion.\n\nIn chapter one, \"Definition of Pure Mathematics\", Russell asserts that : \nThe fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic Logic is one of the greatest discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been established, the remainder of the principles of mathematics consists in the analysis of Symbolic Logic itself.Bertrand Russell, Principles of Mathematics (1903), p.5\nThere is an anticipation of relativity physics in the final part as the last three chapters consider Newton's laws of motion, absolute and relative motion, and Hertz's dynamics. However, Russell rejects what he calls \"the relational theory\", and says on page 489 : \nFor us, since absolute space and time have been admitted, there is no need to avoid absolute motion, and indeed no possibility of doing so.\nIn his review, G. H. Hardy says \"Mr. Russell is a firm believer in absolute position in space and time, a view as much out of fashion nowadays that Chapter [58: Absolute and Relative Motion] will be read with peculiar interest.\"\n\nEarly reviews\nReviews were prepared by G. E. Moore and Charles Sanders Peirce, but Moore's was never published and that of Peirce was brief and somewhat dismissive. He indicated that he thought it unoriginal, saying that the book \"can hardly be called literature\" and \"Whoever wishes a convenient introduction to the remarkable researches into the logic of mathematics that have been made during the last sixty years [...] will do well to take up this book.\"\n\nG. H. Hardy wrote a favorable reviewG. H. Hardy (18 September 1903) \"The Philosophy of Mathematics\", Times Literary Supplement #88 expecting the book to appeal more to philosophers than mathematicians. But he says : \n[I]n spite of its five hundred pages the book is much too short. Many chapters dealing with important questions are compressed into five or six pages, and in some places, especially in the most avowedly controversial parts, the argument is almost too condensed to follow. And the philosopher who attempts to read the book will be especially puzzled by the constant presupposition of a whole philosophical system utterly unlike any of those usually accepted.\nIn 1904 another review appeared in Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society (11(2):74\u201393) written by Edwin Bidwell Wilson. He says \"The delicacy of the question is such that even the greatest mathematicians and philosophers of to-day have made what seem to be substantial slips of judgement and have shown on occasions an astounding ignorance of the essence of the problem which they were discussing. ... all too frequently it has been the result of a wholly unpardonable disregard of the work already accomplished by others.\" Wilson recounts the developments of Peano that Russell reports, and takes the occasion to correct Henri Poincar\u00e9 who had ascribed them to David Hilbert. In praise of Russell, Wilson says \"Surely the present work is a monument to patience, perseverance, and thoroughness.\" (page 88)\n\nSecond edition\nIn 1938 the book was re-issued with a new preface by Russell. This preface was interpreted as a retreat from the realism of the first edition and a turn toward nominalist philosophy of symbolic logic. James Feibleman, an admirer of the book, thought Russell\u2019s new preface went too far into nominalism so he wrote a rebuttal to this introduction.James Feibleman (1944) Reply to the Introduction of the Second Edition, pages 157 to 174 of The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell, P.A. Schilpp, editor, link from HathiTrust Feibleman says, \"It is the first comprehensive treatise on symbolic logic to be written in English; and it gives to that system of logic a realistic interpretation.\"\n\nLater reviews\nIn 1959 Russell wrote My Philosophical Development, in which he recalled the impetus to write the Principles:\nIt was at the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in the year 1900 that I became aware of the importance of logical reform for the philosophy of mathematics. ... I was impressed by the fact that, in every discussion, [Peano] showed more precision and more logical rigour than was shown by anybody else. ... It was [Peano's works] that gave the impetus to my own views on the principles of mathematics.Russell, My Philosophical Development, p. 65.\nRecalling the book after his later work, he provides this evaluation:\nThe Principles of Mathematics, which I finished on 23 May 1902, turned out to be a crude and rather immature draft of the subsequent work [Principia Mathematica], from which, however, it differed in containing controversy with other philosophies of mathematics.Russell, My Philosophical Development, p. 74.\n\nSuch self-deprecation from the author after half a century of philosophical growth is understandable. On the other hand, Jules Vuillemin wrote in 1968: \nThe Principles inaugurated contemporary philosophy. Other works have won and lost the title. Such is not the case with this one. It is serious, and its wealth perseveres. Furthermore, in relation to it, in a deliberate fashion or not, it locates itself again today in the eyes of all those that believe that contemporary science has modified our representation of the universe and through this representation, our relation to ourselves and to others.Jules Vuillemin (1968) Le\u00e7ons sur la primi\u00e8re philosophie de Russell, page 333, Paris: Colin\n\nWhen W. V. O. Quine penned his autobiography, he wrote:W. V. O. Quine (1985) The Time of My Life, page 59, MIT Press \nPeano's symbolic notation took Russell by storm in 1900, but Russell\u2019s Principles was still in unrelieved prose. I was inspired by its profundity [in 1928] and baffled by its frequent opacity. In part it was rough going because of the cumbersomeness of ordinary language as compared with the suppleness of a notation especially devised for these intricate themes. Rereading it years later, I discovered that it had been rough going also because matters were unclear in Russell's own mind in those pioneer days.\n\nThe Principles was an early expression of analytic philosophy and thus has come under close examination.Peter Hylton (1990) Russell, Idealism, and the Emergence of Analytic Philosophy, chapter 5: Russell\u2019s Principles of Mathematics, pp 167 to 236, Clarendon Press,  Peter Hylton wrote, \"The book has an air of excitement and novelty to it ... The salient characteristic of Principles is ... the way in which the technical work is integrated into metaphysical argument.\"\n\nIvor Grattan-Guinness made an in-depth study of Principles. First he published Dear Russell \u2013 Dear Jourdain (1977)Ivor Grattan-Guinness (1977) Dear Russell \u2013 Dear Jourdain: a commentary on Russell\u2019s logic, based on his correspondence with Philip Jourdain, Duckworth Overlook  which included correspondence with Philip Jourdain who promulgated some of the book\u2019s ideas. Then in 2000 Grattan-Guinness published The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870 \u2013 1940 which considered the author\u2019s circumstances, the book\u2019s composition and its shortcomings.Ivor Grattan-Guinness (2000) The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870\u20131940: Logics, Set Theories, and the Foundations of Mathematics from Cantor through Russell to G\u00f6del, Princeton University Press .

{"title": "True arithmetic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_arithmetic", "text": "In mathematical logic, true arithmetic is the set of all true statements about the arithmetic of natural numbers (Boolos, Burgess, and Jeffrey 2002:295). This is the theory associated with the standard model of the Peano axioms in the language of the first-order Peano axioms.\nTrue arithmetic is occasionally called Skolem arithmetic, though this term usually refers to the different theory of natural numbers with multiplication.\n\n Definition \n\nThe signature of Peano arithmetic includes the addition, multiplication, and successor function symbols, the equality and less-than relation symbols, and a constant symbol for 0. The (well-formed) formulas of the language of first-order arithmetic are built up from these symbols together with the logical symbols in the usual manner of first-order logic.\n\nThe structure  is defined to be a model of Peano arithmetic as follows.\n The domain of discourse is the set  of natural numbers,\n The symbol 0 is interpreted as the number 0,\n The function symbols are interpreted as the usual arithmetical operations on ,\n The equality and less-than relation symbols are interpreted as the usual equality and order relation on .\nThis structure is known as the standard model or intended interpretation of first-order arithmetic.\n\nA sentence in the language of first-order arithmetic is said to be true in  if it is true in the structure just defined. The notation  is used to indicate that the sentence  is true in \n\nTrue arithmetic is defined to be the set of all sentences in the language of first-order arithmetic that are true in , written . This set is, equivalently, the (complete) theory of the structure  (see theories associated with a structure).\n\n Arithmetic undefinability \n\nThe central result on true arithmetic is the undefinability theorem of Alfred Tarski (1936). It states that \nthe set  is not arithmetically definable. This means that there is no formula  in the language of first-order arithmetic such that, for every sentence \u03b8 in this language, \n if and only if \nHere  is the numeral of the canonical G\u00f6del number of the sentence \u03b8.\n\nPost's theorem is a sharper version of the undefinability theorem that shows a relationship between the definability of  and the Turing degrees, using the arithmetical hierarchy. For each natural number n, let   be the subset of  consisting of only sentences that are  or lower in the arithmetical hierarchy. Post's theorem shows that, for each n,  is arithmetically definable, but only by a formula of complexity higher than . Thus no single formula can define , because \n\nbut no single formula can define  for arbitrarily large n.\n\n Computability properties \n\nAs discussed above,  is not arithmetically definable, by Tarski's theorem. A corollary of Post's theorem establishes that the Turing degree of  is 0(\u03c9), and so   is not decidable nor recursively enumerable.\n\n is closely related to the theory  of the recursively enumerable Turing degrees, in the signature of partial orders (Shore 1999:184). In particular, there are computable functions S and T such that:\n For each sentence \u03c6 in the signature of first order arithmetic, \u03c6 is in   if and only if S(\u03c6) is in .\n For each sentence \u03c8 in the signature of partial orders, \u03c8 is in   if and only if T(\u03c8) is in  .\n\n Model-theoretic properties \n\nTrue arithmetic is an unstable theory, and so has  models for each uncountable cardinal .  As there are continuum many types over the empty set, true arithmetic also has   countable models.  Since the theory is complete, all of its models are elementarily equivalent.\n\n True theory of second-order arithmetic \n\nThe true theory of second-order arithmetic consists of all the sentences in the language of second-order arithmetic that are satisfied by the standard model of second-order arithmetic, whose first-order part is the structure  and whose second-order part consists of every subset of .\n\nThe true theory of first-order arithmetic, , is a subset of the true theory of second order arithmetic, and  is definable in second-order arithmetic.  However, the generalization of Post's theorem to the analytical hierarchy shows that the true theory of second-order arithmetic is not definable by any single formula in second-order arithmetic.\n\nSimpson (1977) has shown that the true theory of second-order arithmetic is computably interpretable with the theory of the partial order of all Turing degrees, in the signature of partial orders, and vice versa.\n\n References \n .\n .\n .\n \n Tarski, Alfred (1936), \"Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen\".

{"title": "Typographical Number Theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_Number_Theory", "text": "Typographical Number Theory (TNT) is a formal axiomatic system describing the natural numbers that appears in Douglas Hofstadter's book G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.  It is an implementation of Peano arithmetic that Hofstadter uses to help explain G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems.\n\nLike any system implementing the Peano axioms, TNT is capable of referring to itself (it is self-referential).\n\n Numerals \n\nTNT does not use a distinct symbol for each natural number. Instead it makes use of a simple, uniform way of giving a compound symbol to each natural number:\n\n{| \n| zero\n| align=right | 0\n|-\n| one\n| align=right | S0\n|-\n| two\n| align=right | SS0\n|-\n| three\n| align=right | SSS0\n|-\n| four\n| align=right | SSSS0\n|-\n| five\n| align=right | SSSSS0\n|}\n\nThe symbol S can be interpreted as \"the successor of\", or \"the number after\". Since this is, however, a number theory, such interpretations are useful, but not strict. It cannot be said that because four is the successor of three that four is SSSS0, but rather that since three is the successor of two, which is the successor of one, which is the successor of zero, which has been described as 0, four can be \"proved\" to be SSSS0. TNT is designed such that everything must be proven before it can be said to be true.\n\n Variables \nIn order to refer to unspecified terms, TNT makes use of five variables. These are\n a, b, c, d, e.\nMore variables can be constructed by adding the prime symbol after them; for example,\na\u2032, b\u2032, c\u2032, a\u2033, a\u2034 are all variables.\n\nIn the more rigid version of TNT, known as \"austere\" TNT, only\na\u2032, a\u2033, a\u2034 etc. are used.\n\n Operators \n Addition and multiplication of numerals \nIn Typographical Number Theory, the usual symbols of \"+\" for additions, and \"\u00b7\" for multiplications are used. Thus to write \"b plus c\" is to write\n\n (b\u00a0+\u00a0c)\n\nand \"a times d\" is written as\n\n(a\u00b7d)\n\nThe parentheses are required. Any laxness would violate TNT's formation system (although it is trivially proved this formalism is unnecessary for operations which are both commutative and associative). Also only two terms can be operated on at once. Therefore, to write \"a plus b plus c\" is to write either\n\n((a\u00a0+\u00a0b)\u00a0+\u00a0c)\n\nor\n\n(a\u00a0+\u00a0(b\u00a0+\u00a0c))\n\n Equivalency \nThe \"Equals\" operator is used to denote equivalence. It is defined by the symbol \"=\", and takes roughly the same meaning as it usually does in mathematics. For instance,\n(SSS0\u00a0+\u00a0SSS0)\u00a0=\u00a0SSSSSS0\nis a theorem statement in TNT, with the interpretation \"3 plus 3 equals\u00a06\".\n\n Negation \nIn Typographical Number Theory, negation, i.e. the turning of a statement to its opposite, is denoted by the \"~\" or negation operator. For instance,\n\n~(SSS0\u00a0+\u00a0SSS0\u00a0=\u00a0SSSSSSS0)\n\nis a theorem in TNT, interpreted as \"3 plus 3 is not equal to\u00a07\".\n\nBy negation, this means negation in Boolean logic (logical negation), rather than simply being the opposite.  For example, if I were to say \"I am eating a grapefruit\", the opposite is \"I am not eating a grapefruit\", rather than \"I am eating something other than a grapefruit\". Similarly \"The Television is on\" is negated to \"The Television is not on\", rather than \"The Television is off\". This is a subtle difference, but an important one.\n\n Compounds \nIf x and y are well-formed formulas, and provided that no variable which is free in one is quantified in the other, then the following are all well-formed formulas\n\n < x\u2227y >, <x\u2228y>, <x\u2283y>  \n\nExamples:\n\n<0=0\u2227~0=0>\n<b=b\u2228~\u2203c:c=b>\n<S0=0\u2283\u2200c:~\u2203b:(b+b)=c>\n\nThe quantification status of a variable doesn't change here.\n\n Quantifiers \nThere are two quantifiers used: \u2200 and \u2203.\n\nNote that unlike most other logical systems where qualifiers over sets require a mention of the element's existence in the set, this is not required in TNT because all numbers and terms are strictly natural numbers or logical boolean statements. It is therefore equivalent to say \u2200a:(a\u00a0\u2208\u00a0N):\u2200b:(b\u00a0\u2208\u00a0N):\u00a0(a\u00a0+\u00a0b)\u00a0=\u00a0(b\u00a0+\u00a0a)\u00a0 and \u2200a:\u2200b:(a\u00a0+\u00a0b)\u00a0=\u00a0(b\u00a0+\u00a0a)\n\n\u2203 means \"There exists\"\n\u2200 means \"For every\" or \"For all\"\nThe symbol : is used to separate a quantifier from other quantifiers or from the rest of the formula. It is commonly read \"such that\"\n\nFor example:\n\n\u2200a:\u2200b:(a\u00a0+\u00a0b)\u00a0=\u00a0(b\u00a0+\u00a0a)\n(\"For every number a and every number b, a plus b equals b plus a\", or more figuratively, \"Addition is commutative.\")\n\n~\u2203c:Sc\u00a0=\u00a00\n\n(\"There does not exist a number c such that c plus one equals zero\", or more figuratively, \"Zero is not the successor of any (natural) number.\")\n\n Atoms and propositional statements \n\nAll the symbols of propositional calculus apart from the Atom symbols are used in Typographical Number Theory, and they retain their interpretations.\n\nAtoms are here defined as strings which amount to statements of equality, such as\n\n2 plus 3 equals five:\n(SS0\u00a0+\u00a0SSS0)\u00a0=\u00a0SSSSS0\n2 plus 2 is equal to 4:\n(SS0\u00a0+\u00a0SS0)\u00a0=\u00a0SSSS0\n\nReferences\n .\n\nCategory:Formal theories of arithmetic"}
{"title": "Undecidable problem", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem", "text": "In computability theory and computational complexity theory, an undecidable problem is a decision problem for which it is proved to be impossible to construct an algorithm that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer. The halting problem is an example: it can be proven that there is no algorithm that correctly determines whether arbitrary programs eventually halt when run.\n\n Background \nA decision problem is any arbitrary yes-or-no question on an infinite set of inputs.  Because of this, it is traditional to define the decision problem equivalently as the set of inputs for which the problem returns yes. These inputs can be natural numbers, but also other values of some other kind, such as strings of a formal language. Using some encoding, such as a G\u00f6del numbering, the strings can be encoded as natural numbers.  Thus, a decision problem informally phrased in terms of a formal language is also equivalent to a set of natural numbers.  To keep the formal definition simple, it is phrased in terms of subsets of the natural numbers.\n\nFormally, a decision problem is a subset of the natural numbers. The corresponding informal problem is that of deciding whether a given number is in the set. A decision problem A is called decidable or effectively solvable if A is a recursive set. A problem is called partially decidable, semi-decidable, solvable, or provable if A is a recursively enumerable set. This means that there exists an algorithm that halts eventually when the answer is yes but may run for ever if the answer is no. Partially decidable problems and any other problems that are not decidable are called undecidable.\n\nExample: the halting problem in computability theory\nIn computability theory, the halting problem is a decision problem which can be stated as follows:\n\nGiven the description of an arbitrary program and a finite input, decide whether the program finishes running or will run forever.\n\nAlan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm running on a Turing machine that solves the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs necessarily cannot exist. Hence, the halting problem is undecidable for Turing machines.\n\nRelationship with G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem\nThe concepts raised by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems are very similar to those raised by the halting problem, and the proofs are quite similar. In fact, a weaker form of the First Incompleteness Theorem is an easy consequence of the undecidability of the halting problem. This weaker form differs from the standard statement of the incompleteness theorem by asserting that a complete, consistent and sound axiomatization of all statements about natural numbers is unachievable. The \"sound\" part is the weakening: it means that we require the axiomatic system in question to prove only true statements about natural numbers. It is important to observe that the statement of the standard form of G\u00f6del's First Incompleteness Theorem is completely unconcerned with the question of truth, but only concerns the issue of whether it can be proven.\n\nThe weaker form of the theorem can be proved from the undecidability of the halting problem as follows. Assume that we have a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers. Then we can build an algorithm that enumerates all these statements. This means that there is an algorithm N(n) that, given a natural number n, computes a true first-order logic statement about natural numbers such that, for all the true statements, there is at least one n such that N(n) yields that statement. Now suppose we want to decide if the algorithm with representation a halts on input i.  We know that this statement can be expressed with a first-order logic statement, say H(a, i).  Since the axiomatization is complete it follows that either there is an n such that N(n) =  H(a, i) or there is an n' such that N(n') = \u00ac H(a, i).  So if we iterate over all n until we either find H(a, i) or its negation, we will always halt. This means that this gives us an algorithm to decide the halting problem. Since we know that there cannot be such an algorithm, it follows that the assumption that there is a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers must be false.\n\nExamples of undecidable problems\n\nUndecidable problems can be related to different topics, such as logic, abstract machines or topology. Note that since there are uncountably many undecidable problems, any list, even one of infinite length, is necessarily incomplete.\n\nExamples of undecidable statements\n\nThere are two distinct senses of the word \"undecidable\" in contemporary use. The first of these is the sense used in relation to G\u00f6del's theorems, that of a statement being neither provable nor refutable in a specified deductive system. The second sense is used in relation to computability theory and applies not to statements but to decision problems, which are countably infinite sets of questions each requiring a yes or no answer. Such a problem is said to be undecidable if there is no computable function that correctly answers every question in the problem set.  The connection between these two is that if a decision problem is undecidable (in the recursion theoretical sense) then there is no consistent, effective formal system which proves for every question A in the problem either \"the answer to A is yes\" or \"the answer to A is no\".\n\nBecause of the two meanings of the word undecidable, the term independent is sometimes used instead of undecidable for the \"neither provable nor refutable\" sense. The usage of \"independent\" is also ambiguous, however. It can mean just \"not provable\", leaving open whether an independent statement might be refuted.\n\nUndecidability of a statement in a particular deductive system does not, in and of itself, address the question of whether the truth value of the statement is well-defined, or whether it can be determined by other means. Undecidability only implies that the particular deductive system being considered does not prove the truth or falsity of the statement. Whether there exist so-called \"absolutely undecidable\" statements, whose truth value can never be known or is ill-specified, is a controversial point among various philosophical schools.\n\nOne of the first problems suspected to be undecidable, in the second sense of the term, was the word problem for groups, first posed by Max Dehn in 1911, which asks if there is a finitely presented group for which no algorithm exists to determine whether two words are equivalent.  This was shown to be the case in 1952.\n\nThe combined work of G\u00f6del and Paul Cohen has given two concrete examples of undecidable statements (in the first sense of the term): The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor refuted in ZFC (the standard axiomatization of set theory), and the axiom of choice can neither be proved nor refuted in ZF (which is all the ZFC axioms except the axiom of choice).  These results do not require the incompleteness theorem.   G\u00f6del proved in 1940 that neither of these statements could be disproved in ZF or ZFC set theory. In the 1960s, Cohen proved that neither is provable from ZF, and the continuum hypothesis cannot be proven from ZFC.\n\nIn 1970, Russian mathematician Yuri Matiyasevich showed that Hilbert's Tenth Problem, posed in 1900 as a challenge to the next century of mathematicians, cannot be solved.    Hilbert's challenge sought an algorithm which finds all solutions of a Diophantine equation.  A Diophantine equation is a more general case of Fermat's Last Theorem; we seek the integer roots of a polynomial in any number of variables with integer coefficients.  Since we have only one equation but n variables, infinitely many solutions exist (and are easy to find) in the complex plane; however, the problem becomes impossible if solutions are constrained to integer values only.  Matiyasevich showed this problem to be unsolvable by mapping a Diophantine equation to a recursively enumerable set and invoking G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem.\n\nIn 1936, Alan Turing proved that the halting problem\u2014the question of whether or not a Turing machine halts on a given program\u2014is undecidable, in the second sense of the term. This result was later generalized by Rice's theorem.\n\nIn 1973, Saharon Shelah showed the Whitehead problem in group theory is undecidable, in the first sense of the term, in standard set theory.\n\nIn 1977, Paris and Harrington proved that the Paris-Harrington principle, a version of the Ramsey theorem, is undecidable in the axiomatization of arithmetic given by the Peano axioms but can be proven to be true in the larger system of second-order arithmetic.\n\nKruskal's tree theorem, which has applications in computer science, is also undecidable from the Peano axioms but provable in set theory. In fact Kruskal's tree theorem (or its finite form) is undecidable in a much stronger system codifying the principles acceptable on basis of a philosophy of mathematics called predicativism.\n\nGoodstein's theorem is a statement about the Ramsey theory of the natural numbers that Kirby and Paris showed is undecidable in Peano arithmetic.\n\nGregory Chaitin produced undecidable statements in algorithmic information theory and proved another incompleteness theorem in that setting. Chaitin's theorem states that for any theory that can represent enough arithmetic, there is an upper bound c such that no specific number can be proven in that theory to have Kolmogorov complexity greater than c. While G\u00f6del's theorem is related to the liar paradox, Chaitin's result is related to Berry's paradox.\n\nIn 2007, researchers Kurtz and Simon, building on earlier work by J.H. Conway in the 1970s, proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable.Kurtz, Stuart A.; Simon, Janos, \"The Undecidability of the. Generalized Collatz Problem\", in Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Models of Computation, TAMC 2007, held in Shanghai, China in May 2007. . \n\nSee also\n Decidability (logic)\n Entscheidungsproblem\n Proof of impossibility\n Wicked problem\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Logic in computer science\nCategory:Computability theory\n "}
{"title": "Vector space", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space", "text": "200px|thumb|right|Vector addition and scalar multiplication: a vector  (blue) is added to another vector  (red, upper illustration). Below, w is stretched by a factor of 2, yielding the sum .\n\nA vector space (also called a linear space) is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied (\"scaled\") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.\n\nEuclidean vectors are an example of a vector space.  They represent physical quantities such as forces: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force vector. In the same vein, but in a more geometric sense, vectors representing displacements in the plane or in three-dimensional space also form vector spaces. Vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow-like objects as they appear in the mentioned examples: vectors are regarded as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties, which in some cases can be visualized as arrows.\n\nVector spaces are the subject of linear algebra and are well characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a norm or inner product are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.\n\nHistorically, the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far as the 17th century's analytic geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.\n\nToday, vector spaces are applied throughout mathematics, science and engineering. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with systems of linear equations. They offer a framework for Fourier expansion, which is employed in image compression routines, and they provide an environment that can be used for solution techniques for partial differential equations. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as tensors. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra.\n\n Introduction and definition \nThe concept of vector space will first be explained by describing two particular examples:\n\nFirst example: arrows in the plane\nThe first example of a vector space consists of arrows in a fixed plane, starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe forces or velocities. Given any two such arrows,  and , the parallelogram spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the sum of the two arrows and is denoted . In the special case of two arrows on the same line, their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive real number , the arrow that has the same direction as , but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by , is called multiplication of  by . It is denoted . When  is negative,  is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction, instead.\n\nThe following shows a few examples: if , the resulting vector  has the same direction as , but is stretched to the double length of  (right image below). Equivalently,  is the sum . Moreover,  has the opposite direction and the same length as  (blue vector pointing down in the right image).\n\n180px|Vector addition: the sum  (black) of the vectors  (blue) and  (red) is shown.230px|Scalar multiplication: the multiples  and  are shown.\n\nSecond example: ordered pairs of numbers\nA second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers  and . (The order of the components  and  is significant, so such a pair is also called an ordered pair.) Such a pair is written as . The sum of two such pairs and multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:\n +  \nand \n.\n\nThe first example above reduces to this one if the arrows are represented by the pair of Cartesian coordinates of their end points.\n\nDefinition\nIn this article, vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars.It is also common, especially in physics, to denote vectors with an arrow on top: .\n\nA vector space over a field  is a set\u00a0 together with two operations that satisfy the eight axioms listed below.\n\n The first operation, called vector addition or simply addition , takes any two vectors\u00a0 and  and assigns to them a third vector which is commonly written as , and called the sum of these two vectors. (Note that the resultant vector is also an element of the set  ). \n The second operation, called scalar multiplication \uff0c takes any scalar\u00a0 and any vector\u00a0 and gives another vector\u00a0. (Similarly, the vector  is an element of the set ).\n\nElements of  are commonly called vectors. Elements of\u00a0 are commonly called scalars.\n\nIn the two examples above, the field is the field of the real numbers and the set of the vectors consists of the planar arrows with fixed starting point and of pairs of real numbers, respectively.\n\nTo qualify as a vector space, the set\u00a0 and the operations of addition and multiplication must adhere to a number of requirements called axioms. In the list below, let ,  and  be arbitrary vectors in , and  and  scalars in .\n\n Axiom  Meaning Associativity of addition   Commutativity of addition   Identity element of addition  There exists an element , called the zero vector, such that  for all . Inverse elements of addition  For every , there exists an element , called the additive inverse of , such that . Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication   This axiom and the next refer to two different operations: scalar multiplication: ; and field multiplication: . They do not assert the associativity of either operation. More formally, scalar multiplication is a monoid action of the multiplicative monoid of the field  on the vector space . Identity element of scalar multiplication   , where  denotes the multiplicative identity in . Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition\u2003\u2003  Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition  \n\nThese axioms generalize properties of the vectors introduced in the above examples. Indeed, the result of addition of two ordered pairs (as in the second example above) does not depend on the order of the summands:\n.\n\nLikewise, in the geometric example of vectors as arrows,  since the parallelogram defining the sum of the vectors is independent of the order of the vectors. All other axioms can be checked in a similar manner in both examples. Thus, by disregarding the concrete nature of the particular type of vectors, the definition incorporates these two and many more examples in one notion of vector space.\n\nSubtraction of two vectors and division by a (non-zero) scalar can be defined as\n .\n\nWhen the scalar field  is the real numbers , the vector space is called a real vector space. When the scalar field is the complex numbers , the vector space is called a complex vector space. These two cases are the ones used most often in engineering. The general definition of a vector space allows scalars to be elements of any fixed field . The notion is then known as an -vector spaces or a vector space over . A field is, essentially, a set of numbers possessing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.Some authors (such as ) restrict attention to the fields  or , but most of the theory is unchanged for an arbitrary field. For example, rational numbers form a field.\n\nIn contrast to the intuition stemming from vectors in the plane and higher-dimensional cases, there is, in general vector spaces, no notion of nearness, angles or distances. To deal with such matters, particular types of vector spaces are introduced; see below.\n\nAlternative formulations and elementary consequences\nVector addition and scalar multiplication are operations, satisfying the closure property:   and  are in  for all  in , and ,  in . Some older sources mention these properties as separate axioms.\n\nIn the parlance of abstract algebra, the first four axioms are equivalent to requiring the set of vectors to be an abelian group under addition. The remaining axioms give this group an -module structure. In other words, there is a ring homomorphism  from the field  into the endomorphism ring of the group of vectors. Then scalar multiplication  is defined as .. Bourbaki calls the group homomorphisms  homotheties.\n\nThere are a number of direct consequences of the vector space axioms. Some of them derive from elementary group theory, applied to the additive group of vectors: for example, the zero vector  of  and the additive inverse  of any vector  are unique. Further properties follow by employing also the distributive law for the scalar multiplication, for example  equals  if and only if  equals  or  equals .\n\nHistory\nVector spaces stem from affine geometry via the introduction of coordinates in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, Descartes and Fermat founded analytic geometry by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve. In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, Bolzano introduced certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors. His work was then used in the conception of barycentric coordinates by M\u00f6bius in 1827. In 1828 C. V. Mourey suggested the existence of an algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.\n\nThe definition of vectors was founded on Bellavitis' notion of the bipoint, an oriented segment of which one end is the origin and the other a target, then further elaborated with the presentation of complex numbers by Argand and Hamilton and the introduction of quaternions and biquaternions by the latter. They are elements in , , and ; their treatment as linear combinations can be traced back to Laguerre in 1867, who also defined systems of linear equations.\n\nIn 1857, Cayley introduced matrix notation, which allows for a harmonization and simplification of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by M\u00f6bius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations. In his work, the concepts of linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work extended a vector space of n dimensions to one of 2n dimensions by consideration of 2-vectors  and 3-vectors  called multivectors. This extension, called multilinear algebra, is governed by the rules of exterior algebra. Peano was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.\n\nAn important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces.,  Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.\n\n Examples \n\nCoordinate spaces\n\nThe simplest example of a vector space over a field  is the field itself, equipped with its standard addition and multiplication. More generally, all -tuples (sequences of length ) \n\nof elements of  form a vector space that is  usually denoted  and called a coordinate space. \nThe case  is the above-mentioned simplest example, in which the field  is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case  and  was discussed in the introduction above.\n\nComplex numbers and other field extensions\nThe set of complex numbers , i.e., numbers that can be written in the form  for real numbers  and  where  is the imaginary unit, form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication:  and  for real numbers , , ,  and .  The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic.\n\nIn fact, the example of complex numbers is essentially the same (i.e., it is isomorphic) to the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number  as representing the ordered pair  in the complex plane then we see that the rules for sum and scalar product correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.\n\nMore generally, field extensions provide another class of examples of vector spaces, particularly in algebra and algebraic number theory: a field  containing a smaller field  is an -vector space, by the given multiplication and addition operations of . For example, the complex numbers are a vector space over , and the field extension  is a vector space over .  \n\nFunction spaces\n\nthumb|Addition of functions: The sum of the sine and the exponential function is  with \n\nFunctions from any fixed set  to a field  also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions  and  is the function  given by\n,\nand similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when  is the real line or an interval, or other subsets of . Many notions in topology and analysis, such as continuity, integrability or differentiability are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property.e.g.   Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces. They are studied in greater detail using the methods of functional analysis, see below. Algebraic constraints also yield vector spaces: the vector space  is given by polynomial functions:\n, where the coefficients  are in .\n\nLinear equations\n\nSystems of homogeneous linear equations are closely tied to vector spaces. For example, the solutions of \n{|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nare given by triples with arbitrary , , and . They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. Matrices can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely\n,\nwhere   is the matrix containing the coefficients of the given equations,  is the vector ,  denotes the matrix product, and  is the zero vector. In a similar vein, the solutions of homogeneous linear differential equations form vector spaces. For example,\n\nyields , where  and  are arbitrary constants, and  is the natural exponential function.\n\n Basis and dimension \n\nA vector  in  (blue) expressed in terms of different bases: using the standard basis of  (black), and using a different, non-orthogonal basis:  (red).|thumb|200px\nBases allow one to represent vectors by a sequence of scalars called coordinates or components. A basis is a (finite or infinite) set  of vectors , for convenience often indexed by some index set , that spans the whole space and is linearly independent. \"Spanning the whole space\" means that any vector  can be expressed as a finite sum (called a linear combination) of the basis elements:\n\nwhere the  are scalars, called the coordinates (or the components) of the vector  with respect to the basis , and   elements of . Linear independence means that the coordinates  are uniquely determined for any vector in the vector space.\n\nFor example, the coordinate vectors , , to , form a basis of , called the standard basis, since any vector  can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these vectors:\n.\nThe corresponding coordinates , , ,  are just the Cartesian coordinates of the vector.\n\nEvery vector space has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an equivalent formulation of the Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases is equivalent to the axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.\n\nThe dimension of the coordinate space  is , by the basis exhibited above. The dimension of the polynomial ring F[x] introduced above is countably infinite, a basis is given by , , ,  A fortiori, the dimension of more general function spaces, such as the space of functions on some (bounded or unbounded) interval, is infinite.The indicator functions of intervals (of which there are infinitely many) are linearly independent, for example. Under suitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients involved, the dimension of the solution space of a homogeneous ordinary differential equation equals the degree of the equation. For example, the solution space for the above equation is generated by . These two functions are linearly independent over , so the dimension of this space is two, as is the degree of the equation.\n\nA field extension over the rationals  can be thought of as a vector space over  (by defining vector addition as field addition, defining scalar multiplication as field multiplication by elements of , and otherwise ignoring the field multiplication). The dimension (or degree) of the field extension  over  depends on . If  satisfies some polynomial equation\n\nwith rational coefficients  (in other words, if \u03b1 is algebraic), the dimension is finite. More precisely, it equals the degree of the minimal polynomial having \u03b1 as a root. For example, the complex numbers C are a two-dimensional real vector space, generated by 1 and the imaginary unit i. The latter satisfies i2 + 1 = 0, an equation of degree two. Thus, C is a two-dimensional R-vector space (and, as any field, one-dimensional as a vector space over itself, C). If \u03b1 is not algebraic, the dimension of Q(\u03b1) over Q is infinite. For instance, for \u03b1 = \u03c0 there is no such equation, in other words \u03c0 is transcendental.\n\nLinear maps and matrices\n\nThe relation of two vector spaces can be expressed by linear map or linear transformation. They are functions that reflect the vector space structure\u2014i.e., they preserve sums and scalar multiplication:\n and    for all  and  in , all  in .\n\nAn isomorphism is a linear map  such that there exists an inverse map , which is a map such that the two possible compositions  and  are identity maps. Equivalently,  is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective).  If there exists an isomorphism between  and , the two spaces are said to be isomorphic; they are then essentially identical as vector spaces, since all identities holding in  are, via , transported to similar ones in , and vice versa via .\n\n180px|right|thumb|Describing an arrow vector  by its coordinates  and  yields an isomorphism of vector spaces.\nFor example, the \"arrows in the plane\" and \"ordered pairs of numbers\" vector spaces in the introduction are isomorphic: a planar arrow  departing at the origin of some (fixed) coordinate system can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the - and -component of the arrow, as shown in the image at the right. Conversely, given a pair , the arrow going by  to the right (or to the left, if  is negative), and  up (down, if  is negative) turns back the arrow .\n\nLinear maps  between two vector spaces form a vector space , also denoted . The space of linear maps from  to  is called the dual vector space, denoted . Via the injective natural map , any vector space can be embedded into its bidual; the map is an isomorphism if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.\n\nOnce a basis of  is chosen, linear maps  are completely determined by specifying the images of the basis vectors, because any element of  is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them. If , a 1-to-1 correspondence between fixed bases of  and  gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of  to the corresponding basis element of . It is an isomorphism, by its very definition. Therefore, two vector spaces are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa. Another way to express this is that any vector space is completely classified (up to isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any n-dimensional -vector space  is isomorphic to . There is, however, no \"canonical\" or preferred isomorphism; actually an isomorphism  is equivalent to the choice of a basis of , by mapping the standard basis of  to , via . The freedom of choosing a convenient basis is particularly useful in the infinite-dimensional context; see below.\n\nMatrices\n\nright|thumb|200px|A typical matrix\nMatrices are a useful notion to encode linear maps.  They are written as a rectangular array of scalars as in the image at the right. Any -by- matrix  gives rise to a linear map from  to , by the following\n, where  denotes summation,\nor, using the matrix multiplication of the matrix  with the coordinate vector :\n.\nMoreover, after choosing bases of  and , any linear map  is uniquely represented by a matrix via this assignment.\n\n200px|right|thumb|The volume of this parallelepiped is the absolute value of the determinant of the 3-by-3 matrix formed by the vectors , , and .\nThe determinant  of a square matrix  is a scalar that tells whether the associated map is an isomorphism or not: to be so it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero. The linear transformation of  corresponding to a real n-by-n matrix is orientation preserving if and only if its determinant is positive.\n\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors\n\nEndomorphisms, linear maps , are particularly important since in this case vectors  can be compared with their image under , . Any nonzero vector  satisfying , where  is a scalar, is called an eigenvector of  with eigenvalue .The nomenclature derives from German \"eigen\", which means own or proper. Equivalently,  is an element of the kernel of the difference  (where Id is the identity map . If  is finite-dimensional, this can be rephrased using determinants:   having eigenvalue  is equivalent to\n.\nBy spelling out the definition of the determinant, the expression on the left hand side can be seen to be a polynomial function in , called the characteristic polynomial of .  If the field  is large enough to contain a zero of this polynomial (which automatically happens for  algebraically closed, such as ) any linear map has at least one eigenvector. The vector space  may or may not possess an eigenbasis, a basis consisting of eigenvectors. This phenomenon is governed by the Jordan canonical form of the map.. See also Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition. The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of  forms a vector space known as the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue (and ) in question. To achieve the spectral theorem, the corresponding statement in the infinite-dimensional case, the machinery of functional analysis is needed, see below.\n\nBasic constructions\nIn addition to the above concrete examples, there are a number of standard linear algebraic constructions that yield vector spaces related to given ones. In addition to the definitions given below, they are also characterized by universal properties, which determine an object  by specifying the linear maps from  to any other vector space.\n\nSubspaces and quotient spaces\n\nthumb|250px|right|A line passing through the origin (blue, thick) in  is a linear subspace. It is the intersection of two planes (green and yellow).\n\nA nonempty subset W of a vector space V that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the 0-vector of V) is called a linear subspace of V, or simply a subspace of V, when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space.This is typically the case when a vector space is also considered as an affine space. In this case, a linear subspace contains the zero vector, while an affine subspace does not necessarily contain it. Subspaces of V are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set S of vectors is called its span, and it is the smallest subspace of V containing the set S. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the linear combinations of elements of S.\n\nA linear subspace of dimension 1 is a vector line.  A linear subspace of dimension 2 is a vector plane. A linear subspace that contains all elements but one of a basis of the ambient space is a vector hyperplane. In a vector space of finite dimension , a vector hyperplane is thus a subspace of dimension .\n\nThe counterpart to subspaces are quotient vector spaces. Given any subspace , the quotient space V/W (\"V modulo W\") is defined as follows: as a set, it consists of  where v is an arbitrary vector in V. The sum of two such elements  and  is  and scalar multiplication is given by . The key point in this definition is that  if and only if the difference of v1 and v2 lies in W.Some authors (such as ) choose to start with this equivalence relation and derive the concrete shape of V/W from this. This way, the quotient space \"forgets\" information that is contained in the subspace W.\n\nThe kernel ker(f) of a linear map  consists of vectors v that are mapped to 0 in W. Both kernel and image  are subspaces of V and W, respectively. The existence of kernels and images is part of the statement that the category of vector spaces (over a fixed field F) is an abelian category, i.e. a corpus of mathematical objects and structure-preserving maps between them (a category) that behaves much like the category of abelian groups. Because of this, many statements such as the first isomorphism theorem (also called rank\u2013nullity theorem in matrix-related terms)\nV / ker(f) \u2261 im(f).\nand the second and third isomorphism theorem can be formulated and proven in a way very similar to the corresponding statements for groups.\n\nAn important example is the kernel of a linear map  for some fixed matrix A, as above. The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors x such that , which is precisely the set of solutions to the system of homogeneous linear equations belonging to A. This concept also extends to linear differential equations\n, where the coefficients ai are functions in x, too.\nIn the corresponding map\n,\nthe derivatives of the function f appear linearly (as opposed to f\u2032\u2032(x)2, for example). Since differentiation is a linear procedure (i.e.,  and  for a constant ) this assignment is linear, called a linear differential operator. In particular, the solutions to the differential equation  form a vector space (over  or ).\n\nDirect product and direct sum\n\nThe direct product of vector spaces and the direct sum of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.\n\nThe direct product  of a family of vector spaces Vi consists of the set of all tuples (, which specify for each index i in some index set I an element vi of Vi. Addition and scalar multiplication is performed componentwise. A variant of this construction is the direct sum  (also called coproduct and denoted ), where only tuples with finitely many nonzero vectors are allowed. If the index set I is finite, the two constructions agree, but in general they are different.\n\nTensor product\n\nThe tensor product , or simply , of two vector spaces V and W is one of the central notions of multilinear algebra which deals with extending notions such as linear maps to several variables. A map  is called bilinear if g is linear in both variables v and w.  That is to say, for fixed w the map  is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed v.\n\nThe tensor product is a particular vector space that is a universal recipient of bilinear maps g, as follows. It is defined as the vector space consisting of finite (formal) sums of symbols called tensors\nv1 \u2297 w1 + v2 \u2297 w2 + ... + vn \u2297 wn,\nsubject to the rules \n a \u00b7 (v \u2297 w) = (a \u00b7 v) \u2297 w = v \u2297 (a \u00b7 w), where a is a scalar,\n(v1 + v2) \u2297 w = v1 \u2297 w + v2 \u2297 w, and\nv \u2297 (w1 + w2) = v \u2297 w1 + v \u2297 w2.\nright|thumb|200px|Commutative diagram depicting the universal property of the tensor product.\nThese rules ensure that the map f from the  to  that maps a tuple  to  is bilinear. The universality states that given any vector space X and any bilinear map , there exists a unique map u, shown in the diagram with a dotted arrow, whose composition with f equals g: .. See also Yoneda lemma. This is called the universal property of the tensor product, an instance of the method\u2014much used in advanced abstract algebra\u2014to indirectly define objects by specifying maps from or to this object.\n\nVector spaces with additional structure\nFrom the point of view of linear algebra, vector spaces are completely understood insofar as any vector space is characterized, up to isomorphism, by its dimension. However, vector spaces per se do not offer a framework to deal with the question\u2014crucial to analysis\u2014whether a sequence of functions converges to another function. Likewise, linear algebra is not adapted to deal with infinite series, since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added. Therefore, the needs of functional analysis require considering additional structures.\n\nA vector space may be given a partial order \u2264, under which some vectors can be compared. For example, n-dimensional real space Rn can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise. Ordered vector spaces, for example Riesz spaces, are fundamental to Lebesgue integration, which relies on the ability to express a function as a difference of two positive functions\nf = f+ \u2212 f\u2212,\nwhere f+ denotes the positive part of f and f\u2212 the negative part.\n\nNormed vector spaces and inner product spaces\n\n\"Measuring\" vectors is done by specifying a norm, a datum which measures lengths of vectors, or by an inner product, which measures angles between vectors. Norms and inner products are denoted  and , respectively. The datum of an inner product entails that lengths of vectors can be defined too, by defining the associated norm . Vector spaces endowed with such data are known as normed vector spaces and inner product spaces, respectively.\n\nCoordinate space Fn can be equipped with the standard dot product:\n\nIn R2, this reflects the common notion of the angle between two vectors x and y, by the law of cosines:\n\nBecause of this, two vectors satisfying  are called orthogonal. An important variant of the standard dot product is used in Minkowski space: R4 endowed with the Lorentz product\n\nIn contrast to the standard dot product, it is not positive definite:  also takes negative values, for example for . Singling out the fourth coordinate\u2014corresponding to time, as opposed to three space-dimensions\u2014makes it useful for the mathematical treatment of special relativity.\n\nTopological vector spaces\n\nConvergence questions are treated by considering vector spaces V carrying a compatible topology, a structure that allows one to talk about elements being close to each other. Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be continuous maps.  Roughly, if x and y in V, and a in F vary by a bounded amount, then so do  and .This requirement implies that the topology gives rise to a uniform structure,  To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field F also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice are the reals or the complex numbers.\n\nIn such topological vector spaces one can consider series of vectors.  The infinite sum\n\ndenotes the limit of the corresponding finite partial sums of the sequence (fi)i\u2208N of elements of V. For example, the fi could be (real or complex) functions belonging to some function space V, in which case the series is a function series. The mode of convergence of the series depends on the topology imposed on the function space. In such cases, pointwise convergence and uniform convergence are two prominent examples.\n\nthumb|right|250px|Unit \"spheres\" in R2 consist of plane vectors of norm 1.  Depicted are the unit spheres in different p-norms, for p = 1, 2, and \u221e. The bigger diamond depicts points of 1-norm equal to 2.\nA way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any Cauchy sequence has a limit; such a vector space is called complete. Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval [0,1], equipped with the topology of uniform convergence is not complete because any continuous function on [0,1] can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the Weierstrass approximation theorem.  In contrast, the space of all continuous functions on [0,1] with the same topology is complete. A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors vn converges to v if and only if\n\nBanach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study\u2014a key piece of functional analysis\u2014focusses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence. The image at the right shows the equivalence of the 1-norm and \u221e-norm on R2: as the unit \"balls\" enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data.\n\nFrom a conceptual point of view, all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology. For example, instead of considering all linear maps (also called functionals) , maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous. In particular, the (topological) dual space  consists of continuous functionals  (or to ). The fundamental Hahn\u2013Banach theorem is concerned with separating subspaces of appropriate topological vector spaces by continuous functionals.\n\nBanach spaces\n\nBanach spaces, introduced by Stefan Banach, are complete normed vector spaces. \n\nA first example is the vector space  consisting of infinite vectors with real entries \n\nwhose -norm \n\ngiven by \n for \u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0 .\n \n\nThe topologies on the infinite-dimensional space \n \nare inequivalent for different . E.g. the sequence of vectors \n, \ni.e. the first  components are , the following ones are , converges to the zero vector for \n, \nbut does not for \n:\n, but \n\nMore generally than sequences of real numbers, functions \n\nare endowed with a norm that replaces the above sum by the Lebesgue integral\n\nThe space of integrable functions on a given domain \n \n(for example an interval) satisfying \n,\nand equipped with this norm are called Lebesgue spaces, denoted . The triangle inequality for \n\nis provided by the Minkowski inequality. For technical reasons, in the context of functions one has to identify functions that agree almost everywhere to get a norm, and not only a seminorm.  \n\nThese spaces are complete. (If one uses the Riemann integral instead, the space is not complete, which may be seen as a justification for Lebesgue's integration theory.\"Many functions in \n \nof Lebesgue measure, being unbounded, cannot be integrated with the classical Riemann integral. So spaces of Riemann integrable functions would not be complete in the \n\nnorm, and the orthogonal decomposition would not apply to them. This shows one of the advantages of Lebesgue integration.\", ) Concretely this means that for any sequence of Lebesgue-integrable functions\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\nwith\n, \nsatisfying the condition\n\nthere exists a function  belonging to the vector space  such that\n\nImposing boundedness conditions not only on the function, but also on its derivatives leads to Sobolev spaces.\n\nHilbert spaces\n\nright|thumb|400px|The succeeding snapshots show summation of 1 to 5 terms in approximating a periodic function (blue) by finite sum of sine functions (red).\nComplete inner product spaces are known as Hilbert spaces, in honor of David Hilbert.\nThe Hilbert space L2(\u03a9), with inner product given by\n\nwhere  denotes the complex conjugate of g(x),For p \u22602, Lp(\u03a9) is not a Hilbert space. is a key case.\n\nBy definition, in a Hilbert space any Cauchy sequence converges to a limit. Conversely, finding a sequence of functions fn with desirable properties that approximates a given limit function, is equally crucial. Early analysis, in the guise of the Taylor approximation, established an approximation of differentiable functions f by polynomials. By the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, every continuous function on  can be approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial. A similar approximation technique by trigonometric functions is commonly called Fourier expansion, and is much applied in engineering, see below. More generally, and more conceptually, the theorem yields a simple description of what \"basic functions\", or, in abstract Hilbert spaces, what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space H, in the sense that the closure of their span (i.e., finite linear combinations and limits of those) is the whole space. Such a set of functions is called a basis of H, its cardinality is known as the Hilbert space dimension.A basis of a Hilbert space is not the same thing as a basis in the sense of linear algebra above.  For distinction, the latter is then called a Hamel basis. Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes, but together with the Gram\u2013Schmidt process, it enables one to construct a basis of orthogonal vectors. Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nThe solutions to various differential equations can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert spaces. For example, a great many fields in physics and engineering lead to such equations and frequently solutions with particular physical properties are used as basis functions, often orthogonal. As an example from physics, the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics describes the change of physical properties in time by means of a partial differential equation, whose solutions are called wavefunctions. Definite values for physical properties such as energy, or momentum, correspond to eigenvalues of a certain (linear) differential operator and the associated wavefunctions are called eigenstates. The spectral theorem decomposes a linear compact operator acting on functions in terms of these eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues.\n\nAlgebras over fields\n\nright|thumb|250px|A hyperbola, given by the equation . The coordinate ring of functions on this hyperbola is given by , an infinite-dimensional vector space over .\nGeneral vector spaces do not possess a multiplication between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field. Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.\n\nCommutative algebra makes great use of rings of polynomials in one or several variables, introduced above. Their multiplication is both commutative and associative. These rings and their quotients form the basis of algebraic geometry, because they are rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects.\n\nAnother crucial example are Lie algebras, which are neither commutative nor associative, but the failure to be so is limited by the constraints ( denotes the product of  and ):\n (anticommutativity), and\n (Jacobi identity).\nExamples include the vector space of n-by-n matrices, with , the commutator of two matrices, and , endowed with the cross product.\n\nThe tensor algebra T(V) is a formal way of adding products to any vector space V to obtain an algebra. As a vector space, it is spanned by symbols, called simple tensors\n, where the degree  varies.\nThe multiplication is given by concatenating such symbols, imposing the distributive law under addition, and requiring that scalar multiplication commute with the tensor product \u2297, much the same way as with the tensor product of two vector spaces introduced above. In general, there are no relations between  and . Forcing two such elements to be equal leads to the symmetric algebra, whereas forcing  yields the exterior algebra.\n\nWhen a field,  is explicitly stated, a common term used is -algebra.\n\nApplications\nVector spaces have many applications as they occur frequently in common circumstances, namely wherever functions with values in some field are involved. They provide a framework to deal with analytical and geometrical problems, or are used in the Fourier transform. This list is not exhaustive: many more applications exist, for example in optimization. The minimax theorem of game theory stating the existence of a unique payoff when all players play optimally can be formulated and proven using vector spaces methods. Representation theory fruitfully transfers the good understanding of linear algebra and vector spaces to other mathematical domains such as group theory.See representation theory and group representation.\n\nDistributions\n\nA distribution (or generalized function) is a linear map assigning a number to each \"test\" function, typically a smooth function with compact support, in a continuous way: in the above terminology the space of distributions is the (continuous) dual of the test function space. The latter space is endowed with a topology that takes into account not only f itself, but also all its higher derivatives. A standard example is the result of integrating a test function f over some domain \u03a9:\n\nWhen  the set consisting of a single point, this reduces to the Dirac distribution, denoted by \u03b4, which associates to a test function f its value at the . Distributions are a powerful instrument to solve differential equations. Since all standard analytic notions such as derivatives are linear, they extend naturally to the space of distributions. Therefore, the equation in question can be transferred to a distribution space, which is bigger than the underlying function space, so that more flexible methods are available for solving the equation. For example, Green's functions and fundamental solutions are usually distributions rather than proper functions, and can then be used to find solutions of the equation with prescribed boundary conditions. The found solution can then in some cases be proven to be actually a true function, and a solution to the original equation (e.g., using the Lax\u2013Milgram theorem, a consequence of the Riesz representation theorem).\n\nFourier analysis\n\nthumb|right|200px|The heat equation describes the dissipation of physical properties over time, such as the decline of the temperature of a hot body placed in a colder environment (yellow depicts colder regions than red).\n\nResolving a periodic function into a sum of trigonometric functions forms a Fourier series, a technique much used in physics and engineering.Although the Fourier series is periodic, the technique can be applied to any L2 function on an interval by considering the function to be continued periodically outside the interval. See  The underlying vector space is usually the Hilbert space L2(0, 2\u03c0), for which the functions sin mx and cos mx (m an integer) form an orthogonal basis. The Fourier expansion of an L2 function f is\n\nThe coefficients am and bm are called Fourier coefficients of f, and are calculated by the formulas\n, \n\nIn physical terms the function is represented as a superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give information about the function's frequency spectrum. A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality. Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.\n\nFourier series are used to solve boundary value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the Fourier series can be used in sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT is one of the key tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.\n\nThe fast Fourier transform is an algorithm for rapidly computing the discrete Fourier transform. It is used not only for calculating the Fourier coefficients but, using the convolution theorem, also for computing the convolution of two finite sequences. They in turn are applied in digital filters and as a rapid multiplication algorithm for polynomials and large integers (Sch\u00f6nhage\u2013Strassen algorithm).\n\nDifferential geometry\n\nright|thumb|200px|The tangent space to the 2-sphere at some point is the infinite plane touching the sphere in this point.\nThe tangent plane to a surface at a point is naturally a vector space whose origin is identified with the point of contact.  The tangent plane is the best linear approximation, or linearization, of a surface at a point.That is to say , the plane passing through the point of contact P such that the distance from a point P1 on the surface to the plane is infinitesimally small compared to the distance from P1 to P in the limit as P1 approaches P along the surface. Even in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, there is typically no natural way to prescribe a basis of the tangent plane, and so it is conceived of as an abstract vector space rather than a real coordinate space. The tangent space is the generalization to higher-dimensional differentiable manifolds.\n\nRiemannian manifolds are manifolds whose tangent spaces are endowed with a suitable inner product.. See also Lorentzian manifold. Derived therefrom, the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes the matter and energy content of space-time. The tangent space of a Lie group can be given naturally the structure of a Lie algebra and can be used to classify compact Lie groups.\n\nGeneralizations\n\nVector bundles\n\nthumb|249px|right|A M\u00f6bius strip. Locally, it looks like .\nA vector bundle is a family of vector spaces parametrized continuously by a topological space X. More precisely, a vector bundle over X is a topological space E equipped with a continuous map \n\u03c0\u2009: E \u2192 X\nsuch that for every x in X, the fiber \u03c0\u22121(x) is a vector space. The case dim  is called a line bundle. For any vector space V, the projection  makes the product  into a \"trivial\" vector bundle. Vector bundles over X are required to be locally a product of X and some (fixed) vector space V: for every x in X, there is a neighborhood U of x such that the restriction of \u03c0 to \u03c0\u22121(U) is isomorphicThat is, there is a homeomorphism from \u03c0\u22121(U) to  which restricts to linear isomorphisms between fibers. to the trivial bundle . Despite their locally trivial character, vector bundles may (depending on the shape of the underlying space X) be \"twisted\" in the large (i.e., the bundle need not be (globally isomorphic to) the trivial bundle ). For example, the M\u00f6bius strip can be seen as a line bundle over the circle S1 (by identifying open intervals with the real line). It is, however, different from the cylinder , because the latter is orientable whereas the former is not.\n\nProperties of certain vector bundles provide information about the underlying topological space. For example, the tangent bundle consists of the collection of tangent spaces parametrized by the points of a differentiable manifold. The tangent bundle of the circle S1 is globally isomorphic to , since there is a global nonzero vector field on S1.A line bundle, such as the tangent bundle of S1 is trivial if and only if there is a section that vanishes nowhere, see . The sections of the tangent bundle are just vector fields. In contrast, by the hairy ball theorem, there is no (tangent) vector field on the 2-sphere S2 which is everywhere nonzero. K-theory studies the isomorphism classes of all vector bundles over some topological space. In addition to deepening topological and geometrical insight, it has purely algebraic consequences, such as the classification of finite-dimensional real division algebras: R, C, the quaternions H and the octonions O.\n\nThe cotangent bundle of a differentiable manifold consists, at every point of the manifold, of the dual of the tangent space, the cotangent space. Sections of that bundle are known as differential one-forms.\n\nModules\n\nModules are to rings what vector spaces are to fields: the same axioms, applied to a ring R instead of a field F, yield modules. The theory of modules, compared to that of vector spaces, is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have multiplicative inverses. For example, modules need not have bases, as the Z-module (i.e., abelian group) Z/2Z shows; those modules that do (including all vector spaces) are known as free modules. Nevertheless, a vector space can be compactly defined as a module over a ring which is a field with the elements being called vectors.  Some authors use the term vector space to mean modules over a division ring.Grillet, Pierre Antoine. Abstract algebra. Vol. 242. Springer Science & Business Media, 2007.  The algebro-geometric interpretation of commutative rings via their spectrum allows the development of concepts such as locally free modules, the algebraic counterpart to vector bundles.\n\nAffine and projective spaces\n\nthumb|right|200px|An affine plane (light blue) in R3. It is a two-dimensional subspace shifted by a vector x (red). \nRoughly, affine spaces are vector spaces whose origins are not specified. More precisely, an affine space is a set with a free transitive vector space action. In particular, a vector space is an affine space over itself, by the map\n.\nIf W is a vector space, then an affine subspace is a subset of W obtained by translating a linear subspace V by a fixed vector ; this space is denoted by  (it is a coset of V in W) and consists of all vectors of the form  for  An important example is the space of solutions of a system of inhomogeneous linear equations\nAx = b\ngeneralizing the homogeneous case  above. The space of solutions is the affine subspace  where x is a particular solution of the equation, and V is the space of solutions of the homogeneous equation (the nullspace of A).\n\nThe set of one-dimensional subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional vector space V is known as projective space; it may be used to formalize the idea of parallel lines intersecting at infinity. Grassmannians and flag manifolds generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension k and flags of subspaces, respectively.\n\nSee also\nVector (mathematics and physics), for a list of various kinds of vectors \n\nCartesian coordinate system\nEuclidean vector, for vectors in physics\nGraded vector space\n\nMetric space\nP-vector\nRiesz\u2013Fischer theorem\n\nSpace (mathematics)\nOrdered vector space\n\n Notes \n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\nAlgebra\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnalysis\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nHistorical references\n \n \n \n \n \n , reprint: \n \n \n \n \n\nFurther references\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n External links \n\n \n\nCategory:Concepts in physics\nCategory:Group theory\nCategory:Mathematical structures\nCategory:Vectors (mathematics and physics)\nCategory:Vector spaces"}
