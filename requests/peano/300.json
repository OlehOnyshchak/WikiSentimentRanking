T. Whittaker and G. N. Watson, first published by Cambridge University Press in 1902. (The first edition was Whittaker's alone; it was in later editions with Watson that this book is best known.)\n\nIts first, second, third, and the fourth, last edition were published in 1902, 1915, 1920, and 1927, respectively. Since then, it has continuously been reprinted and still in print today.\n\nThe book is notable for being the standard reference and textbook for a generation of Cambridge mathematicians including Littlewood and G. H. Hardy. Mary Cartwright studied it as preparation for her final honours on the advice of fellow student V.C. Morton, later Professor of Mathematics at Aberystwyth University. But its reach was much further than just the Cambridge school; Andr\u00e9 Weil in his obituary of the French mathematician Jean Delsarte noted that Delsarte always had a copy on his desk.\n\nToday, the book retains much of its original appeal. Some idiosyncratic but interesting problems from the salad days of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos are to be found in the exercises. It is terse, yet readable by the motivated student. It conforms to high standards of mathematical rigour, while compressing much actual formulaic information also.\n\nThe book was one of the earliest to use decimal numbering for its sections, an innovation the authors attribute to Giuseppe Peano.\n\n Contents \nBelow is the contens of the fourth edition:\n\nPart I.

{"title": "Absoluteness", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absoluteness", "text": "In mathematical logic, a formula is said to be absolute if it has the same truth value in each of some class of structures (also called models).  Theorems about absoluteness typically establish relationships between the absoluteness of formulas and their syntactic form. \n\nThere are two weaker forms of partial absoluteness. If the truth of a formula in each substructure N of a structure M follows from its truth in M, the formula is downward absolute. If the truth of a formula in a structure N implies its truth in each structure M extending N, the formula is upward absolute.\n\nIssues of absoluteness are particularly important in set theory and model theory, fields where multiple structures are considered simultaneously. In model theory, several basic results and definitions are motivated by absoluteness. In set theory, the issue of which properties of sets are absolute is well studied. The Shoenfield absoluteness theorem, due to Joseph Shoenfield (1961), establishes the absoluteness of a large class of formulas between a model of set theory and its constructible universe, with important methodological consequences. The absoluteness of large cardinal axioms is also studied, with positive and negative results known.\n\n In model theory \n\nIn model theory, there are several general results and definitions related to absoluteness. A fundamental example of downward absoluteness is that universal sentences (those with only universal quantifiers) that are true in a structure are also true in every substructure of the original structure. Conversely, existential sentences are upward absolute from a structure to any structure containing it. \n\nTwo structures are defined to be elementarily equivalent if they agree about the truth value of all sentences in their shared language, that is, if all sentences in their language are absolute between the two structures. A theory is defined to be model complete if whenever M  and N are models of the theory and M is a substructure of N, then M is an elementary substructure of N.\n\n In set theory \n\nA major part of modern set theory involves the study of different models of ZF and ZFC. It is crucial for the study of such models to know which properties of a set are absolute to different models. It is common to begin with a fixed model of set theory and only consider other transitive models containing the same ordinals as the fixed model. \n\nCertain properties are absolute to all transitive models of set theory, including the following (see Jech (2003 sec. I.12) and Kunen (1980 sec. IV.3)). \n x is the empty set.\n x is an ordinal.\n X is a finite ordinal. \n x = \u03c9.\n x is (the graph of) a function.\n\nOther properties, such as countability, are not absolute. \n\n Failure of absoluteness for countability \n\nSkolem's paradox is the seeming contradiction that on the one hand, the set of real numbers is uncountable (and this is provable from ZFC, or even from a small finite subsystem ZFC' of ZFC), while on the other hand there are countable transitive models of ZFC' (this is provable in ZFC), and the set of real numbers in such a model will be a countable set. The paradox can be resolved by noting that countability is not absolute to submodels of a particular model of ZFC. It is possible that a set X is countable in a model of set theory but uncountable in a submodel containing X, because the submodel may contain no bijection between X and \u03c9, while the definition of countability is the existence of such a bijection. The L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, when applied to ZFC, shows that this situation does occur.\n\n Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem \n\nShoenfield's absoluteness theorem shows that  and  sentences in the analytical hierarchy are absolute between a model V of ZF and the constructible universe L of the model, when interpreted as statements about the natural numbers in each model. The theorem can be relativized to allow the sentence to use sets of natural numbers from V as parameters, in which case L must be replaced by the smallest submodel containing those parameters and all the ordinals.  The theorem has corollaries that  sentences are upward absolute (if such a sentence holds in L then it holds in V) and  sentences are downward absolute (if they hold in V then they hold in L). Because any two transitive models of set theory with the same ordinals have the same constructible universe, Shoenfield's theorem shows that two such models must agree about the truth of all  sentences. \n\nOne consequence of Shoenfield's theorem relates to the axiom of choice. G\u00f6del proved that the constructible universe L always satisfies ZFC, including the axiom of choice, even when V is only assumed to satisfy ZF. Shoenfield's theorem shows that if there is a model of ZF in which a given  statement \u03c6 is false, then \u03c6 is also false in the constructible universe of that model. In contrapositive, this means that if ZFC proves a  sentence then that sentence is also provable in ZF. The same argument can be applied to any other principle which always holds in the constructible universe, such as the combinatorial principle \u25ca. Even if these principles are independent of ZF, each of their  consequences is already provable in ZF. In particular, this includes any of their consequences that can be expressed in the (first order) language of Peano arithmetic.\n\nShoenfield's theorem also shows that there are limits to the independence results that can be obtained by forcing. In particular, any sentence of Peano arithmetic is absolute to transitive models of set theory with the same ordinals. Thus it is not possible to use forcing to change the truth value of arithmetical sentences, as forcing does not change the ordinals of the model to which it is applied. Many famous open problems, such as the Riemann hypothesis and the P = NP problem, can be expressed as  sentences (or sentences of lower complexity), and thus cannot be proven independent of ZFC by forcing.\n\n Large cardinals \n\nThere are certain large cardinals that cannot exist in the constructible universe (L) of any model of set theory. Nevertheless, the constructible universe contains all the ordinal numbers that the original model of set theory contains. This \"paradox\" can be resolved by noting that the defining properties of some large cardinals are not absolute to submodels. \n\nOne example of such a nonabsolute large cardinal axiom is for measurable cardinals; for an ordinal to be a measurable cardinal there must exist another set (the measure) satisfying certain properties. It can be shown that no such measure is constructible.\n\n See also \n Conservative extension\n\n References \nJech, Thomas, 2003. Set Theory: The Third Millennium Edition, Revised and Expanded.

{"title": "Adam7 algorithm", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam7_algorithm", "text": "thumb|right|An illustration of Adam7 interlacing over a 16\u00d716 image\nthumb|right|An image being displayed using the Adam7 algorithm.\n\nAdam7 is an interlacing algorithm for raster images, best known as the interlacing scheme optionally used in PNG images. An Adam7 interlaced image is broken into seven subimages, which are defined by replicating this 8\u00d78 pattern across the full image.\n\n1 6 4 6 2 6 4 6\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 6 4 6 3 6 4 6\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nThe subimages are then stored in the image file in numerical order.\n\nAdam7 uses seven passes and operates in both dimensions, compared to only four passes in the vertical dimension used by GIF. This means that an approximation of the entire image can be perceived much more quickly in the early passes, particularly if interpolation algorithms such as bicubic interpolation are used.Introduction to PNG - nuwen.net\n\n History \nAdam7 is named after Adam M. Costello, who suggested the method on February 2, 1995, and after the seven steps involved.\n\nIt is a rearrangement of this five-pass scheme that had earlier been proposed by Lee Daniel Crocker:\n1 5 3 5\n5 4 5 4\n3 5 2 5\n5 4 5 4\nAlternative speculative proposals at the time included square spiral interlacing and using Peano curves, but these were rejected as being overcomplicated.\n\n Passes \nThe pixels included in each pass, and the total pixels encoded at that point are as follows:\n\nWhen rendering, the image will generally be interpolated at earlier stages, rather than just these pixels being rendered.\n\n Related algorithms \nAdam7 is a multiscale model of the data, similar to a discrete wavelet transform with Haar wavelets, though it starts from an 8\u00d78 block, and downsamples the image, rather than decimating (low-pass filtering, then downsampling). It thus offers worse frequency behavior, showing artifacts (pixelation) at the early stages, in return for simpler implementation.\n\n Iteration \nAdam7 arises from iteration of the following pattern:\n12\n33\nwhich may be interpreted as \"folding\" in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Similarly, GIF interlacing 1324 can be seen as iteration of the 12 pattern, but only in the vertical direction (12 expands to 1.2. which is filled in as 1324).\n\nUsing this 3-pass pattern means the first pass is (1/2)2\u00a0=\u00a01/4 (25%) of the image.\n\nIterating this pattern once yields a 5-pass scheme; after 3 passes this yields\n1 . 2 .\n. . . .\n3 . 3 .\n. . . .\nwhich is then filled in to:\n1 4 2 4\n5 5 5 5\n3 4 3 4\n5 5 5 5\nIn the 5-pass pattern, the first pass (1/4)2\u00a0=\u00a01/16 (6.25%) of the image.\n\nIterating again yields the 7-pass Adam7 scheme, where the first pass (1/8)2\u00a0=\u00a01/64 (1.5625%) of the image.\n\nIn principle this can be iterated, yielding a 9-pass scheme, an 11-pass scheme, and so forth, or alternatively an adaptive number of passes can be used, as many as the image size will allow (so the first pass consists of a single pixel), as is usual in scale-free multiscale modeling. In the context that PNG was developed (i.e., for the image sizes and connection speeds in question), a 7-pass scheme was seen as sufficient, and preferable to a simple 5-pass scheme.\n\n References \n\nExternal links\n Animated comparison of Adam7 and GIF interlacing\n\nCategory:Lossless compression algorithms\nCategory:Image compression"}
{"title": "Agda (programming language)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_%28programming_language%29", "text": "Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language originally developed by Ulf Norell at Chalmers University of Technology with implementation described in his PhD thesis.Ulf Norell. Towards a practical programming language based on dependent type theory. PhD Thesis. Chalmers University of Technology, 2007.  The original Agda system was developed at Chalmers by Catarina Coquand in 1999. The current version, originally known as Agda 2, is a full rewrite, which should be considered a new language that shares a name and tradition.\n\nAgda is also a proof assistant based on the propositions-as-types paradigm, but unlike Coq, has no support for tactics, and proofs are written in a functional programming style. The language has ordinary programming constructs such as data types, pattern matching, records, let expressions and modules, and a Haskell-like syntax. The system has Emacs and Atom interfaces but can also be run in batch mode from the command line.\n\nAgda is based on Zhaohui Luo's unified theory of dependent types (UTT),Luo, Zhaohui. Computation and reasoning: a type theory for computer science. Oxford University Press, Inc., 1994. a type theory similar to Martin-L\u00f6f type theory.\n\n Features \n\n Inductive types \nThe main way of defining data types in Agda is via inductive data types which are similar to algebraic data types in non-dependently typed programming languages.\n\nHere is a definition of Peano numbers in Agda:\n data \u2115 : Set where\n   zero : \u2115\n   suc : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nBasically, it means that there are two ways to construct a value of type \u2115, representing a natural number. To begin, zero is a natural number, and if n is a natural number, then suc n, standing for the successor of n, is a natural number too.\n\nHere is a definition of the \"less than or equal\" relation between two natural numbers:\n data _\u2264_ : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 Set where\n   z\u2264n : {n : \u2115} \u2192 zero \u2264 n\n   s\u2264s : {n m : \u2115} \u2192 n \u2264 m \u2192 suc n \u2264 suc m\nThe first constructor, z\u2264n, corresponds to the axiom that zero is less than or equal to any natural number. The second constructor, s\u2264s, corresponds to an inference rule, allowing to turn a proof of n \u2264 m into a proof of suc n \u2264 suc m. So the value s\u2264s {zero} {suc zero} (z\u2264n {suc zero}) is a proof that one (the successor of zero), is less than or equal to two (the successor of one). The parameters provided in curly brackets may be omitted if they can be inferred.\n\n Dependently typed pattern matching \nIn core type theory, induction and recursion principles are used to prove theorems about inductive types. In Agda, dependently typed pattern matching is used instead. For example, natural number addition can be defined like this:\n add zero n = n\n add (suc m) n = suc (add m n)\nThis way of writing recursive functions/inductive proofs is more natural than applying raw induction principles. In Agda, dependently typed pattern matching is a primitive of the language; the core language lacks the induction/recursion principles that pattern matching translates to.\n\n Metavariables \nOne of the distinctive features of Agda, when compared with other similar systems such as Coq, is heavy reliance on metavariables for program construction. For example, one can write functions like this in Agda:\n add : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n add x y = ?\n? here is a metavariable. When interacting with the system in emacs mode, it will show the user expected type and allow them to refine the metavariable, i.e., to replace it with more detailed code. This feature allows incremental program construction in a way similar to tactics-based proof assistants such as Coq.\n\n Proof automation \nProgramming in pure type theory involves a lot of tedious and repetitive proofs, and Agda has no support for tactics. Instead, Agda has support for automation via reflection. The reflection mechanism allows one to quote program fragments into \u2013 or unquote them from \u2013 the abstract syntax tree. The way reflection is used is similar to the way Template Haskell works.Van Der Walt, Paul, and Wouter Swierstra. \"Engineering proof by reflection in Agda.\" In Implementation and Application of Functional Languages, pp. 157-173. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2013. \n\nAnother mechanism for proof automation is proof search action in emacs mode. It enumerates possible proof terms (limited to 5 seconds), and if one of the terms fits the specification, it will be put in the meta variable where the action is invoked. This action accepts hints, e.g., which theorems and from which modules can be used, whether the action can use pattern matching, etc.Kokke, Pepijn, and Wouter Swierstra. \"Auto in Agda.\"\n\n Termination checking \nAgda is a total language, i.e., each program in it must terminate and all possible patterns must be matched. Without this feature, the logic behind the language becomes inconsistent, and it becomes possible to prove arbitrary statements. For termination checking, Agda uses the approach of the Foetus termination checker.Abel, Andreas. \"foetus \u2013 Termination checker for simple functional programs.\" Programming Lab Report 474 (1998).\n\n Standard library \nAgda has an extensive de facto standard library, which includes many useful definitions and theorems about basic data structures, such as natural numbers, lists, and vectors. The library is in beta, and is under active development.\n\n Unicode \nOne of the more notable features of Agda is a heavy reliance on Unicode in program source code. The standard emacs mode uses shortcuts for input, such as \\Sigma for \u03a3.\n\n Backends \nThere are two compiler backends, MAlonzo for Haskell and one for JavaScript.\n\nSee also\n Coq\n Isabelle (proof assistant)\n HOL (proof assistant)\n\n References \n\n External links \n \n Dependently Typed Programming in Agda, by Ulf Norell\n A Brief Overview of Agda, by Ana Bove, Peter Dybjer, and Ulf Norell\n Introduction to Agda, a five-part YouTube playlist by Daniel Peebles\n Brutal [Meta]Introduction to Dependent Types in Agda\n Agda Tutorial: \"explore programming in Agda without theoretical background\"\n\nCategory:Programming languages\nCategory:Dependently typed languages\nCategory:Functional languages\nCategory:Pattern matching programming languages\nCategory:Academic programming languages\nCategory:Statically typed programming languages\nCategory:Proof assistants\nCategory:Free software programmed in Haskell\nCategory:Haskell programming language family\nCategory:Cross-platform free software\nCategory:Free compilers and interpreters\nCategory:Chalmers University of Technology\nCategory:Programming languages created in 2007\nCategory:2007 software"}
{"title": "Apostolos Doxiadis", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolos_Doxiadis", "text": "Apostolos K. Doxiadis (; born 1953) is a Greek writer. He is best known for his international bestsellers Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture (2000) and Logicomix (2009).\n\nEarly life\nDoxiadis was born in Australia, where his father, the architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis was working. Soon after his birth, the family returned to Athens, where Doxiadis grew up. Though his earliest interests were in poetry, fiction and the theatre, an intense interest in mathematics led Doxiadis to leave school at age fifteen, to attend Columbia University, in New York, from which he obtained a bachelor's degree in Mathematics in May 1972. He then attended the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes in Paris from which he got a master's degree, with a thesis on the mathematical modeling of the nervous system. His father\u2019s death and family reasons made him return to Greece in 1975, interrupting his graduate studies. In Greece, although involved for some years with the computer software industry, Doxiadis returned to his childhood and adolescence loves of theatre and the cinema, before becoming a full-time writer.\n\nWork\n\nFiction in Greek\nDoxiadis began to write in Greek. His first published work was A Parallel Life (\u0392\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, 1985), a novella set in the monastic communities of 4th century CE Egypt. His first novel, Makavettas (\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2, 1988), recounted the adventures of a fictional power-hungry colonel at the time of the Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974. Written in a tongue-in-cheek imitation of Greek folk military memoirs, such as that of Yannis Makriyannis, it follows the plot of Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, of which the eponymous hero\u2019s name is a Hellenized form. Doxiadis next novel, Uncle Petros and Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture (\u039f \u0398\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u0395\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bd\u03c4\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03c7, 1992), was the first long work of fiction whose plot takes place in the world of pure mathematics research. The first Greek critics did not find the mathematical themes appealing, and it received mediocre reviews, unlike Doxiadis\u2019s first two works, which were well received. \u03a4he novella The Three Little Men (\u03a4\u03b1 \u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u0391\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1, 1998), attempts a modern-day retelling of the tale of a classic fairy-tale.\n\nFiction in English\nIn 1998, Doxiadis translated into English, significantly re-working, his third novel, which was published in England in 2000 as Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture (UK publisher: Faber and Faber; United States publisher: Bloomsbury USA.) The book became an international bestseller, and has been published to date in more than thirty-five languages. It has received the praise of, among others, Nobel Laureate John Nash, British mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah, critic George Steiner and psychiatrist Oliver Sacks. Uncle Petros is one of the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.http://1001beforeyoudie.com \n  \nDoxiadis\u2019 next project, which took over five years to complete, was the graphic novel Logicomix (2009), a number one bestseller on the New York Times Bestseller List and an international bestseller, already published in over twenty languages. Logicomix was co-authored with computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou, with art work by Alecos Papadatos (pencils) and Annie Di Donna (color). Renowned comics historian and critic R. C. Harvey, in the Comics Journal, called Logicomix \u201ca tour-de-force\u201d a \u201cvirtuoso performance\u201d,http://classic.tcj.com/history/logicomix-a-tour-de-force/ while The Sunday Times\u2019 Brian Appleyard called it \u201cprobably the best and certainly the most extraordinary graphic novel\u201d he has read. Logicomix is one of Paul Gravett\u2019s 1001 Comics You Must Read Before you Die. http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/1001_comics/\n\nTheatre and cinema\nIn the early stage of his career, Doxiadis directed in the professional theatre, in Athens, and worked as translator, translating, among other plays, William Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, as well as Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Mourning Becomes Electra.\n\nHe has written two plays for the theatre. The first was a full-length shadow-puppet play The Tragical History of Jackson Pollock, Abstract Expressionist (1999), in English, of which he also designed and directed the Athens performance.Watch a performance, filmed by Doxiadis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJMyQ4Bkiow In this play, Doxiadis realized some of his views on \u201cepic theatre\u201d, in other words a theatre based on storytelling.Read his own views on the matter in an interview: http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=158&Itemid=94 His second play, Incompleteness (2005), is an imaginary account of the last seventeen days in the life of the great logician Kurt G\u00f6del, which G\u00f6del spent in a Princeton, New Jersey, hospital, refusing to eat out of fear that he was being poisoned. The play was staged in Athens, in 2006, as Dekati Evdomi Nyhta (Seventeenth Night) with the actor Yorgos Kotanidis in the role of Kurt G\u00f6del.\n\nDoxiadis has also written and directed two feature-length films, in Greek, Underground Passage (\u03a5\u03c0\u03cc\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae, 1983) and Terirem (\u03a4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc, 1987). The latter won the CICAE (International Confederation of Art Cinemas) prize for Best Film in the 1988 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nScholarship\nDoxiadis has a lifelong interest in logic, cognitive psychology and rhetoric, as well as the theoretical study of narrative.Some of his published papers are reprinted here:  In 2007, he organized, with mathematician Barry Mazur, a meeting on the theoretical investigation of the relationship of mathematics and narrative, whose proceedings were published as Circles Disturbed, The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative (2012).http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9764.html Doxiadis has lectured extensively on his theoretical interests.http://royalsociety.org/exhibitions/one-culture/apostolos-doxiadis/ Doxiadis\u2019 recent work has led him to formulate a theory about the development of deductive proof in Classical Greece, which lays emphasis on influences from pre-existing patterns in narrative and, especially, Archaic Age Poetry.An earlier draft of a write-up of some of these ideas can be found at https://www.academia.edu/3222520/A_Streetcar_Named_among_Other_Things_Proof\n\nAwards and honours\nUncle Petros and Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture was the first recipient of the Premio PeanoAssociazione Subalpina Mathesis \u2013 Premio Peano  the first international award for books inspired by mathematics and short-listed for the Prix M\u00e9dicis. Logicomix has earned numerous awards, among them the Bertrand Russell Society Award, the Royal Booksellers Association Award (the Netherlands), the New Atlantic Booksellers Award (USA), the Prix Tangente (France), the Premio Carlo Boscarato (Italy), the Comicdom Award (Greece).

Each set contains at least one, and possibly infinitely many, elements. The axiom of choice allows us to arbitrarily select a single element from each set, forming a corresponding family of elements (xi) also indexed over the real numbers, with xi drawn from Si. In general, the collections may be indexed over any set I, not just R.\n\nIn mathematics, the axiom of choice, or AC, is an axiom of set theory equivalent to the statement that the Cartesian product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin, even if the collection is infinite.

The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by Ernst Zermelo in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem..\n\nIn many cases, such a selection can be made without invoking the axiom of choice; this is in particular the case if the number of sets is finite, or if a selection rule is available \u2013 some distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one element in each set. An illustrative example is sets picked from the natural numbers. From such sets, one may always select the smallest number, e.g. in {{4, 5, 6}, {10, 12}, {1, 400, 617, 8000}} the smallest elements are {4, 10, 1}. In this case, \"select the smallest number\" is a choice function. Even if infinitely many sets were collected from the natural numbers, it will always be possible to choose the smallest element from each set to produce a set. That is, the choice function provides the set of chosen elements. However, no choice function is known for the collection of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers (if there are non-constructible reals). In that case, the axiom of choice must be invoked. \n\nBertrand Russell coined an analogy: for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate selection; this makes it possible to directly define a choice function. For an infinite collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), there is no obvious way to make a function that selects one sock from each pair, without invoking the axiom of choice.\n\nAlthough originally controversial, the axiom of choice is now used without reservation by most mathematicians,Jech, 1977, p.\u00a0348ff; Martin-L\u00f6f 2008, p.\u00a0210. According to :\n The status of the Axiom of Choice has become less controversial in recent years. To most mathematicians it seems quite plausible and it has so many important applications in practically all branches of mathematics that not to accept it would seem to be a wilful hobbling of the practicing mathematician. and it is included in the standard form of axiomatic set theory, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). One motivation for this use is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as Tychonoff's theorem, require the axiom of choice for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice, such as the axiom of determinacy. The axiom of choice is avoided in some varieties of constructive mathematics, although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom of choice is embraced.\n\nStatement\nA choice function is a function f, defined on a collection X of nonempty sets, such that for every set A in X, f(A) is an element of A.  With this concept, the axiom can be stated:\n\nFormally, this may be expressed as follows:\n\nThus, the negation of the axiom of choice states that there exists a collection of nonempty sets that has no choice function.\n\nEach choice function on a collection X of nonempty sets is an element of the Cartesian product of the sets in X. This is not the most general situation of a Cartesian product of a family of sets, where a given set can occur more than once as a factor; however, one can focus on elements of such a product that select the same element every time a given set appears as factor, and such elements correspond to an element of the Cartesian product of all distinct sets in the family. The axiom of choice asserts the existence of such elements; it is therefore equivalent to:\n\nGiven any family of nonempty sets, their Cartesian product is a nonempty set.\n\nNomenclature ZF, AC, and ZFC\nIn this article and other discussions of the Axiom of Choice the following abbreviations are common:\nAC \u2013 the Axiom of Choice.\nZF \u2013 Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory omitting the Axiom of Choice.\nZFC \u2013 Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, extended to include the Axiom of Choice.\n\nVariants\nThere are many other equivalent statements of the axiom of choice. These are equivalent in the sense that, in the presence of other basic axioms of set theory, they imply the axiom of choice and are implied by it.\n\nOne variation avoids the use of choice functions by, in effect, replacing each choice function with its range.\nGiven any set X of pairwise disjoint non-empty sets, there exists at least one set C that contains exactly one element in common with each of the sets in X.. According to , this was the formulation of the axiom of choice which was originally given by . See also  for this formulation.\nThis guarantees for any partition of a set X the existence of a subset C of X containing exactly one element from each part of the partition.\n\nAnother equivalent axiom only considers collections X that are essentially powersets of other sets:\nFor any set A, the power set of A (with the empty set removed) has a choice function.\nAuthors who use this formulation often speak of the choice function on A, but be advised that this is a slightly different notion of choice function.  Its domain is the powerset of A (with the empty set removed), and so makes sense for any set A, whereas with the definition used elsewhere in this article, the domain of a choice function on a collection of sets is that collection, and so only makes sense for sets of sets.  With this alternate notion of choice function, the axiom of choice can be compactly stated as\nEvery set has a choice function..\nwhich is equivalent to\nFor any set A there is a function f such that for any non-empty subset B of A, f(B) lies in B.\nThe negation of the axiom can thus be expressed as:\nThere is a set A such that for all functions f (on the set of non-empty subsets of A), there is a B such that f(B) does not lie in B.\n\nRestriction to finite sets\nThe statement of the axiom of choice does not specify whether the collection of nonempty sets is finite or infinite, and thus implies that every finite collection of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, that particular case is a theorem of the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice (ZF); it is easily proved by mathematical induction.Tourlakis (2003), pp. 209\u2013210, 215\u2013216. In the even simpler case of a collection of one set, a choice function just corresponds to an element, so this instance of the axiom of choice says that every nonempty set has an element; this holds trivially. The axiom of choice can be seen as asserting the generalization of this property, already evident for finite collections, to arbitrary collections.\n\nUsage\nUntil the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly, although it had not yet been formally stated. For example, after having established that the set X contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said \"let F(s) be one of the members of s for all s in X\" to define a function F.  In general, it is impossible to prove that F exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until Zermelo.\n\nNot every situation requires the axiom of choice. For finite sets X, the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory. In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box. Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on. The number of boxes is finite, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end. The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on. (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of mathematical induction to prove \"for every natural number k, every family of k nonempty sets has a choice function.\") This method cannot, however, be used to show that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function, as is asserted by the axiom of countable choice. If the method is applied to an infinite sequence (Xi : i\u2208\u03c9) of nonempty sets, a function is obtained at each finite stage, but there is no stage at which a choice function for the entire family is constructed, and no \"limiting\" choice function can be constructed, in general, in ZF without the axiom of choice.\n\nExamples\nThe nature of the individual nonempty sets in the collection may make it possible to avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections. For example, suppose that each member of the collection X is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers. Every such subset has a smallest element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it maps each set to the least element of that set. This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set, and makes it unnecessary to apply the axiom of choice.\n\nThe difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set.  If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our set exists?  For example, suppose that X is the set of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers.  First we might try to proceed as if X were finite.  If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because X is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of X.  Next we might try specifying the least element from each set.  But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: if x is in (0,1), then so is x/2, and x/2 is always strictly smaller than x.  So this attempt also fails.\n\nAdditionally, consider for instance the unit circle S, and the action on S by a group G consisting of all rational rotations. Namely, these are rotations by angles which are rational multiples of\u00a0\u03c0. Here G is countable while S is uncountable. Hence S breaks up into uncountably many orbits under\u00a0G. Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset X of S with the property that all of its translates by G are disjoint from\u00a0X. The set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Since X is not measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive finite measure on S, finding an algorithm to select a point in each orbit requires the axiom of choice. See non-measurable set for more details.\n\nThe reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are well-ordered: every nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element under the natural ordering.  One might say, \"Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering.  Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering.\"  The problem then becomes that of constructing a well-ordering, which turns out to require the axiom of choice for its existence; every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice holds.\n\nCriticism and acceptance\nA proof requiring the axiom of choice may establish the existence of an object without explicitly defining the object in the language of set theory. For example, while the axiom of choice implies that there is a well-ordering of the real numbers, there are models of set theory with the axiom of choice in which no well-ordering of the reals is definable. Similarly, although a subset of the real numbers that is not Lebesgue measurable can be proved to exist using the axiom of choice, it is consistent that no such set is definable..\n\nThe axiom of choice proves the existence of these intangibles (objects that are proved to exist, but which cannot be explicitly constructed), which may conflict with some philosophical principles.. Because there is no canonical well-ordering of all sets, a construction that relies on a well-ordering may not produce a canonical result, even if a canonical result is desired (as is often the case in category theory). This has been used as an argument against the use of the axiom of choice.\n\nAnother argument against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem counterintuitive.. One example is the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox which says that it is possible to decompose the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are non-measurable sets.\n\nDespite these seemingly paradoxical facts, most mathematicians accept the axiom of choice as a valid principle for proving new results in mathematics. The debate is interesting enough, however, that it is considered of note when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is logically equivalent (with just the ZF axioms) to the axiom of choice, and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of choice to be false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type which requires the axiom of choice to be true.\n\nIt is possible to prove many theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation; such statements will be true in any model of ZF, regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model. The restriction to ZF renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its negation unprovable. For example, the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox is neither provable nor disprovable from ZF alone: it is impossible to construct the required decomposition of the unit ball in ZF, but also impossible to prove there is no such decomposition. Similarly, all the statements listed below which require choice or some weaker version thereof for their proof are unprovable in ZF, but since each is provable in ZF plus the axiom of choice, there are models of ZF in which each statement is true. Statements such as the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox can be rephrased as conditional statements, for example, \"If AC holds, then the decomposition in the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox exists.\" Such conditional statements are provable in ZF when the original statements are provable from ZF and the axiom of choice.\n\nIn constructive mathematics\n\nAs discussed above, in ZFC, the axiom of choice is able to provide \"nonconstructive proofs\" in which the existence of an object is proved although no explicit example is constructed. ZFC, however, is still formalized in classical logic. The axiom of choice has also been thoroughly studied in the context of constructive mathematics, where non-classical logic is employed. The status of the axiom of choice varies between different varieties of constructive mathematics.\n\nIn Martin-L\u00f6f type theory and higher-order Heyting arithmetic, the appropriate statement of the axiom of choice is (depending on approach) included as an axiom or provable as a theorem.Per Martin-L\u00f6f, Intuitionistic type theory, 1980.\nAnne Sjerp Troelstra, Metamathematical investigation of intuitionistic arithmetic and analysis, Springer, 1973. Errett Bishop argued that the axiom of choice was constructively acceptable, saying\n\nIn constructive set theory, however, Diaconescu's theorem shows that the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle (unlike in Martin-L\u00f6f type theory, where it does not). Thus the axiom of choice is not generally available in constructive set theory. A cause for this difference is that the axiom of choice in type theory does not have the extensionality properties that the axiom of choice in constructive set theory does.\n\nSome results in constructive set theory use the axiom of countable choice or the axiom of dependent choice, which do not imply the law of the excluded middle in constructive set theory. Although the axiom of countable choice in particular is commonly used in constructive mathematics, its use has also been questioned.Fred Richman, \u201cConstructive mathematics without choice\u201d, in: Reuniting the Antipodes\u2014Constructive and Nonstandard Views of the Continuum (P. Schuster et al., eds), Synth\u00e8se Library 306, 199\u2013205, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, 2001.\n\nIndependence\n\nIn 1938, Kurt G\u00f6del showed that the negation of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an inner model (the constructible universe) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent if ZF itself is consistent.   In 1963, Paul Cohen employed the technique of forcing, developed for this purpose, to show that, assuming ZF is consistent, the axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF. He did this by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF\u00acC (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF\u00acC is consistent.\n\nTogether these results establish that the axiom of choice is logically independent of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.\n\nOne argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it because it allows one to prove some simplifying propositions that otherwise could not be proved. Many theorems which are provable using choice are of an elegant general character: every ideal in a ring is contained in a maximal ideal, every vector space has a basis, and every product of compact spaces is compact. Without the axiom of choice, these theorems may not hold for mathematical objects of large cardinality.\n\nThe proof of the independence result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased in the language of Peano arithmetic, are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC.This is because arithmetical statements are absolute to the constructible universe L. Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem gives a more general result. Statements in this class include the statement that P = NP, the Riemann hypothesis, and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.\n\nThe axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of ZF.  For example, the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZFC. However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.\n\nStronger axioms\nThe axiom of constructibility and the generalized continuum hypothesis each imply the axiom of choice and so are strictly stronger than it.  In class theories such as Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory and Morse\u2013Kelley set theory, there is an axiom called the axiom of global choice that is stronger than the axiom of choice for sets because it also applies to proper classes. The axiom of global choice follows from the axiom of limitation of size.\n\nEquivalents\nThere are important statements that, assuming the axioms of ZF but neither AC nor \u00acAC, are equivalent to the axiom of choice.See , for a structured list of 74 equivalents. See , for 86 equivalents with source references. The most important among them are Zorn's lemma and the well-ordering theorem. In fact, Zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem.\n\nSet theory\nWell-ordering theorem: Every set can be well-ordered. Consequently, every cardinal has an initial ordinal.\nTarski's theorem about choice: For every infinite set A, there is a bijective map between the sets  A and A\u00d7A.\nTrichotomy: If two sets are given, then either they have the same cardinality, or one has a smaller cardinality than the other.\nGiven two non-empty sets, one has a surjection to the other.\nThe Cartesian product of any family of nonempty sets is nonempty.\nK\u00f6nig's theorem: Colloquially, the sum of a sequence of cardinals is strictly less than the product of a sequence of larger cardinals. (The reason for the term \"colloquially\" is that the sum or product of a \"sequence\" of cardinals cannot be defined without some aspect of the axiom of choice.)\nEvery surjective function has a right inverse.\nOrder theory\nZorn's lemma: Every non-empty partially ordered set in which every chain (i.e., totally ordered subset) has an upper bound contains at least one maximal element.\nHausdorff maximal principle: In any partially ordered set, every totally ordered subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset.

The special case where S is the set of all first-order sentences in a given signature is weaker, equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem; see the section \"Weaker forms\" below.\nGraph theory\nEvery connected graph has a spanning tree.; . See in particular Theorem 2.1, pp.\u00a0192\u2013193.\n\nCategory theory\nThere are several results in category theory which invoke the axiom of choice for their proof.  These results might be weaker than, equivalent to, or stronger than the axiom of choice, depending on the strength of the technical foundations.  For example, if one defines categories in terms of sets, that is, as sets of objects and morphisms (usually called a small category), or even locally small categories, whose hom-objects are sets, then there is no category of all sets, and so it is difficult for a category-theoretic formulation to apply to all sets.  On the other hand, other foundational descriptions of category theory are considerably stronger, and an identical category-theoretic statement of choice may be stronger than the standard formulation, \u00e0 la class theory, mentioned above.\n\nExamples of category-theoretic statements which require choice include:\nEvery small category has a skeleton.\nIf two small categories are weakly equivalent, then they are equivalent.\nEvery continuous functor on a small-complete category which satisfies the appropriate solution set condition has a left-adjoint (the Freyd adjoint functor theorem).\n\nWeaker forms\nThere are several weaker statements that are not equivalent to the axiom of choice, but are closely related. One example is the axiom of dependent choice (DC). A still weaker example is the axiom of countable choice (AC\u03c9 or CC), which states that a choice function exists for any countable set of nonempty sets. These axioms are sufficient for many proofs in elementary mathematical analysis, and are consistent with some principles, such as the Lebesgue measurability of all sets of reals, that are disprovable from the full axiom of choice.\n\nOther choice axioms weaker than axiom of choice include the Boolean prime ideal theorem and the axiom of uniformization.  The former is equivalent in ZF to the existence of an ultrafilter containing each given filter, proved by Tarski in 1930.\n\nResults requiring AC (or weaker forms) but weaker than it\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that it shows up. Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC).  Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.\n\nSet theory\nAny union of countably many countable sets is itself countable (because it is necessary to choose a particular ordering for each of the countably many sets).\nIf the set A is infinite, then there exists an injection from the natural numbers N to A (see Dedekind infinite).It is shown by , that the axiom of countable choice implies the equivalence of infinite and Dedekind-infinite sets, but that the equivalence of infinite and Dedekind-infinite sets does not imply the axiom of countable choice in ZF.\nEight definitions of a finite set are equivalent.It was shown by  and others using Mostowski models that eight definitions of a finite set are independent in ZF without AC, although they are equivalent when AC is assumed. The definitions are I-finite, Ia-finite, II-finite, III-finite, IV-finite, V-finite, VI-finite and VII-finite. I-finiteness is the same as normal finiteness. IV-finiteness is the same as Dedekind-finiteness.\nEvery infinite game  in which  is a Borel subset of Baire space is determined.\nMeasure theory\nThe Vitali theorem on the existence of non-measurable sets which states that there is a subset of the real numbers that is not Lebesgue measurable.\nThe Hausdorff paradox.\nThe Banach\u2013Tarski paradox.\nThe Lebesgue measure of a countable disjoint union of measurable sets is equal to the sum of the measures of the individual sets.\nAlgebra\nEvery field has an algebraic closure.\nEvery field extension has a transcendence basis.\nStone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras needs the Boolean prime ideal theorem.\nThe Nielsen\u2013Schreier theorem, that every subgroup of a free group is free.\nThe additive groups of R and C are isomorphic.\nFunctional analysis\nThe Hahn\u2013Banach theorem in functional analysis, allowing the extension of linear functionals\nThe theorem that every Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis.\nThe Banach\u2013Alaoglu theorem about compactness of sets of functionals.\nThe Baire category theorem about complete metric spaces, and its consequences, such as the open mapping theorem and the closed graph theorem.\nOn every infinite-dimensional topological vector space there is a discontinuous linear map.\nGeneral topology\nA uniform space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.\nEvery Tychonoff space has a Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification.\nMathematical logic\nG\u00f6del's completeness theorem for first-order logic: every consistent set of first-order sentences has a completion. That is, every consistent set of first-order sentences can be extended to a maximal consistent set.\n\nPossibly equivalent implications of AC\nThere are several historically important set-theoretic statements implied by AC whose equivalence to AC is open. The partition principle, which was formulated before AC itself, was cited by Zermelo as a justification for believing AC. In 1906 Russell declared PP to be equivalent, but whether the Partition Principle implies AC is still the oldest open problem in set theory, and the equivalences of the other statements are similarly hard old open problems. In every known model of ZF where choice fails, these statements fail too, but it is unknown if they can hold without choice.\n\nSet theory\nPartition principle: if there is a surjection from A to B, there is an injection from B to A. Equivalently, every partition P of a set S is less than or equal to S in size.\nConverse Schr\u00f6der\u2013Bernstein theorem: if two sets have surjections to each other, they are equinumerous.\nWeak partition principle: A partition of a set S cannot be strictly larger than S. If WPP holds, this already implies the existence of a non-measurable set. Each of the previous three statements is implied by the preceding one, but it is unknown if any of these implications can be reversed.\nThere is no infinite decreasing sequence of cardinals. The equivalence was conjectured by Schoenflies in 1905.\nAbstract algebra\nHahn embedding theorem: Every ordered abelian group G order-embeds subgroup of the additive group \u211d\u03a9 endowed with a lexicographical order, where \u03a9 is the set of Archimedean equivalence classes of \u03a9. This equivalence was conjectured by Hahn in 1907.\n\nStronger forms of the negation of AC\nNow, consider stronger forms of the negation of AC.  For example, if we abbreviate by BP the claim that every set of real numbers has the property of Baire, then BP is stronger than \u00acAC, which asserts the nonexistence of any choice function on perhaps only a single set of nonempty sets.  Note that strengthened negations may be compatible with weakened forms of AC.  For example, ZF + DCAxiom of dependent choice + BP is consistent, if ZF is.\n\nIt is also consistent with ZF + DC that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable; however, this consistency result, due to Robert M. Solovay, cannot be proved in ZFC itself, but requires a mild large cardinal assumption (the existence of an inaccessible cardinal). The much stronger axiom of determinacy, or AD, implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, and has the perfect set property (all three of these results are refuted by AC itself). ZF + DC + AD is consistent provided that a sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom is consistent (the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals).\n\nQuine's system of axiomatic set theory, \"New Foundations\" (NF), takes its name from the title (\u201cNew Foundations for Mathematical Logic\u201d) of the 1937 article which introduced it. In the NF axiomatic system, the axiom of choice can be disproved.\n\nStatements consistent with the negation of AC\nThere are models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false.  We shall abbreviate \"Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the negation of the axiom of choice\" by ZF\u00acC.  For certain models of ZF\u00acC, it is possible to prove the negation of some standard facts.\nNote that any model of ZF\u00acC is also a model of ZF, so for each of the following statements, there exists a model of ZF in which that statement is true. For each of the following statements, there is some model of ZF\u00acC where it is true:\n\nIn some model, there is a set that can be partitioned into strictly more equivalence classes than the original set has elements, and a function whose domain is strictly smaller than its range. In fact, this is the case in all known models.\nThere is a function f from the real numbers to the real numbers such that f is not continuous at a, but f is sequentially continuous at a, i.e., for any sequence {xn} converging to a, limn f(xn)=f(a).\nIn some model, there is an infinite set of real numbers without a countably infinite subset.\nIn some model, the real numbers are a countable union of countable sets., Theorem 10.6 with proof.\nIn some model, there is a field with no algebraic closure.\nIn all models of ZF\u00acC there is a vector space with no basis.\nIn some model in which there is a vector space with two bases of different cardinalities.\nIn some model there is a free complete boolean algebra on countably many generators.\nIn some model there is a set that cannot be linearly ordered.\n\nFor proofs, see .\n\nThere exists a model of ZF\u00acC in which every set in Rn is measurable.  Thus it is possible to exclude counterintuitive results like the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox which are provable in ZFC.  Furthermore, this is possible whilst assuming the Axiom of dependent choice, which is weaker than AC but sufficient to develop most of real analysis.\nIn all models of ZF\u00acC, the generalized continuum hypothesis does not hold.\n\n Axiom of choice in type theory \n\nIn type theory, a different kind of statement is known as the axiom of choice. This form begins with two types, \u03c3 and \u03c4, and a relation R between objects of type \u03c3 and objects of type \u03c4. The axiom of choice states that if for each x of type \u03c3 there exists a y of type \u03c4 such that R(x,y), then there is a function f from objects of type \u03c3 to objects of type \u03c4 such that R(x,f(x)) holds for all x of type \u03c3:\n\nUnlike in set theory, the axiom of choice in type theory is typically stated as an axiom scheme, in which R varies over all formulas or over all formulas of a particular logical form.\n\nQuotes\n\nThis is a joke: although the three are all mathematically equivalent, many mathematicians find the axiom of choice to be intuitive, the well-ordering principle to be counterintuitive, and Zorn's lemma to be too complex for any intuition.\n\nThe observation here is that one can define a function to select from an infinite number of pairs of shoes by stating for example, to choose a left shoe.  Without the axiom of choice, one cannot assert that such a function exists for pairs of socks, because left and right socks are (presumably) indistinguishable.\n\nPolish-American mathematician Jan Mycielski relates this anecdote in a 2006 article in the Notices of the AMS..\n\nThis quote comes from the famous April Fools' Day article in the computer recreations column of the Scientific American, April 1989.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \nThomas Jech, \"About the Axiom of Choice.\" Handbook of Mathematical Logic, John Barwise, ed., 1977.\n \n Per Martin-L\u00f6f, \"100 years of Zermelo's axiom of choice: What was the problem with it?\", in Logicism, Intuitionism, and Formalism: What Has Become of Them?, Sten Lindstr\u00f6m, Erik Palmgren, Krister Segerberg, and Viggo Stoltenberg-Hansen, editors (2008). \n \n , available as a Dover Publications reprint, 2013, .\n \nHerman Rubin, Jean E.

{"title": "Axiom schema", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema", "text": "In mathematical logic, an axiom schema (plural: axiom schemata or axiom schemas) generalizes the notion of axiom.\n\nFormal definition\nAn axiom schema is a formula in the metalanguage of an axiomatic system, in which one or more schematic variables appear. These variables, which are metalinguistic constructs, stand for any term or subformula of the system, which may or may not be required to satisfy certain conditions. Often, such conditions require that certain variables be free, or that certain variables not appear in the subformula or term.\n\nFinite axiomatization\nGiven that the number of possible subformulas or terms that can be inserted in place of a schematic variable is countably infinite, an axiom schema stands for a countably infinite set of axioms. This set can usually be defined recursively. A theory that can be axiomatized without schemata is said to be finitely axiomatized. Theories that can be finitely axiomatized are seen as a bit more metamathematically elegant, even if they are less practical for deductive work.\n\nExamples\nTwo very well known instances of axiom schemata are the:\n induction schema that is part of Peano's axioms for the arithmetic of the natural numbers;\n axiom schema of replacement that is part of the standard ZFC axiomatization of set theory.\nCzes\u0142aw Ryll-Nardzewski proved that Peano arithmetic cannot be finitely axiomatized and Richard Montague proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.Czes\u0142aw Ryll-Nardzewski 1952; Richard Montague 1961. Hence, the axiom schemata cannot be eliminated from these theories. This is also the case for quite a few other axiomatic theories in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, etc.\n\nFinitely axiomatized theories\nAll theorems of ZFC are also theorems of von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory, but the latter can be finitely axiomatized. The set theory New Foundations can be finitely axiomatized, but only with some loss of elegance.\n\nIn higher-order logic\nSchematic variables in first-order logic are usually trivially eliminable in second-order logic, because a schematic variable is often a placeholder for any property or relation over the individuals of the theory. This is the case with the schemata of Induction and Replacement mentioned above. Higher-order logic allows quantified variables to range over all possible properties or relations.\n\nSee also\n\n Axiom schema of predicative separation\n Axiom schema of replacement\n Axiom schema of specification\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n .\n \n .\n .\n .\n .\n\n*\nCategory:Formal systems"}
{"title": "Categorical theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_theory", "text": "In mathematical logic, a theory is categorical if it has exactly one model (up to isomorphism).Some authors define a theory to be categorical if all of its models are isomorphic.  This definition makes the inconsistent theory categorical, since it has no models and therefore vacuously meets the criterion.  Such a theory can be viewed as defining its model, uniquely characterizing its structure.\n\nIn first-order logic, only theories with a finite model can be categorical.  Higher-order logic contains categorical theories with an infinite model.  For example, the second-order Peano axioms are categorical, having a unique model whose domain is the set of natural numbers .\n\nIn model theory, the notion of a categorical theory is refined with respect to cardinality.  A theory is -categorical (or categorical in ) if it has exactly one model of cardinality  up to isomorphism.\nMorley's categoricity theorem is a theorem of , which states that if a first-order theory in a countable language is categorical in some uncountable cardinality, then it is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities.\n\n extended Morley's theorem to uncountable languages: if the language has cardinality  and a theory is categorical in some uncountable cardinal greater than or equal to  then it is categorical in all cardinalities greater than\u00a0.\n\nHistory and motivation\nOswald Veblen in 1904 defined a theory to be categorical if all of its models are isomorphic. It follows from the definition above and the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem that any first-order theory with a model of infinite cardinality cannot be categorical. One is then immediately led to the more subtle notion of -categoricity, which asks: for which cardinals  is there exactly one model of cardinality  of the given theory T up to isomorphism?  This is a deep question and significant progress was only made in 1954 when Jerzy \u0141o\u015b noticed that, at least for complete theories T over countable languages with at least one infinite model, he could only find three ways for T to be -categorical at some\u00a0:\n\nT is totally categorical, i.e. T is -categorical for all infinite cardinals\u00a0.\nT is uncountably categorical, i.e. T is -categorical if and only if  is an uncountable cardinal.\nT is countably categorical, i.e. T is -categorical if and only if  is a countable cardinal.\n\nIn other words, he observed that, in all the cases he could think of, -categoricity at any one uncountable cardinal implied -categoricity at all other uncountable cardinals. This observation spurred a great amount of research into the 1960s, eventually culminating in Michael Morley's famous result that these are in fact the only possibilities.  The theory was subsequently extended and refined by Saharon Shelah in the 1970s and beyond, leading to stability theory and Shelah's more general programme of classification theory.\n\nExamples\nThere are not many natural examples of theories that are categorical in some uncountable cardinal. The known examples include:\n Pure identity theory (with no functions, constants, predicates other than \"=\", or axioms).\n The classic example is the theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic. Categoricity does not say that all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 as large as the complex numbers C are the same as C; it only asserts that they are isomorphic as fields to C. It follows that although the completed p-adic closures Cp are all isomorphic as fields to C, they may (and in fact do) have completely different topological and analytic properties. The theory of algebraically closed fields of given characteristic is not categorical in  (the countable infinite cardinal); there are models of transcendence degree 0, 1, 2, ..., .\n Vector spaces over a given countable field. This includes abelian groups of given prime exponent (essentially the same as vector spaces over a finite field) and divisible torsion-free abelian groups (essentially the same as vector spaces over the rationals).\n The theory of the set of natural numbers with a successor function.\n\nThere are also examples of theories that are categorical in  but not categorical in uncountable cardinals. \nThe simplest example is the theory of an equivalence relation with exactly two equivalence classes both of which are infinite. Another example is the theory of dense linear orders with no endpoints; Cantor proved that any such countable linear order is isomorphic to the rational numbers.\n\nProperties\n\nEvery categorical theory is complete.  However, the converse does not hold.\n\nAny theory T categorical in some infinite cardinal  is very close to being complete. More precisely, the \u0141o\u015b\u2013Vaught test states that if a satisfiable theory  has no finite models and is categorical in some infinite cardinal  at least equal to the cardinality of its language, then the theory is complete.  The reason is that all infinite models are equivalent to some model of cardinal  by the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, and so are all equivalent as the theory is categorical in . Therefore, the theory is complete as all models are equivalent.  The assumption that the theory have no finite models is necessary.Marker (2002) p. 42\n\nSee also\nSpectrum of a theory\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n Hodges, Wilfrid, \"First-order Model Theory\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2005 Edition), Edward N.

{"title": "Chaos game", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game", "text": "thumb|right|200px|Animated creation of a Sierpinski triangle using a chaos game method\nthumb|right|200px|Animation of chaos game method\nthumb|right|200px|The way the \"chaos game\" works is illustrated well when every path is accounted for.\n\nIn mathematics, the term chaos game originally referred to a method of creating a fractal, using a polygon and an initial point selected at random inside it. The fractal is created by iteratively creating a sequence of points, starting with the initial random point, in which each point in the sequence is a given fraction of the distance between the previous point and one of the vertices of the polygon; the vertex is chosen at random in each iteration. Repeating this iterative process a large number of times, selecting the vertex at random on each iteration, and throwing out the first few points in the sequence, will often (but not always) produce a fractal shape. Using a regular triangle and the factor 1/2 will result in the Sierpinski triangle, while creating the proper arrangement with four points and a factor 1/2 will create a display of a \"Sierpinski Tetrahedron\", the three-dimensional analogue of the Sierpinski triangle. As the number of points is increased to a number N, the arrangement forms a corresponding (N-1)-dimensional Sierpinski Simplex.\n\nThe term has been generalized to refer to a method of generating the attractor, or the fixed point, of any iterated function system (IFS). Starting with any point x0, successive iterations are formed as xk+1 = fr(xk), where fr is a member of the given IFS randomly selected for each iteration. The iterations converge to the fixed point of the IFS. Whenever x0 belongs to the attractor of the IFS, all iterations xk stay inside the attractor and, with probability 1, form a dense set in the latter.\n\nThe \"chaos game\" method plots points in random order all over the attractor. This is in contrast to other methods of drawing fractals, which test each pixel on the screen to see whether it belongs to the fractal. The general shape of a fractal can be plotted quickly with the \"chaos game\" method, but it may be difficult to plot some areas of the fractal in detail.\n\nThe \"chaos game\" method is mentioned in Tom Stoppard's 1993 play Arcadia.\n\nWith the aid of the \"chaos game\" a new fractal can be made and while making the new fractal some parameters can be obtained. These parameters are useful for applications of fractal theory such as classification and identification. The new fractal is self-similar to the original in some important features such as fractal dimension.\n\nIf in the \"chaos game\" you start at each vertex and go through all possible paths that the game can take, you will get the same image as with only taking one random path. However, taking more than one path is rarely done since the overhead for keeping track of every path makes it far slower to calculate. This method does have the advantages of illustrating how the fractal is formed more clearly than the standard method as well as being deterministic.\n\nRestricted chaos game\n\nthumb|right|200px|A point inside a square repeatedly jumps half of the distance towards a randomly chosen vertex. No fractal appears.\n\nIf the chaos game is run with a square, no fractal appears and the interior of the square fills evenly with points. However, if restrictions are placed on the choice of vertices, fractals will appear in the square. For example, if the current vertex cannot be chosen in the next iteration, this fractal appears:\n\nA point inside a square repeatedly jumps half of the distance towards a randomly chosen vertex, but the currently chosen vertex cannot be the same as the previously chosen vertex.|center|300px\n\nIf the current vertex cannot be one place away (anti-clockwise) from the previously chosen vertex, this fractal appears:\n\nA point inside a square repeatedly jumps half of the distance towards a randomly chosen vertex, but the currently chosen vertex cannot be 1 place away (anti-clockwise) from the previously chosen vertex.|center|300px\n\nIf the point is prevented from landing on a particular region of the square, the shape of that region will be reproduced as a fractal in other and apparently unrestricted parts of the square. Here, for example, is the fractal produced when the point cannot jump so as to land on a red Om symbol at the center of the square:\n\nA fractal created by a point jumping towards a randomly chosen vertex of a square but prevented from landing on an Om symbol at the square's center|center|300px\n\nSee also\nChaos theory\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Fractals\nCategory:Chaos theory"}
{"title": "Charles Sanders Peirce", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce", "text": "Charles Sanders Peirce (,\"Peirce\", in the case of C. S. Peirce, always rhymes with the English-language word \"terse\" and so, in most dialects, is pronounced exactly like the English-language word \"\". ; September 10, 1839 \u2013 April 19, 1914) was an American philosopher, logician, mathematician, and scientist who is sometimes known as \"the father of pragmatism\". He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for thirty years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism.\n\nAn innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself, first and foremost, a logician. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th century Western philosophy. Additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulated mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. As early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. The same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers. See  Also \n\nIn 1934, the philosopher Paul Weiss called Peirce \"the most original and versatile of American philosophers and America's greatest logician\". Webster's Biographical Dictionary said in 1943 that Peirce was \"now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time\". Keith Devlin similarly referred to Peirce as one of the greatest philosophers ever.\n\nLife\nthumb|left|upright=1.25|Peirce's birthplace. Now part of Lesley University's Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences\n\nPeirce was born at 3 Phillips Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and Benjamin Peirce, himself a professor of astronomy and mathematics at Harvard University and perhaps the first serious research mathematician in America. At age\u00a012, Charles read his older brother's copy of Richard Whately's Elements of Logic, then the leading English-language text on the subject. So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning.Fisch, Max, \"Introduction\", Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 1:xvii, find phrase \"One episode\". He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degree (1862) from Harvard. In 1863 the Lawrence Scientific School awarded him a Bachelor of Science degree, Harvard's first summa cum laude chemistry degree.\"Peirce, Charles Sanders\" (1898), The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, v. 8, p. 409. His academic record was otherwise undistinguished. At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Chauncey Wright, and William James. One of his Harvard instructors, Charles William Eliot, formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard (1869\u20131909\u2014a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life\u2014repeatedly vetoed Peirce'e employment at the university.\n\nPeirce suffered from his late-teens onward from a nervous condition then known as \"facial neuralgia\", which would today be diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. His biographer, Joseph Brent, says that when in the throes of its pain \"he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper\". Its consequences may have led to the social isolation which made his life's later years so tragic.\n\nEarly employment\nBetween 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the United States Coast Survey and its successor, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,Burch, Robert (2001, 2010), \"Charles Sanders Peirce\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy where he enjoyed his highly influential father's protection until the latter's death in 1880. That employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the American Civil War; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the Boston Brahmin Peirces sympathized with the Confederacy. At the Survey, he worked mainly in geodesy and gravimetry, refining the use of pendulums to determine small local variations in the Earth's gravity. He was elected a resident fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in January 1867. The Survey sent him to Europe five times, first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a solar eclipse. There, he sought out Augustus De Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, and William Kingdon Clifford, British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own. From 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an Assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of stars and the shape of the Milky Way.Moore, Edward C., and Robin, Richard S., eds., (1964), Studies in the Philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce, Second Series, Amherst: U. of Massachusetts Press. On Peirce the astronomer, see Lenzen's chapter. On April 20, 1877 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the meter as so many wavelengths of light of a certain frequency,Fisch, Max (1983), \"Peirce as Scientist, mathematician, historian, Logician, and Philosopher\", Studies in Logic (new edition), see p. x. the kind of definition employed from 1960 to 1983.\n\nDuring the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months. Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands during 1883\u20131909, on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic Century Dictionary.See \"Peirce Edition Project (UQ\u00c0M) \u2013 in short \" from PEP-UQ\u00c0M. In 1885, an investigation by the Allison Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent Julius Hilgard and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds.Houser, Nathan, \"Introduction\", Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 5:xxviii\u2013xxix, find \"Allison\". In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent Thomas Corwin Mendenhall's request. He never again held regular employment.\n\nJohns Hopkins University\nIn 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at Johns Hopkins University, which had strong departments in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy (Royce and Dewey completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by G. Stanley Hall and studied by Joseph Jastrow, who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by J.\u00a0J. Sylvester, who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). His Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University (1883) contained works by himself and Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd, Benjamin Ives Gilman, and Oscar Howard Mitchell, several of whom were his graduate students.Houser, Nathan (1989), \"Introduction\",  Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 4:xxxviii, find \"Eighty-nine\". Peirce's nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held.\n\nBrent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, Simon Newcomb. Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as \"his difficult personality\". Conversely, Keith Devlin believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.\n\nPeirce's personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay (\"Zina\"), left him in 1875, Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with Juliette, whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai, and nationality (she spoke French) remains uncertain.Houser, Nathan, \"Introduction\", Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 6, first paragraph. When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette. That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884. Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success.In 1885 (); in 1890 and 1900 (p. 273); in 1891 (pp. 215\u201316); and in 1892 (pp. 151\u201352, 222). He had no children by either marriage.\n\nPoverty\nthumb|left|Arisbe in 2011\nframe|Cambridge, where Peirce was born and raised, New York City, where he often visited and sometimes lived, and Milford, where he spent the later years of his life with his second wife Juliette. \nthumb|upright=1.25|Juliette and Charles by a well at their home Arisbe in 1907\nthumb|Charles and Juliette Peirce's grave\n\nIn 1887 Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy  of rural land near Milford, Pennsylvania, which never yielded an economic return. There he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design. The Peirces named the property \"Arisbe\". There they lived with few interruptions for the rest of their lives, Charles writing prolifically, much of it unpublished to this day (see Works). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties. He spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while. Several people, including his brother James Mills Peirce and his neighbors, relatives of Gifford Pinchot, settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.\n\nPeirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay, mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries, and reviews for The Nation (with whose editor, Wendell Phillips Garrison, he became friendly). He did translations for the Smithsonian Institution, at its director Samuel Langley's instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley's research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing. He began but did not complete a number of books. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland appointed him to the Assay Commission.\n\nFrom 1890 on, he had a friend and admirer in Judge Francis C. Russell of Chicago, who introduced Peirce to editor Paul Carus and owner Edward C. Hegeler of the pioneering American philosophy journal The Monist, which eventually published at least 14 articles by Peirce. He wrote many texts in James Mark Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology (1901\u20131905); half of those credited to him appear to have been written actually by Christine Ladd-Franklin under his supervision. He applied in 1902 to the newly formed Carnegie Institution for a grant to write a systematic book of his life's work. The application was doomed; his nemesis, Newcomb, served on the Institution's executive committee, and its President had been the President of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce's dismissal.\n\nThe one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend William James, dedicating his Will to Believe (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903). Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him. It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used \"Santiago\" (\"St. James\" in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce for discussion and references).\n\nPeirce died destitute in Milford, Pennsylvania, twenty years before his widow. Juliette Peirce kept the urn with Peirce's ashes at Arisbe. In 1934, Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot arranged for Juliette's burial on Milford Cemetery. The urn with Peirce's ashes was interred with Juliette.In 2018, plans have been made to erect a memorial monument for Peirce at the site of burial \u2013 see: Justin Weinberg, 'A Proper Memorial Monument for Peirce', website Daily Nous, March 14, 2018.\n\nSlavery, the American Civil War, and racism\nPeirce grew up in a home where the supremacy of the white Anglo-Saxon male was taken for granted and Negro slavery was considered natural.\n\nUntil the outbreak of the Civil War his father described himself as a secessionist, but after the outbreak of the war, this stopped and he became a Union partisan, providing donations to the Sanitary Commission, the leading Northern war charity. No members of the Peirce family volunteered or enlisted. Peirce shared his father's views and liked to use the following syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic (see also: ):\n\nAll Men are equal in their political rights.\nNegroes are Men.\nTherefore, negroes are equal in political rights to whites.\n\nReception\nBertrand Russell (1959) wrote \"Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century and certainly the greatest American thinker ever\".Russell, Bertrand (1959), Wisdom of the West, p. 276 Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, published from 1910 to 1913, do not mention Peirce (Peirce's work was not widely known until later).Anellis, Irving H. (1995), \"Peirce Rustled, Russell Pierced: How Charles Peirce and Bertrand Russell Viewed Each Other's Work in Logic, and an Assessment of Russell's Accuracy and Role in the Historiography of Logic\", Modern Logic 5, 270\u2013328. Arisbe Eprint A. N. Whitehead, while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own \"process\" thinking. (On Peirce and process metaphysics, see Lowe 1964). Karl Popper viewed Peirce as \"one of the greatest philosophers of all times\".Popper, Karl (1972), Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, p. 212 Yet Peirce's achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries William James and Josiah RoyceSee Royce, Josiah, and Kernan, W. Fergus (1916), \"Charles Sanders Peirce\", The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Method v. 13, pp. 701\u201309. Arisbe Eprint admired him and Cassius Jackson Keyser, at Columbia and C. K. Ogden, wrote about Peirce with respect but to no immediate effect.\n\nThe first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce's student Morris Raphael Cohen, the editor of an anthology of Peirce's writings titled Chance, Love, and Logic (1923), and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings.Ketner et al. (1986), Comprehensive Bibliography, p. iii John Dewey, studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins. From 1916 onward, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 Logic: The Theory of Inquiry is much influenced by Peirce.Hookway, Christopher (2008), \"Pragmatism\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The publication of the first six volumes of Collected Papers (1931\u20131935), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds, did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss, did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and Goudge (1950), the 1941 PhD thesis by Arthur W. Burks (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Its Transactions, an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce's pragmatism and American philosophy has appeared since 1965. (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to transactionalism).\n\nIn 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics Carolyn Eisele (1902\u20132000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her forty years of research on Peirce, 'the mathematician and scientist', culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). Beginning around 1960, the philosopher and historian of ideas Max Fisch (1900\u20131995) emerged as an authority on Peirce (Fisch, 1986).Fisch, Max (1986), Peirce, Semeiotic, and Pragmatism, Kenneth Laine Ketner and Christian J. W. Kloesel, eds., Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana U. Press. He includes many of his relevant articles in a survey (Fisch 1986: 422\u201348) of the impact of Peirce's thought through 1983.\n\nPeirce has gained a significant international following, marked by university research centers devoted to Peirce studies and pragmatism in Brazil (CeneP/CIEP), Finland (HPRC and ), Germany (Wirth's group, Hoffman's and Otte's group, and Deuser's and H\u00e4rle's groupTheological Research Group in C.S.

His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish, British, and Brazilian Peirce scholars of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the University of Toronto, thanks in part to the leadership of Thomas Goudge and David Savan. In recent years, U.S. Peirce scholars have clustered at Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis, home of the Peirce Edition Project (PEP) \u2013, and Pennsylvania State University.\n\nIn recent years, Peirce's trichotomy of signs is exploited by a growing number of practitioners for marketing and design tasks.\n\nWorks\nPeirce's reputation rests largely on a number of academic papers published in American scientific and scholarly journals such as Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, The Monist, Popular Science Monthly, the American Journal of Mathematics, Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences, The Nation, and others. See Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime for an extensive list with links to them online. The only full-length book (neither extract nor pamphlet) that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetimeBurks, Arthur, Introduction, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 7, p. xi. was Photometric Researches (1878), a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy. While at Johns Hopkins, he edited Studies in Logic (1883), containing chapters by himself and his graduate students. Besides lectures during his years (1879\u20131884) as lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least nine series of lectures, many now published; see Lectures by Peirce.\n\nAfter Peirce's death, Harvard University obtained from Peirce's widow the papers found in his study, but did not microfilm them until 1964.

It can be tessellated, that is, multiple copies can be joined together continuously edge-to-edge.Peirce's most important work in pure mathematics was in logical and foundational areas. He also worked on linear algebra, matrices, various geometries, topology and Listing numbers, Bell numbers, graphs, the four-color problem, and the nature of continuity.\n\nHe worked on applied mathematics in economics, engineering, and map projections (such as the Peirce quincuncial projection), and was especially active in probability and statistics.Burks, Arthur W., \"Review: Charles S.

In the same paper Peirce gave, years before Dedekind, the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as \"Dedekind-finite\", and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an infinite set (Dedekind-infinite), as a set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets.\n\nIn 1885Peirce (1885), \"On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation\", American Journal of Mathematics 7, two parts, first part published 1885, pp. 180\u2013202 (see Houser in linked paragraph in \"Introduction\" in Writings of Charles S.

Those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared in The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce (1976), edited by mathematician Carolyn Eisele.\n\nNature of mathematics\n\nPeirce agreed with Auguste Comte in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce classified mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the real numbers) and continua. Influenced by his father Benjamin, Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science about drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.Peirce (1898), \"The Logic of Mathematics in Relation to Education\" in Educational Review v. 15, pp. 209\u201316 (via Internet Archive).

Much of the mathematics of relations now taken for granted was \"borrowed\" from Peirce, not always with all due credit; on that and on how the young Bertrand Russell, especially his Principles of Mathematics and Principia Mathematica, did not do Peirce justice, see Anellis (1995). In 1918 the logician C.\u00a0I. Lewis wrote, \"The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer\u2014at least in the nineteenth century.\"Lewis, Clarence Irving (1918), A Survey of Symbolic Logic, see ch. 1, \u00a77 \"Peirce\", pp. 79\u2013106, see p. 79 (Internet Archive). Note that Lewis's bibliography lists works by Frege, tagged with asterisks as important. Beginning in 1940, Alfred Tarski and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce's larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of relation algebra.\n\nRelational logic gained applications. In mathematics, it influenced the abstract analysis of E. H. Moore and the lattice theory of Garrett Birkhoff. In computer science, the relational model for databases was developed with Peircean ideas in work of Edgar F. Codd, who was a doctoral studentAvery, John (2003) Information theory and evolution, p. 167; also Mitchell, Melanie, \"My Scientific Ancestry\". of Arthur W. Burks, a Peirce scholar.

Excerpt with article's last five pages. documented that Frege's work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries, although it was published four years before the work of Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell. Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce's \"On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation\" (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by Peano and Schr\u00f6der, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce's notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, philosophy of language, and the foundations of mathematics.\n\nPeirce's work on formal logic had admirers besides Ernst Schr\u00f6der:\n Philosophical algebraist William Kingdon CliffordBeil, Ralph G. and Ketner, Kenneth (2003), \"Peirce, Clifford, and Quantum Theory\", International Journal of Theoretical Physics v. 42, n. 9, pp. 1957\u201372. and logician William Ernest Johnson, both British;\n The Polish school of logic and foundational mathematics, including Alfred Tarski;\n Arthur Prior, who praised and studied Peirce's logical work in a 1964 paper and in Formal Logic (saying on page 4 that Peirce \"perhaps had a keener eye for essentials than any other logician before or since\").\n\nA philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings and, along with Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982); the Introduction in Nathan Houser et al. (1997);Houser, Roberts, and Van Evra, eds. (1997), Studies in the Logic of Charles Sanders Peirce, Indiana U., Bloomington, IN. and Randall Dipert's chapter in Cheryl Misak (2004).Misak, ed.

He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum;Peirce (1903 MS), Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 6.176: \"But I now define a pseudo-continuum as that which modern writers on the theory of functions call a continuum. But this is fully represented by [...] the totality of real values, rational and irrational [...].\" that a true continuum is the real subject matter of analysis situs (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds\u2014and within any lapse of time has room for\u2014any Aleph number (any infinite multitude as he called it) of instants.Peirce (1902 MS) and Ransdell, Joseph, ed.

Abstract.\n\nProbability and statistics\nPeirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that spontaneity (absolute chance) is real (see Tychism on his view). Most of his statistical writings promote the frequency interpretation of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) probability when such models are not based on objective randomization.Peirce condemned the use of \"certain likelihoods\" (The Essential Peirce, 2:108\u201309) even more strongly than he criticized Bayesian methods. Indeed Peirce used a bit of Bayesian inference in criticizing parapsychology (Writings of Charles S. Pierce, 6:76). Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his possible world semantics introduced the \"propensity\" theory of probability before Karl Popper.Miller, Richard W. (1975), \"Propensity: Popper or Peirce?\", British Journal for the Philosophy of Science (site), v. 26, n. 2, pp. 123\u201332. . Eprint.Haack, Susan and Kolenda, Konstantin (1977), \"Two Fallibilists in Search of the Truth\",  Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes, v. 51, pp. 63\u2013104.  Peirce (sometimes with Joseph Jastrow) investigated the probability judgments of experimental subjects, \"perhaps the very first\" elicitation and estimation of subjective probabilities in experimental psychology and (what came to be called) Bayesian statistics.\n\nPeirce was one of the founders of statistics. He formulated modern statistics in \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" (1877\u20131878) and \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (1883). With a repeated measures design, Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow introduced blinded, controlled randomized experiments in 1884Peirce CS, Jastrow J. On Small Differences in Sensation. Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences 1885; 3:73\u201383. (Hacking 1990:205) (before Ronald A. Fisher). He invented optimal design for experiments on gravity, in which he \"corrected the means\". He used correlation and smoothing. Peirce extended the work on outliers by Benjamin Peirce, his father. He introduced terms \"confidence\" and \"likelihood\" (before Jerzy Neyman and Fisher). (See Stephen Stigler's historical books and Ian Hacking 1990).\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPeirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including mathematics, logic, philosophy, statistics, astronomy, metrology, geodesy, experimental psychology, economics, linguistics, and the history and philosophy of science. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.\n\nPeirce's philosophy includes (see below in related sections) a pervasive three-category system, belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion (fallibilism) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways\u2014including philosophical pragmatism (which he founded), critical common-sensism, and scientific method\u2014and, in metaphysics: Scholastic realism, e.g. John Duns Scotus, belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, objective idealism, and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love.  In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like skepticism and positivism, respectively, in others' work.  However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an anti-skepticism and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity,Peirce (1897) \"Fallibilism, Continuity, and Evolution\", Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.141\u201375 (Eprint), placed by the Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, editors directly after \"F.R.L.\" (1899, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.135\u201340). and pragmatism commits one to anti-nominalist belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453\u201357).\n\nFor Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences.Peirce (1903), Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.180\u2013202 and (1906) \"The Basis of Pragmaticism\", The Essential Peirce, 2:372\u201373, see \"Philosophy\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. He divided such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.\n\nTheory of categories\n\nOn May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled \"On a New List of Categories\" to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, and G. W. F. Hegel, categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life. Peirce scholars generally regard the \"New List\" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's \"architectonic\", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in \"How To Make Our Ideas Clear\" (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.\n\n\"On a New List of Categories\" is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.See in \"Firstness\", \"Secondness\", and \"Thirdness\" in Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. In 1893, Peirce restated most of it for a less advanced audience.Peirce (1893), \"The Categories\" MS 403. Arisbe Eprint, edited by Joseph Ransdell, with information on the re-write, and interleaved with the 1867 \"New List\" for comparison. \n\nAesthetics and ethics\nPeirce did not write extensively in aesthetics and ethics,\"Charles S. Peirce on Esthetics and Ethics: A Bibliography \" (PDF) by Kelly A. Parker in 1999. but came by 1902 to hold that aesthetics, ethics, and logic, in that order, comprise the normative sciences.Peirce (1902 MS), Carnegie Application, edited by Joseph Ransdell, Memoir 2, see table. He characterized aesthetics as the study of the good (grasped as the admirable), and thus of the ends governing all conduct and thought.See Esthetics at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce.\n\nPhilosophy: logic, or semiotic\n\nLogic as philosophical\nPeirce regarded logic per se as a division of philosophy, as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,Peirce (1899 MS), \"F.R.L.\" [First Rule of Logic], Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.135\u201340, Eprint and as \"the art of devising methods of research\".Peirce (1882), \"Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic\" delivered September 1882, Johns Hopkins University Circulars, v. 2, n. 19, pp. 11\u201312 (via Google), November 1882.

More generally, as inference, \"logic is rooted in the social principle\", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.Peirce (1878), \"The Doctrine of Chances\", Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 604\u201315 (CP 2.645\u201368, Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 3:276\u201390, The Essential Peirce, 1:142\u2013154).  Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) \"mathematics of logic\" much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply \"logic\". He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.\n\nPeirce argued that logic is formal semiotic, the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that \"all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs\",Peirce, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.448 footnote, from \"The Basis of Pragmaticism\" in 1906. along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signsPeirce, (1868), \"Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man\", Journal of Speculative Philosophy v. 2, n. 2, pp. 103\u201314.

He divided logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or universal rhetoric, or methodeutic, the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.\n\nPresuppositions of logic\nIn his \"F.R.L.\" [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and \"in one sense, the sole\", rule of reason is that, to learn, one needs to desire to learn and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think. So, the first rule is, to wonder. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:\n...there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:\nDo not block the way of inquiry.\nPeirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that \"the one unpardonable offence\" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which \"metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted\". Peirce in many writings holds that logic precedes metaphysics (ontological, religious, and physical).\n\nPeirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of fallibilism, which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real (tychism and synechism).\n\nThe First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough (see below). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.Peirce (1902), The Carnegie Institute Application, Memoir 10, MS L75.361\u201362, Arisbe Eprint.\n\nFour incapacities\nThe Journal of Speculative Philosophy series (1868\u20131869), including\n Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man (1868)\n Some Consequences of Four Incapacities (1868)\n Grounds of Validity of the Laws of Logic: Further Consequences of Four Incapacities (1869) In three articles in 1868\u20131869,Peirce (1868), \"Some Consequences of Four Incapacities\", Journal of Speculative Philosophy v. 2, n. 3, pp. 140\u201357.

Peirce rejected mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt and first or ultimate principles, and argued that we have (as he numbered them):\n No power of Introspection. All knowledge of the internal world comes by hypothetical reasoning from known external facts.\n No power of Intuition (cognition without logical determination by previous cognitions). No cognitive stage is absolutely first in a process. All mental action has the form of inference.\n No power of thinking without signs. A cognition must be interpreted in a subsequent cognition in order to be a cognition at all.\n No conception of the absolutely incognizable.\n(The above sense of the term \"intuition\" is almost Kant's, said Peirce. It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)\n\nPeirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning, and the falsity of philosophical Cartesianism (see below).\n\nPeirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself and later said that to \"dismiss make-believes\" is a prerequisite for pragmatism.Peirce (1905), \"What Pragmatism Is\", The Monist, v. XV, n. 2, pp. 161\u201381, see 167. Reprinted Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.411\u201337, see 416. Arisbe Eprint.\n\nLogic as formal semiotic\nPeirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods. Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in Aristotle's work, in such loci as: the basic terminology of psychology in On the Soul; the founding description of sign relations in On Interpretation; and the differentiation of inference into three modes that are commonly translated into English as abduction, deduction, and induction, in the Prior Analytics, as well as inference by analogy (called paradeigma by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.\n\nPeirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both semiotic and semeiotic. Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic sign relation, and defined semiosis as \"action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of three subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs\".Peirce 1907, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.484. Reprinted, The Essential Peirce, 2:411 in \"Pragmatism\" (398\u2013433). As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse: \"To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.\"\n\nPeirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where sign is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or quasi-mind, that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or beesSee \"Quasi-mind\" in Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce.\u2014the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued).\n\nInquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:\n\n Conditions for meaningfulness. Study of significatory elements and combinations, their grammar.\n Validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various separate modes.\n Conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.\n\nPeirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:\n\nSigns\n \nA list of noted writings by Peirce on signs and sign relations is at Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce \u00a7 References and further reading.\n\nSign relation\nPeirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign\u2014not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The sign relation is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its object, and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its interpretant (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible triadic relation, according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.\n\nExtension \u00d7 intension = information. Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of extension (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of intension (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of information, including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.Peirce (1867), \"Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension\" (CP 2.391\u2013426), (Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 2:70\u201386). For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.\n\nDetermination. A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object\u2014the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object\u2014an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something as a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experienceSee pp. 404\u201309 in \"Pragmatism\" in The Essential Peirce, 2. Ten quotes on collateral experience from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed here at peirce-l's Lyris archive. Note: Ransdell's quotes from Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 8.178\u201379 are also in The Essential Peirce, 2:493\u201394, which gives their date as 1909; and his quote from Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 8.183 is also in The Essential Peirce, 2:495\u201396, which gives its date as 1909. with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word \"determine\" not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of \"specializes\", bestimmt,Peirce, letter to William James, dated 1909, see The Essential Peirce, 2:492. involving variable amount, like an influence.See \"76 definitions of the sign by C.S.Peirce\", collected by Robert Marty (U. of Perpignan, France). Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination.Peirce, A Letter to Lady Welby (1908), Semiotic and Significs, pp. 80\u201381:  The object determines the sign to determine another sign\u2014the interpretant\u2014to be related to the object as the sign is related to the object, hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.\n\nSemiotic elements\nPeirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):\n A sign (or representamen)Representamen ( ) was adopted (not coined) by Peirce as his technical term for the sign as covered in his theory, in case a divergence should come to light between his theoretical version and the popular senses of the word \"sign\". He eventually stopped using \"representamen\". See The Essential Peirce, 2:272\u201373 and Semiotic and Significs p. 193, quotes in \"Representamen\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. represents, in the broadest possible sense of \"represents\". It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial\u2014a cloud might be a sign of rain for instance, or ruins the sign of ancient civilization. As Peirce sometimes put it (he defined sign at least 76 times), the sign stands for the object to the interpretant. A sign represents its object in some respect, which respect is the sign's ground.\n An object (or semiotic object) is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as Prince Hamlet.Peirce (1909), A Letter to William James, The Essential Peirce, 2:492\u2013502. Fictional object, 498. Object as universe of discourse, 492. See \"Dynamical Object\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the universe of discourse to which the partial or special object belongs. For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object either (i) is immediate to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a dynamic object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded \"as on bedrock\".See \"Immediate Object\", etc., at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce.\n An interpretant (or interpretant sign) is a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise. An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's \"predecessor\" (the interpreted sign) as a sign of the same object. An interpretant either (i) is immediate to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word's usual meaning, or (ii) is a dynamic interpretant, such as a state of agitation, or (iii) is a final or normal interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign would have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide.\nSome of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.\n\nClasses of signs\nAmong Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a trichotomy, via Peirce's three phenomenological categories: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.\n\nI. Qualisign, sinsign, legisign (also called tone, token, type, and also called potisign, actisign, famisign):On the varying terminology, look up in Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category\u2014the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a \"First\"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a \"Second\"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a \"Third\".\n\nII. Icon, index, symbol: This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object\u2014the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.\n\nIII. Rheme, dicisign, argument (also called sumisign, dicisign, suadisign, also seme, pheme, delome, and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional term, proposition, argument): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object\u2014the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.\n\nEvery sign belongs to one class or another within (I) and within (II) and within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.\n\nModes of inference\n\nBorrowing a brace of concepts from Aristotle, Peirce examined three basic modes of inference\u2014abduction, deduction, and induction\u2014in his \"critique of arguments\" or \"logic proper\". Peirce also called abduction \"retroduction\", \"presumption\", and, earliest of all, \"hypothesis\". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical syllogism Barbara (AAA), for example in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" (1878).Popular Science Monthly, v. 13, pp. 470\u201382, see 472 or the book at Wikisource. Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 2.619\u201344 [623] He does this by rearranging the rule (Barbara's major premise), the case (Barbara's minor premise), and the result (Barbara's conclusion):\n\nDeduction.\n\nRule: All the beans from this bag are white. \nCase: These beans are beans from this bag. \n Result: These beans are white.\n\nInduction.\n\nCase: These beans are [randomly selected] from this bag. \nResult: These beans are white. \n Rule: All the beans from this bag are white.\n\nHypothesis (Abduction).\n\nRule: All the beans from this bag are white. \nResult: These beans [oddly] are white. \n Case: These beans are from this bag.\n\nPeirce 1883 in \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (Studies in Logic) equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:See, under \"Abduction\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce, the following quotes:\n On correction of \"A Theory of Probable Inference\", see quotes from \"Minute Logic\", Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 2.102, c. 1902, and from the Carnegie Application (L75), 1902, Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science v. 2, pp. 1031\u201332.\n On new logical form for abduction, see quote from Harvard Lectures on Pragmatism, 1903, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.188\u201389.\nSee also Santaella, Lucia (1997) \"The Development of Peirce's Three Types of Reasoning: Abduction, Deduction, and Induction\", 6th Congress of the IASS. Eprint.\n\nThe logical form does not also cover induction, since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. \"Deduction proves that something must be; Induction shows that something actually is operative; Abduction merely suggests that something may be.\"\"Lectures on Pragmatism\", 1903, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.171. Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction.A Letter to J. H. Kehler (dated 1911), The New Elements of Mathematics v. 3, pp. 203\u201304, see in \"Retroduction\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. In his methodeutic or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing.\n\nPragmatism\n\nSome noted articles and lectures\n Illustrations of the Logic of Science (1877\u20131878): inquiry, pragmatism, statistics, inference\n The Fixation of Belief (1877)\n How to Make Our Ideas Clear (1878)\n The Doctrine of Chances (1878)\n The Probability of Induction (1878)\n The Order of Nature (1878)\n Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis (1878)\n The Harvard lectures on pragmatism (1903)\n What Pragmatism Is (1905)\n Issues of Pragmaticism (1905)\n Pragmatism (1907 MS in The Essential Peirce, 2) Peirce's recipe for pragmatic thinking, which he called pragmatism and, later, pragmaticism, is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called pragmatic maxim. Here is one of his more emphatic reiterations of it:\n\nAs a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, William James, and others in the Metaphysical Club. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as \"The Fixation of Belief\" (1877) and especially \"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\" (1878) as foundational to pragmatism.James, William (1897), The Will to Believe, see p. 124. Peirce (CP 5.11\u201312), like James (Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking, 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early John Dewey, in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.\n\nIn 1905 Peirce coined the new name pragmaticism \"for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\", saying that \"all went happily\" with James's and F.C.S. Schiller's variant uses of the old name \"pragmatism\" and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in \"literary journals, where it gets abused\". Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author Giovanni Papini's declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.See Pragmaticism#Pragmaticism's name for discussion and references.\n\nPragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series of articles. In the second one, \"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\", Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:\n Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.\n Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea \"distinct\", that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce called a likewise distinct definition \"nominal\" (CP 5.553).\n Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's conceived effects, such as fosters fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduced that which he later called the pragmatic maxim.\n\nBy way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. In clearness's second grade (the \"nominal\" grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which would be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion\u2014a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.\"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\", in Peirce (1878 April), \"The Probability of Induction\", p. 718 (via Internet Archive ) in Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 705\u201318. Reprinted in Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 2.669\u201393, Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 3:290\u2013305, The Essential Peirce, 1:155\u201369, elsewhere. Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.\n\nPeirce said that a conception's meaning consists in \"all general modes of rational conduct\" implied by \"acceptance\" of the conception\u2014that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?\u2014the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to \"vulgar\" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflectionPeirce (1902), Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.13 note 1. arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances\u2014a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.See Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.34 Eprint (in \"The Spirit of Scholasticism\"), where Peirce ascribed the success of modern science less to a novel interest in verification than to the improvement of verification.\n\nPeirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness, is part of his theory of inquiry,See Joseph Ransdell's comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, Eprint which he variously called speculative, general, formal or universal rhetoric or simply methodeutic.See rhetoric definitions at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.\n\nTheory of inquiry\n\nCritical common-sensism\nCritical common-sensism,Peirce (1905), \"Issues of Pragmaticism\", The Monist, v.

Also important: Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.497\u2013525. treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.\n\nRival methods of inquiry\nIn \"The Fixation of Belief\" (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or hyperbolic doubt, which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:\n The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) \u2013 which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.\n The method of authority \u2013 which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.\n The method of the a priori \u2013 which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of \"what is agreeable to reason\". Thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.\n The method of science \u2013 wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion, such that, unlike in the other methods, inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong (fallibilism), not only right, and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.\n\nPeirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,Peirce, \"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life\", Lecture 1 of the 1898 Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.616\u201348 in part and Reasoning and the Logic of Things, 105\u201322, reprinted in The Essential Peirce, 2:27\u201341. which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's \"first rule\" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. Scientific method excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive\u2014eventually\u2014at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth per se but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.\n\nScientific method\nInsofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: deduction from self-evident truths, or rationalism; and induction from experiential phenomena, or empiricism.\n\nBased on his critique of three modes of argument and different from either foundationalism or coherentism, Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:\n\n Active, abductive genesis of theory, with no prior assurance of truth;\n Deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications;\n Inductive testing and evaluation of the utility of the provisional theory in anticipation of future experience, in both senses: prediction and control.\n\nThereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization simpliciter, which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the scientific method was proposed as an epistemology for philosophical questions.\n\nA theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.\n\nPeirce extracted the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.\n\nAbduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components.\n\nPeirce's outline of the scientific method in \u00a7III\u2013IV of \"A Neglected Argument\"Peirce (1908), \"A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God\", published in large part, Hibbert Journal v. 7, 90\u2013112. Reprinted with an unpublished part, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 6.452\u201385, Selected Writings pp. 358\u201379, The Essential Peirce, 2:434\u201350, Peirce on Signs 260\u201378. is summarized below (except as otherwise noted). There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of critique of arguments).\n\n1. Abductive (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\".See also Nubiola, Jaime (2004), \"Il Lume Naturale: Abduction and God\", Semiotiche I/2, 91\u2013102. Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths.Peirce (c. 1906), \"PAP (Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism)\" (MS 293), The New Elements of Mathematics v. 4, pp. 319\u201320, first quote under \"Abduction\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. In 1903, Peirce called pragmatism \"the logic of abduction\".Peirce (1903), \"Pragmatism \u2013 The Logic of Abduction\", Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.195\u2013205, especially 196. Eprint. Coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testabilityPeirce, Carnegie application, MS L75.279\u201380: Memoir 27, Draft B. and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.See MS L75.329\u201330, from Draft D of Memoir 27 of Peirce's application to the Carnegie Institution:  The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of Twenty Questions), breadth, or incomplexity.Peirce, C. S., \"On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents\", The Essential Peirce, 2, see pp. 107\u201309. On Twenty Questions, see 109:  One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so the point is to expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.\n\n2. Deductive phase. Two stages:\ni. Explication. Not clearly premised, but a deductive analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible.\nii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, Euclidean in procedure. Explicit deduction of consequences of the hypothesis as predictions about evidence to be found. Corollarial or, if needed, Theorematic.\n\n3. Inductive phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real \"is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\"; in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows \"a method which, sufficiently persisted in\", will \"diminish the error below any predesignate degree\". Three stages:\ni. Classification. Not clearly premised, but an inductive classing of objects of experience under general ideas.\nii. Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation. Crude or Gradual in procedure. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 7.114\u201320). Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of S, S is found actually accompanied by P that was predicted for S (CP 2.758). It depends on measurements, or statistics, or counting.\niii. Sentential Induction. \"...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result\".\n\nAgainst Cartesianism\nPeirce drew on the methodological implications of the four incapacities\u2014no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable\u2014to attack philosophical Cartesianism, of which he said that:\n\n1. \"It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt\" \u2013 when, instead, we start with preconceptions, \"prejudices [...] which it does not occur to us can be questioned\", though we may find reason to question them later. \"Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts.\"\n\n2. \"It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is...in the individual consciousness\" \u2013 when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left. No lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophy's multi-generational dream. When \"candid and disciplined minds\" continue to disagree on a theoretical issue, even the theory's author should feel doubts about it.\n\n3. It trusts to \"a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses\" \u2013 when, instead, philosophy should, \"like the successful sciences\", proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to \"the multitude and variety of its arguments\" as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but \"a cable whose fibers\", soever \"slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected\".\n\n4. It renders many facts \"absolutely inexplicable, unless to say that 'God makes them so' is to be regarded as an explanation\"Peirce believed in God. See section #Philosophy: metaphysics. \u2013 when, instead, philosophy should avoid being \"unidealistic\",However, Peirce disagreed with Hegelian absolute idealism. See for example Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 8.131. misbelieving that something real can defy or evade all possible ideas, and supposing, inevitably, \"some absolutely inexplicable, unanalyzable ultimate\", which explanatory surmise explains nothing and so is inadmissible.\n\nPhilosophy: metaphysics\nSome noted articles\n The Monist Metaphysical Series (1891\u20131893)\n The Architecture of Theories (1891)\n The Doctrine of Necessity Examined (1892)\n The Law of Mind (1892)\n Man's Glassy Essence (1892)\n Evolutionary Love (1893)\n Immortality in the Light of Synechism (1893 MS)\nPeirce divided metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) psychical or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics.\n\nOntology. Peirce was a Scholastic Realist, declaring for the reality of generals as early as 1868.Peirce (1868), \"Nominalism versus Realism\", Journal of Speculative Philosophy v. 2, n. 1, pp. 57\u201361. Reprinted (CP 6.619\u201324), (Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 2:144\u201353). Regarding modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.), he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are. In his 1897 \"The Logic of Relatives\" he wrote:  Peirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they would behave under certain circumstances.On developments in Peirce's realism, see:\n Peirce (1897), \"The Logic of Relatives\", The Monist v.

Peirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits\u2014and it is a belief in God not as an actual or existent being (in Peirce's sense of those words), but all the same as a real being.Peirce in his 1906 \"Answers to Questions concerning my Belief in God\", Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 6.495, Eprint , reprinted in part as \"The Concept of God\" in Philosophical Writings of Peirce, J. Buchler, ed., 1940, pp. 375\u201378:  In \"A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God\" (1908), Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will \"stand or fall with the hypothesis\"; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an \"infinitely incomprehensible\" being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be more false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is freeSee his \"The Doctrine of Necessity Examined\" (1892) and \"Reply to the Necessitarians\" (1893), to both of which editor Paul Carus responded. and (see Synechism) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality.\n\nPhysical metaphysics. Peirce held the view, which he called objective idealism, that \"matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws\".Peirce (1891), \"The Architecture of Theories\", The Monist v. 1, pp. 161\u201376, see p. 170, via Internet Archive. Reprinted (CP 6.7\u201334) and (The Essential Peirce, 1:285\u201397, see p. 293). Peirce asserted the reality of (1) absolute chance (his tychist view), (2) mechanical necessity (anancist view), and (3) that which he called the law of love (agapist view), echoing his categories Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called \"sporting\"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called \"tychasm\", \"anancasm\", and \"agapasm\")See \"tychism\", \"tychasm\", \"tychasticism\", and the rest, at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in Lamarckian evolution; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity,Peirce (1893), \"Evolutionary Love\", The Monist v. 3, pp. 176\u2013200.

Arisbe Eprint  especially of space, time, and law.See p. 115 in Reasoning and the Logic of Things (Peirce's 1898 lectures).\n\nScience of review\n\nPeirce outlined two fields, \"Cenoscopy\" and \"Science of Review\", both of which he called philosophy. Both included philosophy about science.  In 1903 he arranged them, from more to less theoretically basic, thus:\n\n Science of Discovery.\n Mathematics.\n Cenoscopy (philosophy as discussed earlier in this article \u2013 categorial, normative, metaphysical), as First Philosophy, concerns positive phenomena in general, does not rely on findings from special sciences, and includes the general study of inquiry and scientific method.\n Idioscopy, or the Special Sciences (of nature and mind).\n Science of Review, as Ultimate Philosophy, arranges \"...the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science\". His examples included Humboldt's Cosmos, Comte's Philosophie positive, and Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy.\n Practical Science, or the Arts.\n\nPeirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time.\n\nSee also\n\n Charles Sanders Peirce's type\u2013token distinction\n Continuous predicate\n Entitative graph\n Hypostatic abstraction\n Idea#Charles Sanders Peirce\n Laws of Form\n List of American philosophers\n Logic of information\n Logical machine\n Logical matrix\n Mathematical psychology\n Normal distribution#Naming\n Peirce triangle\n Peirce's law\n Peircean realism\n Phaneron\n Pragmatics\n Problem of universals#Peirce\n Quantification (science)#History\n Relation algebra\n Truth table\n\nContemporaries associated with Peirce\n\n Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\n Howland will forgery trial\n Allan Marquand\n George Herbert Mead\n Ventura de los Reyes Pr\u00f3sper\n Thorstein Veblen\n\n References \n\nExternal links\n\n Arisbe: The Peirce Gateway, Joseph Ransdell, ed.

{"title": "Church's thesis (constructive mathematics)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%27s_thesis_%28constructive_mathematics%29", "text": "In constructive mathematics, Church's thesis (CT) is an axiom stating that all total functions are computable.  The axiom takes its name from the Church\u2013Turing thesis, which states that every effectively calculable function is a computable function, but the constructivist version is much stronger, claiming that every function is computable.\n\nThe axiom CT is incompatible with classical logic in sufficiently strong systems. For example, Heyting arithmetic (HA) with CT as an addition axiom is able to disprove some instances of the law of the excluded middle. However, Heyting arithmetic is equiconsistent with Peano arithmetic (PA) as well as with Heyting arithmetic plus Church's thesis. That is, adding either the law of the excluded middle or Church's thesis does not make Heyting arithmetic inconsistent, but adding both does.\n\nFormal statement\nIn first-order theories such as HA, which cannot quantify over functions directly, CT is stated as an axiom schema saying that any definable function is computable, using Kleene's T predicate to define computability. For each formula \u03c6(x,y) of two variables, the schema includes the axiom\n\nThis axiom asserts that, if for every x there is a y satisfying \u03c6 then there is in fact an e that is the G\u00f6del number of a general recursive function that will, for every x, produce such a y satisfying the formula, with some u being a G\u00f6del number encoding a verifiable computation bearing witness to the fact that y is in fact the value of that function at x.\n\nIn higher-order systems that can quantify over functions directly, CT can be stated as a single axiom saying that every function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers is computable.\n\nRelationship to classical logic\nThe schema form of CT shown above, when added to constructive systems such as HA, implies the negation of the law of the excluded middle. As an example, it is a classical tautology that every Turing machine either halts or does not halt on a given input. Assuming this tautology, in sufficiently strong systems such as HA it is possible to form a function h that takes a code for a Turing machine and returns 1 if the machine halts and 0 if it does not halt. Then, from Church's Thesis one would conclude that this function is itself computable, but this is known to be false, because the Halting problem is not computably solvable. Thus HA and CT disproves some consequence of the law of the excluded middle.\n\nThe \"single axiom\" form of CT mentioned above, \n,\nquantifies over functions and says that every function f is computable (with an index e). This axiom is consistent with some weak classical systems that do not have the strength to form functions such as the function f of the previous paragraph. For example, the weak classical system  is consistent with this single axiom, because  has a model in which every function is computable. However, the single-axiom form becomes inconsistent with the law of the excluded middle in any system that has sufficient axioms to construct functions such as the function h in the previous paragraph.\n\nExtended Church's thesis\nExtended Church's thesis (ECT) extends the claim to functions which are totally defined over a certain type of domain. It is used by the school of constructive mathematics founded by Andrey Markov Jr. It can be formally stated by the schema:\n\nIn the above,  is restricted to be almost-negative. For first-order arithmetic (where the schema is designated ), this means  cannot contain any disjunction, and existential quantifiers can only appear in front of  (decidable) formulas.\n\nThis thesis can be characterised as saying that a sentence is true if and only if it is computably realisable. In fact this is captured by the following meta-theoretic equivalences:Troelstra, A. S. Metamathematical investigation of intuitionistic arithmetic and analysis. Vol 344 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics; Springer, 1973\n\nHere,  stands for \"\". So, it is provable in  with  that a sentence is true iff it is realisable. But also,  is  true in  with  iff  is  realisable in  without .\n\nThe second equivalence can be extended with Markov's principle (M) as follows:\n\nSo,  is  true in  with  and  iff there is a number n which  realises  in . The existential quantifier has to be outside  in this case, because PA is non-constructive and lacks the existence property.\n\nReferences\n\nElliott Mendelson (1990) \"Second Thoughts About Church's Thesis and Mathematical Proofs\", Journal of Philosophy 87(5): 225-233.\n\nCategory:Constructivism (mathematics)"}
{"title": "Compactness theorem", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem", "text": "In mathematical logic, the compactness theorem states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. This theorem is an important tool in model theory, as it provides a useful method for constructing models of any set of sentences that is finitely consistent.\n\nThe compactness theorem for the propositional calculus is a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem (which says that the product of compact spaces is compact) applied to compact Stone spacesSee Truss (1997)., hence the theorem's name. Likewise, it is analogous to the finite intersection property characterization of compactness in topological spaces: a collection of closed sets in a compact space has a non-empty intersection if every finite subcollection has a non-empty intersection.\n\nThe compactness theorem is one of the two key properties, along with the downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, that is used in Lindstr\u00f6m's theorem to characterize first-order logic. Although there are some generalizations of the compactness theorem to  non-first-order logics, the compactness theorem itself does not hold in them.\n\nHistory\nKurt G\u00f6del proved the countable compactness theorem in 1930.  Anatoly Maltsev proved the uncountable case in 1936.Vaught, Robert L.: \"Alfred Tarski's work in model theory\". Journal of Symbolic Logic 51 (1986), no. 4, 869\u2013882Robinson, A.: Non-standard analysis. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam 1966. page 48.\n\n Applications \n\nThe compactness theorem has many applications in model theory; a few typical results are sketched here.\n\nThe compactness theorem implies Robinson's principle: If a first-order sentence holds in every field of characteristic zero, then there exists a constant p such that the sentence holds for every field of characteristic larger than p. This can be seen as follows: suppose \u03c6 is a sentence that holds in every field of characteristic zero. Then its negation \u00ac\u03c6, together with the field axioms and the infinite sequence of sentences 1+1\u00a0\u2260\u00a00, 1+1+1\u00a0\u2260\u00a00, \u2026, is not satisfiable (because there is no field of characteristic 0 in which \u00ac\u03c6 holds, and the infinite sequence of sentences ensures any model would be a field of characteristic 0). Therefore, there is a finite subset A of these sentences that is not satisfiable. We can assume that A contains \u00ac\u03c6, the field axioms, and, for some k, the first k sentences of the form 1+1+...+1\u00a0\u2260\u00a00 (because adding more sentences doesn't change unsatisfiability). Let B contain all the sentences of A except \u00ac\u03c6. Then any field with a characteristic greater than k is a model of B, and \u00ac\u03c6 together with B is not satisfiable. This means that \u03c6 must hold in every model of B, which means precisely that \u03c6 holds in every field of characteristic greater than k.\n\nA second application of the compactness theorem shows that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models, or a single infinite model, has models of arbitrary large cardinality (this is the Upward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem). So, for instance, there are nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic with uncountably many 'natural numbers'.  To achieve this, let T be the initial theory and let \u03ba be any cardinal number. Add to the language of T one constant symbol for every element of \u03ba. Then add to T a collection of sentences that say that the objects denoted by any two distinct constant symbols from the new collection are distinct (this is a collection of \u03ba2 sentences). Since every finite subset of this new theory is satisfiable by a sufficiently large finite model of T, or by any infinite model, the entire extended theory is satisfiable. But any model of the extended theory has cardinality at least \u03ba\n\nA third application of the compactness theorem is the construction of nonstandard models of the real numbers, that is, consistent extensions of the theory of the real numbers that contain \"infinitesimal\" numbers.  To see this, let \u03a3 be a first-order axiomatization of the theory of the real numbers.  Consider the theory obtained by adding a new constant symbol \u03b5 to the language and adjoining to \u03a3 the axiom \u03b5\u00a0>\u00a00 and the axioms \u03b5\u00a0<\u00a01/n for all positive integers n.  Clearly, the standard real numbers R are a model for every finite subset of these axioms, because the real numbers satisfy everything in \u03a3 and, by suitable choice of \u03b5, can be made to satisfy any finite subset of the axioms about \u03b5.  By the compactness theorem, there is a model *R that satisfies \u03a3 and also contains an infinitesimal element \u03b5.  A similar argument, adjoining axioms \u03c9\u00a0>\u00a00, \u03c9\u00a0>\u00a01, etc., shows that the existence of infinitely large integers cannot be ruled out by any axiomatization \u03a3 of the reals.\n\n Proofs \n\nOne can prove the compactness theorem using G\u00f6del's completeness theorem, which establishes that a set of sentences is satisfiable if and only if no contradiction can be proven from it.  Since proofs are always finite and therefore involve only finitely many of the given sentences, the compactness theorem follows.  In fact, the compactness theorem is equivalent to G\u00f6del's completeness theorem, and both are equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weak form of the axiom of choice.See Hodges (1993).\n\nG\u00f6del originally proved the compactness theorem in just this way, but later some \"purely semantic\" proofs of the compactness  theorem were found, i.e., proofs that refer to truth but not to provability.  One of those proofs relies on ultraproducts hinging on the axiom of choice as follows:\n\nProof:  Fix a first-order language L, and let \u03a3  be a collection of L-sentences such that every finite subcollection of L-sentences, i\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\u03a3 of it has a model .  Also let  be the direct product of the structures and I be the collection of  finite subsets of \u03a3.   For each i in I let \nAi := { j \u2208 I : j \u2287 i}.\nThe family of all of these sets Ai generates a proper filter, so there is an ultrafilter U containing all sets of the form Ai.\n\nNow for any formula \u03c6 in \u03a3 we have:\n the set A{\u03c6} is in U\n whenever j\u00a0\u2208\u00a0A{\u03c6}, then \u03c6\u00a0\u2208\u00a0j, hence \u03c6 holds in  \n the set of all j with the property that \u03c6 holds in   is a superset of A{\u03c6}, hence also in U\nUsing \u0141o\u015b's theorem we see that \u03c6 holds in the ultraproduct .  So this ultraproduct satisfies all formulas in \u03a3.\n\nSee also\n\n List of Boolean algebra topics\n L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem\n Herbrand's theorem\n Barwise compactness theorem\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCategory:Model theory\nCategory:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics\nCategory:Metatheorems"}

{"title": "Computability logic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_logic", "text": "Computability logic (CoL) is a research program and mathematical framework for redeveloping logic as a systematic formal theory of computability, as opposed to classical logic which is a formal theory of truth. It was introduced and so named by Giorgi Japaridze in 2003. G. Japaridze,    Introduction to computability logic. Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 123 (2003), pages 1\u201399. \n\nIn classical logic, formulas represent true/false statements. In CoL, formulas represent computational problems. In classical logic, the validity of a formula depends only on its form, not on its meaning. In CoL, validity means being always computable. More generally, classical logic tells us when the truth of a given statement always follows from the truth of a given set of other statements. Similarly, CoL tells us when the computability of a given problem  A always follows from the computability of other given problems B1,\u2026,Bn. Moreover, it provides a uniform way to actually construct a solution (algorithm) for such an A from any known solutions of B1,\u2026,Bn.\n\nCoL formulates computational problems in their most general \u2013 interactive sense. CoL defines a computational problem as a game played by a machine against its environment. Such problem is computable if there is a machine that wins the game against every possible behavior of the environment. Such game-playing machine generalizes the Church-Turing thesis to the interactive level. The classical concept of truth turns out to be a special, zero-interactivity-degree case of computability. This makes classical logic a special fragment of CoL. Thus CoL is a conservative extension of classical logic. Computability logic is more expressive, constructive and computationally meaningful than classical logic. Besides classical logic, independence-friendly (IF) logic  and certain proper extensions of linear logic and intuitionistic logic also turn out to be natural fragments of CoL.G. Japaridze, In the beginning was game semantics.   Games: Unifying Logic, Language and Philosophy. O. Majer, A.-V. Pietarinen and T. Tulenheimo, eds. Springer 2009, pp.\u00a0249\u2013350. PrepublicationG. Japaridze, The intuitionistic fragment of computability logic at the propositional level. Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 147 (2007), pages 187\u2013227. Hence meaningful concepts of \"intuitionistic truth\", \"linear-logic truth\" and \"IF-logic truth\" can be derived from the semantics of CoL.\n\nCoL systematically answers the fundamental question of what can be computed and how; thus CoL has many applications, such as constructive applied theories, knowledge base systems, systems for planning and action. Out of these, only applications in constructive applied theories have been extensively explored so far: a series of CoL-based number theories, termed \"clarithmetics\", have been constructedG.

This has necessitated developing alternative, more general and flexible methods of proof, such as cirquent calculus.G. Japaridze,  Introduction to cirquent calculus and abstract resource semantics.

Prepublication\n\nLanguage \nthumb|Operators of computability logic: names, symbols and readings The full language of CoL extends the language of classical first-order logic. Its logical vocabulary has several sorts of conjunctions, disjunctions, quantifiers, implications, negations and so called recurrence operators. This collection includes  all connectives and quantifiers of classical logic. The language also has two sorts of nonlogical atoms: elementary and general. Elementary atoms, which are nothing but the atoms of classical logic, represent elementary problems, i.e., games with no moves that are automatically won by the machine when true and lost when false. General atoms, on the other hand, can be interpreted as any games, elementary or non-elementary. Both semantically and syntactically, classical logic is nothing but the fragment of CoL obtained by forbidding general atoms in its language, and forbidding all operators other than \u00ac, \u2227, \u2228, \u2192, \u2200, \u2203.\n\nJaparidze has repeatedly pointed out that the language of CoL is open-ended, and may undergo further extensions. Due to the expressiveness of this language, advances in CoL, such as constructing axiomatizations or building CoL-based applied theories, have usually been limited to one or another proper fragment of the language.\n\nSemantics \nThe games underlying the semantics of CoL are called static games. Such games have no turn order; a player can always move while the other players are \"thinking\". However, static games never punishes a player for \"thinking\" too long (delaying its own moves), so such games never become contests of speed. All elementary games are automatically static, and so are the games allowed to be interpretations of general atoms.\n\nThere are two players in static games: the machine and the environment. The machine can only follow algorithmic strategies, while there are no restrictions on the behavior of the environment. Each run (play) is won by one of these players and lost by the other.\n\nThe logical operators of CoL are understood as operations on games. Here we informally survey some of those operations. For simplicity we assume that the domain of discourse is always the set of all natural numbers: {0,1,2,\u2026}. \n\nThe operation \u00ac of negation (\"not\") switches the roles of the two players, turning moves and wins by the machine into those by the environment, and vice versa. For instance, if Chess is the game of chess (but with ties ruled out) from the white player\u2019s perspective, then \u00acChess is the same game from the black player\u2019s perspective. \n\nThe parallel conjunction \u2227 (\"pand\")  and parallel disjunction \u2228 (\"por\") combine games in a parallel fashion. A run of A\u2227B or A\u2228B is a simultaneous play in the two conjuncts. The machine wins A\u2227B if it wins both of them. The machine wins A\u2228B if it wins at least one of them. For example, Chess\u2228\u00acChess is a game on two boards, one played white and one black, and where the task of the machine is to win on at least one board. Such a game can be easily won regardless who the adversary is, by copying his moves from one board to the other.\n\nThe parallel implication operator \u2192 (\"pimplication\") is defined by A\u2192B = \u00acA\u2228B. The intuitive meaning of this operation is reducing B to A, i.e., solving A as long as the adversary solves B.\n\nThe parallel quantifiers \u2227 (\"pall\") and \u2228 (\"pexists\") can be defined by \u2227xA(x) = A(0)\u2227A(1)\u2227A(2)\u2227...  and  \u2228xA(x) = A(0)\u2228A(1)\u2228A(2)\u2228.... These are thus simultaneous plays of A(0),A(1),A(2),\u2026, each on a separate board. The machine wins \u2227xA(x) (resp. \u2228xA(x)) if it wins all (resp. some) of these games.\n\nThe blind quantifiers \u2200 (\"blall\") and \u2203 (\"blexists\"), on the other hand, generate single-board games. A run of \u2200xA(x) or \u2203xA(x) is a single run of A. The machine wins \u2200xA(x) (resp. \u2203xA(x)) if such a run is a won run of A(x) for all (resp. at least one) possible values of x. \n\nAll of the operators characterized so far behave exactly like their classical counterparts when they are applied to elementary (moveless) games, and validate the same principles. This is why CoL uses the same symbols for those operators as classical logic does. When such operators are applied to non-elementary games, however, their behavior is no longer classical. So, for instance, if p is an elementary atom and P a general atom, p\u2192p\u2227p is valid while P\u2192P\u2227P is not. The principle of the excluded middle P\u2228\u00acP, however, remains valid. The same principle is invalid with all three other sorts (choice, sequential and toggling) of disjunction.\n\nThe choice disjunction  \u2294 (\"chor\") of games A and B, written A\u2294B, is a game where, in order to win, the machine has to choose one of the two disjuncts and then win in the chosen component. The sequential disjunction (\"sor\") A\u1401B starts as A; it also ends as A unless the machine makes a \"switch\" move, in which case A is abandoned and the game restarts and continues as B. In the toggling disjunction (\"tor\") A\u2a5bB, the machine may switch between A and B any finite number of times. Each disjunction operator has its dual conjunction, obtained by interchanging the roles of the two players. The corresponding quantifiers can further be defined as infinite conjunctions or disjunctions in the same way as in the case of the parallel quantifiers. Each sort disjunction also induces a corresponding implication operation the same way as this was the case with the parallel implication \u2192. For instance, the choice implication (\"chimplication\") A\u2290B is defined as \u00acA\u2294B. \n\nThe parallel recurrence (\"precurrence\") of A can be defined as the infinite parallel conjunction A\u2227A\u2227A\u2227... The sequential (\"srecurrence\") and toggling (\"trecurrence\") sorts of recurrences can be defined similarly.\n\nThe corecurrence operators can be defined as infinite disjunctions. Branching recurrence (\"brecurrence\") \u2af0, which is the strongest sort of recurrence, does not have a corresponding conjunction. \u2af0A is a game that starts and proceeds as A. At any time, however, the environment is allowed to make a \"replicative\" move, which creates two copies of the then-current position of A, thus splitting the play into two parallel threads with a common past but possibly different future developments. In the same fashion, the environment can further replicate any of positions of any thread, thus creating more and more threads of A. Those threads are played in parallel, and the machine needs to win A in all threads to be the winner in \u2af0A. Branching corecurrence (\"cobrecurrence\") \u2aef is defined symmetrically by interchanging \"machine\" and \"environment\". \n\nEach sort of recurrence further induces a corresponding weak version of implication and weak version of negation. The former is said to be a rimplication, and the latter a refutation. The branching rimplication (\"brimplication\") A\u27dcB is nothing but \u2af0A\u2192B, and the branching refutation (\"brefutation\") of A is A\u27dc\u22a5, where \u22a5 is the always-lost elementary game. Similarly for all other sorts of rimplication and refutation.\n\nAs a problem specification tool \nThe language of CoL offers a systematic way to specify an infinite variety of computational problems, with or without names established in the literature. Below are some examples. \n\nLet f be a unary function. The problem of computing f will be written as \u2293x\u2294y(y=f(x)). According to the semantics of CoL, this is a game where the first move (\"input\") is by the environment, which should choose a value m for x. Intuitively, this amounts to asking the machine to tell the value of f(m). The game continues as \u2294y(y=f(m)). Now the machine is expected to make a move (\"output\"), which should be choosing a value n for y. This amounts to saying that n is the value of f(m). The game is now brought down to the elementary n=f(m), which is won by the machine if and only if n is indeed the value of f(m). \n\nLet p be a unary predicate. Then \u2293x(p(x)\u2294\u00acp(x)) expresses the problem of deciding p, \u2293x(p(x)&\u1401\u00acp(x)) expresses the problem of semideciding p, and \u2293x(p(x)\u2a5b\u00acp(x)) the problem of recursively approximating p. \n\nLet p and q be two unary predicates. Then  \u2293x(p(x)\u2294\u00acp(x))\u27dc\u2293x(q(x)\u2294\u00acq(x)) expresses the problem of Turing-reducing q to p (in the sense that q is Turing reducible to p if and only if the interactive problem  \u2293x(p(x)\u2294\u00acp(x))\u27dc\u2293x(q(x)\u2294\u00acq(x)) is computable).   \u2293x(p(x)\u2294\u00acp(x))\u2192\u2293x(q(x)\u2294\u00acq(x)) does the same but for the stronger version of Turing reduction where the oracle for p can be queried only once. \u2293x\u2294y(q(x)\u2194p(y)) does the same for the problem of many-one reducing q to p. With more complex expressions one can capture all kinds of nameless yet potentially meaningful relations and operations on computational problems, such as, for instance, \"Turing-reducing the problem of semideciding r to the problem of many-one reducing q to p\". Imposing time or space restrictions on the work of the machine, one further gets complexity-theoretic counterparts of such relations and operations.\n\nAs a problem solving tool \nThe known deductive systems for various fragments of CoL share the property that a solution (algorithm) can be automatically extracted from a proof of a problem in the system. This property is further inherited by all applied theories based on those systems.  So, in order to find a solution for a given problem, it is sufficient to express it in the language of CoL and then find a proof of that expression. Another way to look at this phenomenon is to think of a formula G of CoL as program specification (goal). Then a proof of G is \u2013 more precisely, translates into \u2013 a program meeting that specification. There is no need to verify that the specification is met, because the proof itself is, in fact, such a verification. \n\nExamples of CoL-based applied theories are the so-called clarithmetics. These are number theories based on CoL in the same sense as Peano arithmetic PA is based on classical logic. Such a system is usually a conservative extension of PA. It typically includes all Peano axioms, and adds to them one or two extra-Peano axioms such as \u2293x\u2294y(y=x''') expressing the computability of the successor function. Typically it also has one or two non-logical rules of inference, such as constructive versions of induction or comprehension. Through routine variations in such rules one can obtain sound and complete systems characterizing one or another interactive computational complexity class C. This is in the sense that a problem belongs to C if and only if it has a proof in the theory. So, such a theory can be used for finding not merely algorithmic solutions, but also efficient ones on demand, such as solutions that run in polynomial time or logarithmic space. It should be pointed out that all claritmetical theories share the same logical postulates, and only their non-logical postulates vary depending on the target complexity class. Their notable distinguishing feature from other approaches with similar aspirations (such as bounded arithmetic) is that they extend rather than weaken PA, preserving the full deductive power and convenience of the latter.\n\nLiterature\nM.

{"title": "Consistency", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency", "text": "In classical deductive logic, a consistent theory is one that does not entail a contradiction.Tarski 1946 states it this way: \"A deductive theory is called CONSISTENT or NON-CONTRADICTORY if no two asserted statements of this theory contradict each other, or in other words, if of any two contradictory sentences . . . at least one cannot be proved,\" (p. 135) where Tarski defines contradictory as follows: \"With the help of the word not one forms the NEGATION of any sentence; two sentences, of which the first is a negation of the second, are called CONTRADICTORY SENTENCES\" (p. 20). This definition requires a notion of \"proof\". G\u00f6del in his 1931 defines the notion this way: \"The class of provable formulas is defined to be the smallest class of formulas that contains the axioms and is closed under the relation \"immediate consequence\", i.e., formula c of a and b is defined as an immediate consequence in terms of modus ponens or substitution; cf G\u00f6del 1931 van Heijenoort 1967:601. Tarski defines \"proof\" informally as \"statements follow one another in a definite order according to certain principles . . . and accompanied by considerations intended to establish their validity[true conclusion for all true premises -- Reichenbach 1947:68]\" cf Tarski 1946:3. Kleene 1952 defines the notion with respect to either an induction or as to paraphrase) a finite sequence of formulas such that each formula in the sequence is either an axiom or an \"immediate consequence\" of the preceding formulas; \"A proof is said to be a proof of its last formula, and this formula is said to be (formally) provable or be a (formal) theorem\" cf Kleene 1952:83.see Paraconsistent logic The lack of contradiction can be defined in either semantic or syntactic terms. The semantic definition states that a theory is consistent if it has a model, i.e., there exists an interpretation under which all formulas in the theory are true. This is the sense used in traditional Aristotelian logic, although in contemporary mathematical logic the term satisfiable is used instead. The syntactic definition states a theory  is consistent if there is no formula  such that both  and its negation  are elements of the set of consequences of . Let  be a set of closed sentences (informally \"axioms\") and  the set of closed sentences provable from  under some (specified, possibly implicitly) formal deductive system. The set of axioms  is consistent when  for no formula .Let  be a signature,  a theory in  and  a sentence in . We say that  is a consequence of , or that  entails , in symbols , if every model of  is a model of . (In particular if  has no models then  entails .)\n\nWarning: we don't require that if  then there is a proof of  from . In any case, with infinitary languages it's not always clear what would constitute a proof. Some writers use  to mean that  is deducible from  in some particular formal proof calculus, and they write  for our notion of entailment (a notation which clashes with our ). For first-order logic the two kinds of entailment coincide by the completeness theorem for the proof calculus in question.\nWe say that  is valid, or is a logical theorem, in symbols , if  is true in every -structure. We say that  is consistent if  is true in some -structure. Likewise we say that a theory  is consistent if it has a model.\nWe say that two theories S and T in L infinity omega are equivalent if they have the same models, i.e. if Mod(S) = Mod(T). (Please note definition of Mod(T) on p. 30 ...) \n\nA Shorter Model Theory by Wilfrid Hodges, p. 37\n\nIf there exists a deductive system for which these semantic and syntactic definitions are equivalent for any theory formulated in a particular deductive logic, the logic is called complete. The completeness of the sentential calculus was proved by Paul Bernays in 1918van Heijenoort 1967:265 states that Bernays determined the independence of the axioms of Principia Mathematica, a result not published until 1926, but he says nothing about Bernays proving their consistency. and Emil Post in 1921,Post proves both consistency and completeness of the propositional calculus of PM, cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Post's 1931 Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions in van Heijenoort 1967:264ff. Also Tarski 1946:134ff. while the completeness of predicate calculus was proved by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1930,cf van Heijenoort's commentary and G\u00f6del's 1930 The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic in van Heijenoort 1967:582ff and consistency proofs for arithmetics restricted with respect to the induction axiom schema were proved by Ackermann (1924), von Neumann (1927) and Herbrand (1931).cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Herbrand's 1930 On the consistency of arithmetic in van Heijenoort 1967:618ff. Stronger logics, such as second-order logic, are not complete.\n\nA consistency proof is a mathematical proof that a particular theory is consistent.Informally, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory is ordinarily assumed; some dialects of informal mathematics customarily assume the axiom of choice in addition. The early development of mathematical proof theory was driven by the desire to provide finitary consistency proofs for all of mathematics as part of Hilbert's program.  Hilbert's program was strongly impacted by incompleteness theorems, which showed that sufficiently strong proof theories cannot prove their own consistency (provided that they are in fact consistent).\n\nAlthough consistency can be proved by means of model theory, it is often done in a purely syntactical way, without any need to reference some model of the logic. The cut-elimination (or equivalently the normalization of the underlying calculus if there is one) implies the consistency of the calculus: since there is no cut-free proof of falsity, there is no contradiction in general.\n\nConsistency and completeness in arithmetic and set theory\nIn theories of arithmetic, such as Peano arithmetic, there is an intricate relationship between the consistency of the theory and its completeness. A theory is complete if, for every formula \u03c6 in its language, at least one of \u03c6 or \u00ac\u03c6 is a logical consequence of the theory.\n\nPresburger arithmetic is an axiom system for the natural numbers under addition. It is both consistent and complete.\n\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems show that any sufficiently strong recursively enumerable theory of arithmetic cannot be both complete and consistent. G\u00f6del's theorem applies to the theories of Peano arithmetic (PA) and primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA), but not to Presburger arithmetic.\n\nMoreover, G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem shows that the consistency of sufficiently strong recursively enumerable theories of arithmetic can be tested in a particular way. Such a theory is consistent if and only if it does not prove a particular sentence, called the G\u00f6del sentence of the theory, which is a formalized statement of the claim that the theory is indeed consistent. Thus the consistency of a sufficiently strong, recursively enumerable, consistent theory of arithmetic can never be proven in that system itself. The same result is true for recursively enumerable theories that can describe a strong enough fragment of arithmetic\u2014including set theories such as Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.  These set theories cannot prove their own G\u00f6del sentence\u2014provided that they are consistent, which is generally believed.\n\nBecause consistency of ZF is not provable in ZF, the weaker notion  is interesting in set theory (and in other sufficiently expressive axiomatic systems). If T is a theory and A is an additional axiom, T + A is said to be consistent relative to T (or simply that A is consistent with T) if it can be proved that\nif T is consistent then T + A is consistent. If both A and \u00acA are consistent with T, then A is said to be independent of T.\n\n First-order logic \n\nNotation\n (Turnstile symbol) in the following context of mathematical logic, means \"provable from\". That is,  reads: b is provable from a (in some specified formal system). See List of logic symbols. In other cases, the turnstile symbol may mean implies; permits the derivation of. See: List of mathematical symbols.\n\nDefinition\nA set of formulas  in first-order logic is consistent (written ) if there is no formula  such that  and .

Finally,  can be verified by induction on formulas.\n\n Model theory \n\nIn ZFC set theory with classical first-order logic,the common case in many applications to other areas of mathematics as well as the ordinary mode of reasoning of informal mathematics in calculus and applications to physics, chemistry, engineering an inconsistent theory  is one such that there exists a closed sentence  such that  contains both  and its negation .

{"title": "Diagonal lemma", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma", "text": "In mathematical logic, the diagonal lemma  (also known as diagonalization lemma, self-reference lemma or fixed point theorem) establishes the existence of self-referential sentences in certain formal theories of the natural numbers\u2014specifically those theories that are strong enough to represent all computable functions. The sentences whose existence is secured by the diagonal lemma can then, in turn, be used to prove fundamental limitative results such as  G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems and Tarski's undefinability theorem.See Boolos and Jeffrey (2002, sec. 15) and Mendelson (1997, Prop.\u00a03.37 and Cor.\u00a03.44 ).\n\n Background \nLet N be the set of natural numbers. A theory T represents the computable function f : N\u2192N if there exists a \"graph\" predicate \u0393f(x,y) in the language of T such that for each x in N, T proves\n .For details on representability, see Hinman 2005, p.\u00a0316\nHere \u00b0x is the numeral corresponding to the natural number x, which is defined to be the closed term 1+ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 +1 (x ones), and \u00b0f(x) is the numeral corresponding to f(x).\n\nThe diagonal lemma also requires that there be a systematic way of assigning to every formula \u03b8 a natural number #(\u03b8) called its G\u00f6del number. Formulas can then be represented within the theory by the numerals corresponding to their G\u00f6del numbers. For example, \u03b8 is represented by \u00b0#(\u03b8)\n\nThe diagonal lemma applies to theories capable of representing all primitive recursive functions. Such theories include Peano arithmetic and the weaker Robinson arithmetic. A common statement of the lemma (as given below) makes the stronger assumption that the theory can represent all computable functions.\n\n Statement of the lemma \nLet T be a first-order theory in the language of arithmetic and capable of representing all computable functions. Let F be a formula in the language with one free variable, then:\n\nIntuitively, \u03c8 is a self-referential sentence saying that \u03c8 has the property F. The sentence \u03c8 can also be viewed as a fixed point of the operation assigning to each formula \u03b8 the sentence F(\u00b0#(\u03b8)). The sentence \u03c8 constructed in the proof is not literally the same as F(\u00b0#(\u03c8)), but is provably equivalent to it in the theory\u00a0T.\n\nProof\nLet f: N\u2192N be the function defined by:\nf(#(\u03b8)) = #(\u03b8(\u00b0#(\u03b8)))\nfor each T-formula \u03b8 in one free variable, and f(n) = 0 otherwise. The function f is computable, so there is a formula \u0393f representing f in T. Thus for each formula \u03b8, T proves\n(\u2200y) [\u0393f(\u00b0#(\u03b8),y) \u2194 y = \u00b0f(#(\u03b8))],\nwhich is to say\n(\u2200y) [\u0393f(\u00b0#(\u03b8),y) \u2194 y = \u00b0#(\u03b8(\u00b0#(\u03b8)))].\nNow define the formula \u03b2(z) as:\n\u03b2(z) = (\u2200y) [\u0393f(z,y) \u2192 F(y)].\nThen T proves\n\u03b2(\u00b0#(\u03b8)) \u2194 (\u2200y) [ y = \u00b0#(\u03b8(\u00b0#(\u03b8))) \u2192 F(y)],\nwhich is to say\n\u03b2(\u00b0#(\u03b8)) \u2194 F(\u00b0#(\u03b8(\u00b0#(\u03b8)))).\nNow take \u03b8 = \u03b2 and \u03c8 = \u03b2(\u00b0#(\u03b2)), and the previous sentence rewrites to \u03c8\u00a0\u2194\u00a0F(\u00b0#(\u03c8)), which is the desired result.\n\n(The same argument in different terms is given in [Raatikainen (2015a)].)\n\nHistory\nThe diagonal lemma is closely related to Kleene's recursion theorem in computability theory, and their respective proofs are similar.\n\nThe lemma is called \"diagonal\" because it bears some resemblance to Cantor's diagonal argument.See, for example, Gaifman (2006). The terms \"diagonal lemma\" or \"fixed point\" do not appear in Kurt G\u00f6del's 1931 article, or in Tarski (1936). Carnap (1934) was the first to prove that for any formula F in a theory T satisfying certain conditions, there exists a formula \u03c8 such that \u03c8\u00a0\u2194\u00a0F(\u00b0#(\u03c8)) is provable in T. Carnap's work was phrased in alternate language, as the concept of  computable functions was not yet developed in 1934. Mendelson (1997, p.\u00a0204) believes that Carnap was the first to state that something like the diagonal lemma was implicit in G\u00f6del's reasoning. G\u00f6del was aware of Carnap's work by 1937.See G\u00f6del's Collected Works, Vol. 1, p. 363, fn 23.\n\nSee also\nIndirect self-reference\nList of fixed point theorems\nPrimitive recursive arithmetic\nSelf-reference\nSelf\u2013referential paradoxes\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n George Boolos and Richard Jeffrey, 1989.

{"title": "Division by zero", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero", "text": "thumb|alt= Graph showing the diagrammatic representation of limits approaching infinity|The function y\u00a0=\u00a01/x. As x approaches 0 from the right, y approaches infinity. As x approaches 0 from the left, y approaches negative infinity.\n\nIn mathematics, division by zero is division where the divisor (denominator) is zero. Such a division can be formally expressed as  where a is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, when multiplied by 0, gives a (assuming a\u00a0\u2260\u00a00), and so division by zero is undefined. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression  is also undefined; when it is the form of a limit, it is an indeterminate form. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to  is contained in George Berkeley's criticism of infinitesimal calculus in 1734 in The Analyst (\"ghosts of departed quantities\")..\n\nThere are mathematical structures in which  is defined for some a such as in the Riemann sphere and the projectively extended real line; however, such structures cannot satisfy every ordinary rule of arithmetic (the field axioms).\n\nIn computing, a program error may result from an attempt to divide by zero. Depending on the programming environment and the type of number (e.g. floating point, integer) being divided by zero, it may generate positive or negative infinity by the IEEE 754 floating point standard, generate an exception, generate an error message, cause the program to terminate, result in a special not-a-number value, a freeze via infinite loop, or a crash.\n\nElementary arithmetic\nWhen division is explained at the elementary arithmetic level, it is often considered as splitting a set of objects into equal parts. As an example, consider having ten cookies, and these cookies are to be distributed equally to five people at a table. Each person would receive  = 2 cookies. Similarly, if there are ten cookies, and only one person at the table, that person would receive  = 10 cookies.\n\nSo, for dividing by zero, what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table? Certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem. The problem with this question is the \"when\". There is no way to distribute 10 cookies to nobody. In mathematical jargon, a set of 10 items cannot be partitioned into 0 subsets. So , at least in elementary arithmetic, is said to be either meaningless, or undefined.\n\nSimilar problems occur with 0 cookies and 0 people, but this time the problem is in the phrase \"the number\". A partition is possible (of a set with 0 elements into 0 parts), but since the partition has 0 parts, vacuously every set in the partition has a given number of elements, be it 0, 2, 5, or 1000.\n\nIf there are, say, 5 cookies and 2 people, the problem is in \"evenly distribute\". In any integer partition of a 5-set into 2 parts, one of the parts of the partition will have more elements than the other. But the problem with 5 cookies and 2 people can be solved by cutting one cookie in half. The problem with 5 cookies and 0 people cannot be solved in any way that preserves the meaning of \"divides\".\n\nAnother way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication. Considering the  example above, setting x = , if x equals ten divided by zero, then x times zero equals ten, but there is no x that, when multiplied by zero, gives ten (or any number other than zero). If instead of x = , x = , then every x satisfies the question 'what number x, multiplied by zero, gives zero?'\n\nEarly attempts\nThe Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta of Brahmagupta (598\u2013668) is the earliest text to treat zero as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero. The author could not explain division by zero in his texts: his definition can be easily proven to lead to algebraic absurdities. According to Brahmagupta,\n\nA positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero.\n\nIn 830, Mah\u0101v\u012bra tried unsuccessfully to correct Brahmagupta's mistake in his book in Ganita Sara Samgraha: \"A number remains unchanged when divided by zero.\"\n\nAlgebra\n\nThe four basic operations \u2013 addition, subtraction, multiplication and division \u2013 as applied to whole numbers (positive integers), with some restrictions, in elementary arithmetic are used as a framework to support the extension of the realm of numbers to which they apply. For instance, to make it possible to subtract any whole number from another, the realm of numbers must be expanded to the entire set of integers in order to incorporate the negative integers. Similarly, to support division of any integer by any other, the realm of numbers must expand to the rational numbers. During this gradual expansion of the number system, care is taken to ensure that the \"extended operations\", when applied to the older numbers, do not produce different results. Loosely speaking, since division by zero has no meaning (is undefined) in the whole number setting, this remains true as the setting expands to the real or even complex numbers.\n\nAs the realm of numbers to which these operations can be applied expands there are also changes in how the operations are viewed. For instance, in the realm of integers, subtraction is no longer considered a basic operation since it can be replaced by addition of signed numbers. Similarly, when the realm of numbers expands to include the rational numbers, division is replaced by multiplication by certain rational numbers. In keeping with this change of viewpoint, the question, \"Why can't we divide by zero?\", becomes \"Why can't a rational number have a zero denominator?\". Answering this revised question precisely requires close examination of the definition of rational numbers.\n\nIn the modern approach to constructing the field of real numbers, the rational numbers appear as an intermediate step in the development that is founded on set theory. First, the natural numbers (including zero) are established on an axiomatic basis such as Peano's axiom system and then this is expanded to the ring of integers. The next step is to define the rational numbers keeping in mind that this must be done using only the sets and operations that have already been established, namely, addition, multiplication and the integers. Starting with the set of ordered pairs of integers, } with , define a binary relation on this set by  if and only if . This relation is shown to be an equivalence relation and its equivalence classes are then defined to be the rational numbers. It is in the formal proof that this relation is an equivalence relation that the requirement that the second coordinate is not zero is needed (for verifying transitivity).\n\nThe above explanation may be too abstract and technical for many purposes, but if one assumes the existence and properties of the rational numbers, as is commonly done in elementary mathematics, the \"reason\" that division by zero is not allowed is hidden from view. Nevertheless, a (non-rigorous) justification can be given in this setting.\n\nIt follows from the properties of the number system we are using (that is, integers, rationals, reals, etc.), if  then the equationif  this is not an equation since the left side is not a number and the right side is a number.  is equivalent to . Assuming that  is a number , then it must be that . However, the single number  would then have to be determined by the equation , but every number satisfies this equation, so we cannot assign a numerical value to .\n\nDivision as the inverse of multiplication\nThe concept that explains division in algebra is that it is the inverse of multiplication. For example, Extract of page 35\n\nsince 2 is the value for which the unknown quantity in\n\nis true. But the expression\n\nrequires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in\n\nBut any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so there is no number that solves the equation.\n\nThe expression\n\nrequires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in\n\nAgain, any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so this time every number solves the equation instead of there being a single number that can be taken as the value of 0/0.\n\nIn general, a single value can't be assigned to a fraction where the denominator is 0 so the value remains undefined.\n\nFallacies\n\nA compelling reason for not allowing division by zero is that, if it were allowed, many absurd results (i.e., fallacies) would arise. When working with numerical quantities it is easy to determine when an illegal attempt to divide by zero is being made. For example, consider the following computation.\n\nWith the assumptions:\n\nthe following is true:\n\nDividing both sides by zero gives:\n\nSimplified, this yields:\n\nThe fallacy here is the assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation with the same properties as dividing by any other number.\n\nHowever, it is possible to disguise a division by zero in an algebraic argument, leading to invalid proofs that, for instance,  such as the following:\nLet .\nMultiply by  to get\n \nSubtract  from each side to get\n\nDivide both sides by \n\nwhich simplifies to\n\nBut, since ,\n  \nThe disguised division by zero occurs since  when .\n\nCalculus\nExtended real line\n\nAt first glance it seems possible to define a/0 by considering the limit of a/b as b approaches 0.\n\nFor any positive a, the limit from the right is\n\nhowever, the limit from the left is\n\nand so the  is undefined (the limit is also undefined for negative a).\n\nFurthermore, there is no obvious definition of 0/0 that can be derived from considering the limit of a ratio. The limit\n\ndoes not exist. Limits of the form\n\nin which both \u0192(x) and g(x) approach 0 as x approaches 0, may equal any real or infinite value, or may not exist at all, depending on the particular functions \u0192 and g. These and other similar facts show that the expression 0/0 cannot be well-defined as a limit.\n\nFormal operations\nA formal calculation is one carried out using rules of arithmetic, without consideration of whether the result of the calculation is well-defined. Thus, it is sometimes useful to think of a/0, where a\u00a0\u2260\u00a00, as being . This infinity can be either positive, negative, or unsigned, depending on context. For example, formally:\n\nAs with any formal calculation, invalid results may be obtained. A logically rigorous (as opposed to formal) computation would assert only that\n\nSince the one-sided limits are different, the two-sided limit does not exist in the standard framework of the real numbers. Also, the fraction 1/0 is left undefined in the extended real line, therefore it and\n\n \n\nare meaningless expressions.\n\nProjectively extended real line\nThe set  is the projectively extended real line, which is a one-point compactification of the real line. Here  means an unsigned infinity, an infinite quantity that is neither positive nor negative. This quantity satisfies , which is necessary in this context. In this structure,  can be defined for nonzero a, and . It is the natural way to view the range of the tangent function and cotangent functions of trigonometry: tan(x) approaches the single point at infinity as x approaches either  or  from either direction.\n\nThis definition leads to many interesting results. However, the resulting algebraic structure is not a field, and should not be expected to behave like one. For example,  is undefined in this extension of the real line.\n\nRiemann sphere\nThe set  is the Riemann sphere, which is of major importance in complex analysis. Here too  is an unsigned infinity \u2013 or, as it is often called in this context, the point at infinity. This set is analogous to the projectively extended real line, except that it is based on the field of complex numbers. In the Riemann sphere, , but  is undefined, as is .\n\nExtended non-negative real number line\n\nThe negative real numbers can be discarded, and infinity introduced, leading to the set [0,\u00a0\u221e], where division by zero can be naturally defined as a/0\u00a0=\u00a0\u221e for positive\u00a0a. While this makes division defined in more cases than usual, subtraction is instead left undefined in many cases, because there are no negative numbers.\n\nHigher mathematics\nAlthough division by zero cannot be sensibly defined with real numbers and integers, it is possible to consistently define it, or similar operations, in other mathematical structures.\n\nNon-standard analysis\nIn the hyperreal numbers and the surreal numbers, division by zero is still impossible, but division by non-zero infinitesimals is possible.\n\nDistribution theory\nIn distribution theory one can extend the function  to a distribution on the whole space of real numbers (in effect by using Cauchy principal values). It does not, however, make sense to ask for a \"value\" of this distribution at x\u00a0=\u00a00; a sophisticated answer refers to the singular support of the distribution.\n\nLinear algebra\nIn matrix algebra (or linear algebra in general), one can define a pseudo-division, by setting a/b\u00a0=\u00a0ab+, in which b+ represents the pseudoinverse of b. It can be proven that if b\u22121 exists, then b+ = b\u22121. If b equals 0, then b+ = 0.\n\nAbstract algebra\nAny number system that forms a commutative ring\u2014for instance, the integers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers\u2014can be extended to a wheel in which division by zero is always possible; however, in such a case, \"division\" has a slightly different meaning.\n\nThe concepts applied to standard arithmetic are similar to those in more general algebraic structures, such as rings and fields. In a field, every nonzero element is invertible under multiplication; as above, division poses problems only when attempting to divide by zero. This is likewise true in a skew field (which for this reason is called a division ring). However, in other rings, division by nonzero elements may also pose problems. For example, the ring Z/6Z of integers mod 6. The meaning of the expression  should be the solution x of the equation . But in the ring Z/6Z, 2 is a zero divisor. This equation has two distinct solutions, x = 1 and x = 4, so the expression  is undefined.\n\nIn field theory, the expression  is only shorthand for the formal expression ab\u22121, where b\u22121 is the multiplicative inverse of b. Since the field axioms only guarantee the existence of such inverses for nonzero elements, this expression has no meaning when b is zero. Modern texts, that define fields as a special type of ring, include the axiom 0\u00a0\u2260\u00a01 for fields (or its equivalent) so that the zero ring is excluded from being a field. In the zero ring, division by zero is possible, which shows that the other field axioms are not sufficient to exclude division by zero in a field.\n\nComputer arithmetic\nthumb|Most calculators, such as this Texas Instruments TI-86, will halt execution and display an error message when the user or a running program attempts to divide by zero.\nthumb|upright|Division by zero on Android 2.2.1 calculator shows the symbol of infinity.\nThe IEEE floating-point standard, supported by almost all modern floating-point units, specifies that every floating point arithmetic operation, including division by zero, has a well-defined result. The standard supports signed zero, as well as infinity and NaN (not a number). There are two zeroes: +0 (positive zero) and \u22120 (negative zero) and this removes any ambiguity when dividing. In IEEE 754 arithmetic, a\u00a0\u00f7\u00a0+0 is positive infinity when a is positive, negative infinity when a is negative, and NaN when a\u00a0=\u00a0\u00b10. The infinity signs change when dividing by \u22120 instead.\n\nThe justification for this definition is to preserve the sign of the result in case of arithmetic underflow. For example, in the single-precision computation 1/(x/2), where x = \u00b12\u2212149, the computation x/2 underflows and produces \u00b10 with sign matching x, and the result will be \u00b1\u221e with sign matching x. The sign will match that of the exact result \u00b12150, but the magnitude of the exact result is too large to represent, so infinity is used to indicate overflow.\n\nInteger division by zero is usually handled differently from floating point since there is no integer representation for the result. Some processors generate an exception when an attempt is made to divide an integer by zero, although others will simply continue and generate an incorrect result for the division. The result depends on how division is implemented, and can either be zero, or sometimes the largest possible integer.\n\nBecause of the improper algebraic results of assigning any value to division by zero, many computer programming languages (including those used by calculators) explicitly forbid the execution of the operation and may prematurely halt a program that attempts it, sometimes reporting a \"Divide by zero\" error. In these cases, if some special behavior is desired for division by zero, the condition must be explicitly tested (for example, using an if statement). Some programs (especially those that use fixed-point arithmetic where no dedicated floating-point hardware is available) will use behavior similar to the IEEE standard, using large positive and negative numbers to approximate infinities. In some programming languages, an attempt to divide by zero results in undefined behavior. The graphical programming language Scratch 2 used in many schools returns Infinity or -Infinity depending on the sign of the dividend.\n\nIn two's complement arithmetic, attempts to divide the smallest signed integer by  are attended by similar problems, and are handled with the same range of solutions, from explicit error conditions to undefined behavior.\n\nMost calculators will either return an error or state that 1/0 is undefined; however, some TI and HP graphing calculators will evaluate (1/0)2 to \u221e.\n\nMicrosoft Math and Mathematica return ComplexInfinity for 1/0. Maple and SageMath return an error message for 1/0, and infinity for 1/0.0 (0.0 tells these systems to use floating point arithmetic instead of algebraic arithmetic).\n\n Historical accidents \n On September 21, 1997, a division by zero error in the \"Remote Data Base Manager\" aboard USS Yorktown (CG-48) brought down all the machines on the network, causing the ship's propulsion system to fail.\n\nSee also\n\n Asymptote\n Defined and undefined\n Division by Zero, a short story by Ted Chiang\n Indeterminate form\n Zero divisor\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n \n \n \n \n Patrick Suppes 1957 (1999 Dover edition), Introduction to Logic, Dover Publications, Inc., Mineola, New York.

{"title": "Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_definitions_of_mathematical_structures", "text": "In mathematics, equivalent definitions are used in two somewhat different ways. First, within a particular mathematical theory (for example, Euclidean geometry), a notion (for example, ellipse or minimal surface) may have more than one definition. These definitions are equivalent in the context of a given mathematical structure (Euclidean space, in this case). Second, a mathematical structure may have more than one definition (for example, topological space has at least seven definitions; ordered field has at least two definitions).\n\nIn the former case, equivalence of two definitions means that a mathematical object (for example, geometric body) satisfies one definition if and only if it satisfies the other definition.\n\nIn the latter case, the meaning of equivalence (between two definitions of a structure) is more complicated, since a structure is more abstract than an object. Many different objects may implement the same structure.\n\nIsomorphic implementations\n\nNatural numbers may be implemented as 0 = , 1 =  = , 2 =  = , 3 =  =  and so on; or alternatively as 0 = , 1 =  =, 2 =  =  and so on. These are two different but isomorphic implementations of natural numbers in set theory.\nThey are isomorphic as models of Peano axioms, that is, triples (N,0,S) where N is a set, 0 an element of N, and S (called the successor function) a map of N to itself (satisfying appropriate conditions). In the first implementation S(n) = n \u222a ; in the second implementation S(n) = . As emphasized in Benacerraf's identification problem, the two implementations differ in their answer to the question whether 0 \u2208 2; however, this is not a legitimate question about natural numbers (since the relation \u2208 is not stipulated by the relevant signature(s), see the next section).Technically, \"0 \u2208 2\" is an example of a non-transportable relation, see , . Similarly, different but isomorphic implementations are used for complex numbers.\n\nDeduced structures and cryptomorphisms\n\nThe successor function S on natural numbers leads to arithmetic operations, addition and multiplication, and the total order, thus endowing N with an ordered semiring structure. This is an example of a deduced structure. The ordered semiring structure (N, +, \u00b7, \u2264) is deduced from the Peano structure (N, 0, S) by the following procedure:\nn + 0 = n, \u00a0 m + S (n) = S (m + n), \u00a0 m \u00b7 0 = 0, \u00a0 m \u00b7 S (n) = m + (m \u00b7 n), and m \u2264 n if and only if there exists k \u2208 N such that m + k = n. And conversely, the Peano structure is deduced from the ordered semiring structure as follows: S (n) = n + 1, and 0 is defined by 0 + 0 = 0. It means that the two structures on N are equivalent by means of the two procedures.\n\nThe two isomorphic implementations of natural numbers, mentioned in the previous section, are isomorphic as triples (N,0,S), that is, structures of the same signature (0,S) consisting of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function S. An ordered semiring structure (N, +, \u00b7, \u2264) has another signature (+, \u00b7, \u2264) consisting of two binary functions and one binary relation. The notion of isomorphism does not apply to structures of different signatures. In particular, a Peano structure cannot be isomorphic to an ordered semiring. However, an ordered semiring deduced from a Peano structure may be isomorphic to another ordered semiring. Such relation between structures of different signatures is sometimes called a cryptomorphism.\n\nAmbient frameworks\n\nA structure may be implemented within a set theory ZFC, or another set theory such as NBG, NFU, ETCS.About ETCS see Type theory#Mathematical foundations Alternatively, a structure may be treated in the framework of first-order logic, second-order logic, higher-order logic, a type theory, homotopy type theory etc.A reasonable choice of an ambient framework should not alter basic properties of a structure, but can alter provability of finer properties. For example, some theorems about the natural numbers are provable in set theory (and some other strong systems) but not provable in first-order logic; see Paris\u2013Harrington theorem and Goodstein's theorem. The same applies to definability; see for example Tarski's undefinability theorem.\n\nStructures according to Bourbaki\n\n\"Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have.\" ()\n\n\"Evident as the notion of mathematical structure may seem these days, it was at least not made explicit until the middle of the 20th century. Then it was the influence of the Bourbaki-project and then later the development of category theory which made the notion explicit\" (nLab).\n\nAccording to Bourbaki, the scale of sets on a given set X consists of all sets arising from X by taking Cartesian products and power sets, in any combination, a finite number of times. Examples: X; X \u00d7 X; P(X); P(P(X \u00d7 X) \u00d7 X \u00d7 P(P(X))) \u00d7 X. (Here A \u00d7 B is the product of A and B, and P(A) is the powerset of A.) In particular, a pair (0,S) consisting of an element 0 \u2208 N and a unary function S : N \u2192 N belongs to N \u00d7 P(N \u00d7 N) (since a function is a subset of the Cartesian product). A triple (+, \u00b7, \u2264) consisting of two binary functions N \u00d7 N \u2192 N and one binary relation on N belongs to P(N \u00d7 N \u00d7 N)  \u00d7 P(N \u00d7 N \u00d7 N)  \u00d7 P(N \u00d7 N). Similarly, every algebraic structure on a set belongs to the corresponding set in the scale of sets on X.\n\nNon-algebraic structures on a set X often involve sets of subsets of X (that is, subsets of P(X), in other words, elements of P(P(X))). For example, the structure of a topological space, called a topology on X, treated as the set of \"open\" sets; or the structure of a measurable space, treated as the \u03c3-algebra of \"measurable\" sets; both are elements of P(P(X)). These are second-order structures.\n\nMore complicated non-algebraic structures combine an algebraic component and a non-algebraic component. For example, the structure of a topological group consists of a topology and the structure of a group. Thus it belongs to the product of P(P(X)) and another (\"algebraic\") set in the scale; this product is again a set in the scale.\n\nTransport of structures; isomorphism\n\nGiven two sets X, Y and a bijection f : X \u2192 Y, one constructs the corresponding bijections between scale sets. Namely, the bijection X \u00d7 X \u2192 Y \u00d7 Y sends (x1,x2) to (f(x1),f(x2)); the bijection P(X) \u2192 P(Y) sends a subset A of X into its image f(A) in Y; and so on, recursively: a scale set being either product of scale sets or power set of a scale set, one of the two constructions applies.\n\nLet (X,U) and (Y,V) be two structures of the same signature. Then U belongs to a scale set SX, and V belongs to the corresponding scale set SY. Using the bijection F : SX \u2192 SY constructed from a bijection f : X \u2192 Y, one defines:\n f is an isomorphism between (X,U) and (Y,V) if F(U) = V.\nThis general notion of isomorphism generalizes many less general notions listed below.\n For algebraic structures: isomorphism is a bijective homomorphism.\n In particular, for vector spaces: linear bijection.\n For partially ordered sets: order isomorphism.\n For graphs: graph isomorphism.\n More generally, for sets endowed with a binary relation: relation-preserving isomorphism.\n For topological spaces: homeomorphism or topological isomorphism or bi continuous function.\n For uniform spaces: uniform isomorphism.\n For metric spaces: bijective isometry.\n For topological groups: group isomorphism which is also a homeomorphism of the underlying topological spaces.\n For topological vector spaces: isomorphism of vector spaces which is also a homeomorphism of the underlying topological spaces.\n For Banach spaces: bijective linear isometry.\n For Hilbert spaces: unitary transformation.\n For Lie groups: a bijective smooth group homomorphism whose inverse is also a smooth group homomorphism.\n For smooth manifolds: diffeomorphism.\n For symplectic manifolds: symplectomorphism.\n For Riemannian manifolds: isometric diffeomorphism.\n For conformal spaces: conformal diffeomorphism.\n For probability spaces: a bijective measurable and measure preserving map whose inverse is also measurable and measure preserving.\n For affine spaces: bijective affine transformation.\n For projective spaces: homography.\nIn fact, Bourbaki stipulates two additional features. First, several sets X1, ..., Xn (so-called principal base sets) may be used, rather than a single set X. However, this feature is of little use. All the items listed above use a single principal base set. Second, so-called auxiliary base sets E1, ..., Em may be used. This feature is widely used. Indeed, the structure of a vector space stipulates not only addition X \u00d7 X \u2192 X but also scalar multiplication R \u00d7 X \u2192 X (if R is the field of scalars). Thus, R is an auxiliary base set (called also \"external\"). The scale of sets consists of all sets arising from all base sets (both principal and auxiliary) by taking Cartesian products and power sets. Still, the map f (possibly an isomorphism) acts on X only; auxiliary sets are endowed by identity maps. (However, the case of n principal sets leads to n maps.)\n\nFunctoriality\n\nSeveral statements formulated by Bourbaki without mentioning categories can be reformulated readily in the language of category theory. First, some terminology. \n The scale of sets is indexed by \"echelon construction schemes\", called also \"types\". One may think of, say, the set P(P(X \u00d7 X) \u00d7 X \u00d7 P(P(X))) \u00d7 X as a set X substituted into the formula \"P(P(a \u00d7 a) \u00d7 a \u00d7 P(P(a))) \u00d7 a\" for the variable a; this formula is the corresponding echelon construction scheme.In order to be more formal, Bourbaki encodes such formulas with sequences of ordered pairs of natural numbers. (This notion, defined for all structures, may be thought of as a generalization of the signature defined only for algebraic structures.)On one hand, it is possible to exclude the Cartesian products, treating a pair (x,y) as just the set {{x},{x,y}}. On the other hand, it is possible to include the set operation X,Y->YX (all functions from X to Y). \"It is possible to simplify the matter by considering operations and functions as a special kind of relations (for example, a binary operation is a ternary relation). However, quite often, it is an advantage to have operations as a primitive concept.\"  \n Let Set* denote the groupoid of sets and bijections. That is, the category whose objects are (all) sets, and morphisms are (all) bijections.\n\nProposition.  Each echelon construction scheme leads to a functor from Set* to itself.\n\nIn particular, the permutation group of a set X acts on every scale set SX.\n\nIn order to formulate one more proposition, the notion \"species of structures\" is needed, since echelon construction scheme gives only preliminary information on a structure. For example, commutative groups and (arbitrary) groups are two different species of the same echelon construction scheme. Another example: topological spaces and measurable spaces. They differ in the so-called axiom of the species. This axiom is the conjunction of all required properties, such as \"multiplication is associative\" for groups, or \"the union of open sets is an open set\" for topological spaces.\n A species of structures consists of an echelon construction scheme and an axiom of the species.\n\nProposition.  Each species of structures leads to a functor from Set* to itself.\n\nExample. For the species of groups, the functor F maps a set X to the set F(X) of all group structures on X. For the species of topological spaces, the functor F maps a set X to the set F(X) of all topologies on X. The morphism F(f) : F(X) \u2192 F(Y) corresponding to a bijection f : X \u2192 Y is the transport of structures. Topologies on Y correspond bijectively to topologies on X. The same holds for group structures, etc.\n\nIn particular, the set of all structures of a given species on a given set is invariant under the action of the permutation group on the corresponding scale set SX, and is a fixed point of the action of the group on another scale set P(SX). However, not all fixed points of this action correspond to species of structures.The set of all possible axioms of species is countable, while the set of all fixed points of the considered action may be uncountable. Tarski's \"logical notions of higher order\" are closer to the fixed points than to species of structures, see  and references therefrom.\n\nGiven two species, Bourbaki defines the notion \"procedure of deduction\" (of a structure of the second species from a structure of the first species). A pair of mutually inverse procedures of deduction leads to the notion \"equivalent species\".\n\nExample. The structure of a topological space may be defined as an open set topology or alternatively, a closed set topology. The two corresponding procedures of deduction coincide; each one replaces all given subsets of X with their complements. In this sense, these are two equivalent species.\n\nIn the general definition of Bourbaki, deduction procedure may include a change of the principal base set(s), but this case is not treated here. In the language of category theory one have the following result.\n\nProposition.  Equivalence between two species of structures leads to a natural isomorphism between the corresponding functors.\n\nHowever, in general, not all natural isomorphisms between these functors correspond to equivalences between the species.The set of all possible deduction procedures is countable, while the set of all natural isomorphisms between the considered functors may be uncountable (see an example in Section #Canonical, not just natural).\n\nMathematical practice\n\n\"We often do not distinguish structures that are isomorphic and often say that two structures are the same, up to isomorphism.\"\n\"When studying structures we are interested only in their form, but when we prove their existence we need to construct them.\"\n\n'Mathematicians are of course used to identifying isomorphic structures in practice, but they generally do so by \"abuse of notation\", or some other informal device, knowing that the objects involved are not \"really\" identical.' (A radically better approach is expected; but for now, Summer 2014, the definitive book quoted above does not elaborate on structures.)\n\nIn practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures.\n\nUsually, a text based on natural numbers (for example, the article \"prime number\") does not specify the used definition of natural numbers. Likewise, a text based on topological spaces (for example, the article \"homotopy\", or \"inductive dimension\") does not specify the used definition of a topological space. Thus, it is possible (and rather probable) that the reader and the author interpret the text differently, according to different definitions. Nevertheless, the communication is successful, which means that such different definitions may be thought of as equivalent.\n\nA person acquainted with topological spaces knows basic relations between neighborhoods, convergence, continuity, boundary, closure, interior, open sets, closed sets, and does not need to know that some of these notions are \"primary\", stipulated in the definition of a topological space, while others are \"secondary\", characterized in terms of \"primary\" notions. Moreover, knowing that subsets of a topological space are themselves topological spaces, as well as products of topological spaces, the person is able to construct some new topological spaces irrespective of the definition.\n\nThus, in practice a topology on a set is treated like an abstract data type that provides all needed notions (and constructors) but hides the distinction between \"primary\" and \"secondary\" notions. The same applies to other kinds of mathematical structures. \"Interestingly, the formalization of structures in set theory is a similar task as the formalization of structures for computers.\"\n\nCanonical, not just natural\n\nAs was mentioned, equivalence between two species of structures leads to a natural isomorphism between the corresponding functors. However, \"natural\" does not mean \"canonical\". A natural transformation is generally non-unique.\n\nExample. Consider again the two equivalent structures for natural numbers. One is the \"Peano structure\" (0,S), the other is the structure (+, \u00b7, \u2264) of ordered semiring. If a set X is endowed by both structures then, on one hand, X =  where S(an) = an+1 for all n and 0 = a0; and on the other hand, X =  where bm+n = bm + bn, bm\u00b7n = bm \u00b7 bn, and bm  \u2264bn if and only if m \u2264 n. Requiring that an = bn for all n one gets the canonical equivalence between the two structures. However, one may also require a0 = b1, a1 = b0, and an = bn for all n > 1, thus getting another, non-canonical, natural isomorphism. Moreover, every permutation of the index set  leads to a natural isomorphism; they are uncountably many!\n\nAnother example. A structure of a (simple) graph on a set V =  of vertices may be described by means of its adjacency matrix, a (0,1)-matrix of size n\u00d7n (with zeros on the diagonal). More generally, for arbitrary V an adjacency function on V \u00d7 V may be used. The canonical equivalence is given by the rule: \"1\" means \"connected\" (with an edge), \"0\" means \"not connected\". However, another rule, \"0\" means \"connected\", \"1\" means \"not\", may be used, and leads to another, natural but not canonical, equivalence. In this example, canonicity is rather a matter of convention. But here is a worse case. Instead of \"0\" and \"1\" one may use, say, the two possible orientations of the plane R2 (\"clockwise\" and \"counterclockwise\"). It is difficult to choose a canonical rule in this case!\n\n\"Natural\" is a well-defined mathematical notion, but it does not ensure uniqueness. \"Canonical\" does, but generally is more or less conventional. A consistent choice of canonical equivalences is an inevitable component of equivalent definitions of mathematical structures.\n\nSee also\n\n Structure (category theory)\n Concrete category\n Abuse of terminology#Equality vs. isomorphism\n Equivalence of categories\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n.\n.\n\nFurther reading\n.\n.\n.\n\nExternal links\n nLab:structured set \"Almost everything in contemporary mathematics is an example of a structured set.\" (quoted from Section \"Examples\") \n nLab: structure in model theory\n nLab: stuff, structure, property\n MathOverflow: What is the definition of \u201ccanonical\u201d? \"a rule of thumb: there is a canonical isomorphism between X and Y if and only if you would feel comfortable writing X = Y\" (Reid Barton)\n Abstract Math:Mathematical structures \"When you think of a structure it is best to think of it as containing all that information, not just the stuff in the definition\" (Charles Wells)\n MathStackExchange: A pedantic question about defining new structures in a path-independent way `We would continue making statements like, \"A topological space is determined by its open sets,\" but would never make a statement like, \"A topological space is an ordered pair  such that...\"'\n MathStackExchange: Does there exist another way of obtaining a topological space from a metric space equally deserving of the term \u201ccanonical\u201d?\n\nCategory:Mathematical structures\nCategory:Equivalence (mathematics)"}

He later moved to the Academy of Art Dresden where he met Adrian Ludwig Richter. Like many artists of his time, he visited Italy, with extended stays in Naples and Venice.KLEUDGEN vov FRIEDERICH\n\nIn 1873 he arrived in Bordighera with his wife and stayed at the Pensione Calvauna, which later became Coffee Cadama, until 1884. In the city he found a small German community and fascinated by the climate and light, decided to settle in the Ligurian town. In 1885 he built his home just outside the walls of old Bordighera, near the port of Magdalena and the old cemetery. The house, which he named \"Villa Banana\", and that is on the 4th of Via dei Colli, still exists today but unfortunately it was turned into an apartment building and is in poor conditions.[Bordighera published yesterday by city Bordighera in 1996]\n\nIn 1891 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Pudmensky. They had three children: Frieda, William (mountaineer who died in 1929) and Luise who died in 1898. The only surviving child was Baroness Frieda von Kleudgen Peano, who in 1971 wrote a book on her father's life, \"My father\". The daughter remembers that on the terrace of the house in the summer evenings, von Kleudgen often fiddled with bordigotti friends including the painter and Mayor GF Piana. The father loved the simple life of the village and often spoke with fishermen returning from the Bay dell'Arziglia.\n\nWhat fascinated him was the sea, which he painted in numerous paintings. His paintings portray him now calm, now stormy, conveying the full force of nature. His most famous paintings are the \"fish's Nest\" and the \"Sea Serpent\" which can be seen at the Bicknell Museum. Some of his paintings are on display at the Town hall of Bordighera but the majority is in private collections.Storia: Federico Von Kleudgen Another subject he liked to paint were the paths of Bordighera.Federico Von Keudgen\n\nHe also had close ties of friendship with numerous bordigotti of different welfare states and represented them in his paintings. He was a friends of the other painters and artists who lived in Bordighera as Pompeo Mariani, Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana, Hermann Nestel, Charles Garnier and of course Ludwig Winter.\n\nIn 1884 Claude Monet portrayed him while he painted a window of Villa Garnier. Kleudgen reproduced in a series of watercolors the bordigotti he liked so much.

{"title": "Giovanni Vailati", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Vailati", "text": "Giovanni Vailati (24 April 1863 \u2013 14 May 1909) was an Italian proto-analytic philosopher, historian of science, and mathematician.\n\n Life \nVailati was born in Crema, Lombardy, and studied engineering at the University of Turin. He went on to lecture in the history of mechanics there from 1896 to 1899, after working as assistant to Giuseppe Peano and Vito Volterra. He resigned his university post in 1899 so that he could pursue his independent studies, making a living from high-school mathematics teaching. During his lifetime he became internationally known, his writings having been translated into English, French, and Polish, though he was largely forgotten after his death in Rome. He was rediscovered in the late 1950s. He did not publish any complete books, but left about 200 essays and reviews across a range of academic disciplines.\n\n Philosophy \nVailati's view of philosophy was that it provided a preparation and the tools for scientific work. For that reason, and because philosophy should be neutral between rival beliefs, conceptions, theoretical structures, etc., the philosopher should avoid the use of special technical language, but should use the language that he finds used in those areas in which he is interested. That is not to say that the philosopher should merely accept whatever he finds; an ordinary-language term may be problematic, but its deficiencies should be corrected rather than replacing it with some new technical term.\n\nHis view of truth and meaning was influenced by philosophers such as C.S. Peirce and Ernst Mach. He carefully distinguished between meaning and truth: \"the question of determining what we mean when we propound a given proposition is entirely different from the question of deciding whether it is true or false.Scritti, 187 Nevertheless, having decided what is meant, the work of deciding whether it is true or false is crucial. Vailati held a moderate positivist view, in both science and philosophy:\n\n\"it must be demanded of anybody who advances a thesis that he be capable of indicating the facts which according to him should obtain (or have obtained) if his thesis were true, and also their difference from other facts which according to him would obtain (or have obtained) if it were not true\"Scritti, 166\n\nVailati's influences and contacts were many and varied, belying the oversimple label often attached to him: \"the Italian pragmatist\". While owing much to Peirce and William James (between whose thought he was one of the first to distinguish), he also acknowledged the influence of Plato and George Berkeley (both of whom he saw as important precursors of, or influences on, pragmatism), Gottfried Leibniz, Victoria Welby-Gregory G.E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, Peano, and Franz Brentano. He corresponded with many of his contemporaries.\n\nHis early work included papers on symbolic logic, focusing on its r\u00f4le in philosophy, and distinguishing between logic and psychology and epistemology.\n\n History of science \nVailata's main historical interests concerned mechanics, logic, and geometry, and he was an important contributor to a number of areas, including the study of post-Aristotelian Greek mechanics, of Galileo's predecessors, of the notion and r\u00f4le of definition in the work of Plato and Euclid, of mathematical influences on logic and epistemology, and of the non-Euclidean geometry of Gerolamo Saccheri. He was particularly interested in the ways in which what might be seen as the same problems are addressed and dealt with at different times.\n\nHis historical work was interrelated with his philosophical work, involving the same fundamental views and methodology. Vailati saw the two as differing in approach rather than subject matter, and believed that there should be co-operation between philosophers and scientists in the pursuit of historical studies. He also held that a complete history demanded that one take into account the relevant social background.\n\nOf a certain interest is the participation of Vailati in the scientific activity of the chair of \"Calculus infinitesimal\" held by Giuseppe Peano. We are in Turin in 1892. The period is full of Prolusions and there are the emergence of disciplines such as anthropology and sociology, which have produced a new scientific concept in the nineteenth century (see Antonio Santucci, Pragmatism in Italy, Bologna, Il Mulino, 1963, p 157 and sg.  [BNI] 63-8109) The Turin Prolusions (1896-1898) open the horizon to new discoveries and to the formulations of scientific theories and hypotheses concerning the relationship between science and its history. In this context are the famous \"questions of words\", which concern language and its functioning as a means of transmitting ideas (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, Giovanni Vailati. Storia e metodologia delle scienze and Giuseppe Peano, Giovanni Vailati. Contributi invisibili, idem Una epistemologia senza storia, Rome, Nuova Cultura, 2013, ).\n\t\n\nThe superseding of scientific theories and other results doesn't involve their destruction, for their importance is increased by their being superseded: \"Every error shows us a rock to be avoided, while not every discovery shows us a path to be followed.Scritti, 4\n\nNotes\n\n Sources \n Giovanni Vailati (1972) Scritti filosofici.\n \n Ivor Grattan-Guinness (2000) The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870\u20131940, Princeton University Press.\n Ferruccio Rossi-Landi (1967) \"Giovanni Vailati\", in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", ed.

{"title": "Hermann Grassmann", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Grassmann", "text": "Hermann G\u00fcnther Grassmann (; 15 April 1809 \u2013 26 September 1877) was a German polymath, known in his day as a linguist and now also as a mathematician. He was also a physicist,  neohumanist, general scholar, and publisher. His mathematical work was little noted until he was in his sixties.\n\nBiography\nGrassmann was the third of 12 children of Justus G\u00fcnter Grassmann, an ordained minister who taught mathematics and physics at the Stettin Gymnasium, where Hermann was educated.\n\nGrassmann was an undistinguished student until he obtained a high mark on the examinations for admission to Prussian universities. Beginning in 1827, he studied theology at the University of Berlin, also taking classes in classical languages, philosophy, and literature. He does not appear to have taken courses in mathematics or physics.\n\nAlthough lacking university training in mathematics, it was the field that most interested him when he returned to Stettin in 1830 after completing his studies in Berlin. After a year of preparation, he sat the examinations needed to teach mathematics in a gymnasium, but achieved a result good enough to allow him to teach only at the lower levels. Around this time, he made his first significant mathematical discoveries, ones that led him to the important ideas he set out in his 1844 paper referred to  as A1 (see references).\n\nIn 1834 Grassmann began teaching mathematics at the Gewerbeschule in Berlin. A year later, he returned to Stettin to teach mathematics, physics, German, Latin, and religious studies at a new school, the Otto Schule. Over the next four years, Grassmann passed examinations enabling him to teach mathematics, physics, chemistry, and mineralogy at all secondary school levels.\n\nIn 1847, he was made an \"Oberlehrer\" or head teacher. In 1852, he was appointed to his late father's position at the Stettin Gymnasium, thereby acquiring the title of Professor. In 1847, he asked the Prussian Ministry of Education to be considered for a university position, whereupon that Ministry asked Kummer for his opinion of Grassmann. Kummer wrote back saying that Grassmann's 1846 prize essay (see below) contained \"... commendably good material expressed in a deficient form.\" Kummer's report ended any chance that Grassmann might obtain a university post. This episode proved the norm; time and again, leading figures of Grassmann's day failed to recognize the value of his mathematics.\n\nStarting during the political turmoil in Germany, 1848\u201349, Hermann and his brother Robert published a Stettin newspaper, Deutsche Wochenschrift f\u00fcr Staat, Kirche und Volksleben, calling for German unification under a constitutional monarchy. (This eventuated in 1871.) After writing a series of articles on constitutional law, Hermann parted company with the newspaper, finding himself increasingly at odds with its political direction.\n\nGrassmann had eleven children, seven of whom reached adulthood. A son, Hermann Ernst Grassmann, became a professor of mathematics at the University of Giessen.\n\nMathematician\nOne of the many examinations for which Grassmann sat required that he submit an essay on the theory of the tides. In 1840, he did so, taking the basic theory from Laplace's M\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste and from Lagrange's M\u00e9canique analytique, but expositing this theory making use of the vector methods he had been mulling over since 1832. This essay, first published in the Collected Works of 1894\u20131911, contains the first known appearance of what is now called linear algebra and the notion of a vector space. He went on to develop those methods in his A1 and A2 (see bibliography).\n\nIn 1844, Grassmann published his masterpiece, his Die Lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der MathematikTr. The rulers extension theory, a new branch of mathematics [The Theory of Linear Extension, a New Branch of Mathematics], hereinafter denoted A1 and commonly referred to as the Ausdehnungslehre,Tr. Expansion plan teachings which translates as \"theory of extension\" or \"theory of extensive magnitudes.\" Since A1 proposed a new foundation for all of mathematics, the work began with quite general definitions of a philosophical nature. Grassmann then showed that once geometry is put into the algebraic form he advocated, the number three has no privileged role as the number of spatial dimensions; the number of possible dimensions is in fact unbounded.\n\nFearnley-Sander (1979)] describes Grassmann's foundation of linear algebra  as follows:Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra\n\nFollowing an idea of Grassmann's father, A1 also defined the exterior product, also called \"combinatorial product\" (in German: \u00e4u\u00dferes ProduktTr. outer product or kombinatorisches ProduktTr. combinatorial product), the key operation of an algebra now called exterior algebra. (One should keep in mind that in Grassmann's day, the only axiomatic theory was Euclidean geometry, and the general notion of an abstract algebra had yet to be defined.) In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford joined this exterior algebra to William Rowan Hamilton's quaternions by replacing Grassmann's rule epep = 0 by the rule epep = 1. (For quaternions, we have the rule i2 = j2 = k2 = \u22121.) For more details, see exterior algebra.\n\nA1 was a revolutionary text, too far ahead of its time to be appreciated. When Grassmann submitted it to apply for a professorship in 1847, the ministry asked Ernst Kummer for a report. Kummer assured that there were good ideas in it, but found the exposition deficient and advised against giving Grassmann a university position. Over the next 10-odd years, Grassmann wrote a variety of work applying his theory of extension, including his 1845 Neue Theorie der ElektrodynamikTr. New theory of electrodynamics and several papers on algebraic curves and surfaces, in the hope that these applications would lead others to take his theory seriously.\n\nIn 1846, M\u00f6bius invited Grassmann to enter a competition to solve a problem first proposed by Leibniz: to devise a geometric calculus devoid of coordinates and metric properties (what Leibniz termed analysis situs). Grassmann's Geometrische Analyse gekn\u00fcpft an die von Leibniz erfundene geometrische Charakteristik,Tr. Geometric analysis linked to the geometric characteristics invented by Leibniz was the winning entry (also the only entry). M\u00f6bius, as one of the judges, criticized the way Grassmann introduced abstract notions without giving the reader any intuition as to why those notions were of value.\n\nIn 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; it and its three color laws are still taught, as Grassmann's law. Grassmann's work on this subject was inconsistent with that of Helmholtz. Grassmann also wrote on crystallography, electromagnetism, and mechanics.\n\nGrassmann (1861) set out the first axiomatic presentation of arithmetic, making free use of the principle of induction. Peano and his followers cited this work freely starting around 1890. Lloyd C. Kannenberg published an English translation of The Ausdehnungslehre and Other works in 1995 (. -- ).\n\nIn 1862, Grassmann published a thoroughly rewritten second edition of A1, hoping to earn belated recognition for his theory of extension, and containing the definitive exposition of his linear algebra. The result, Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollst\u00e4ndig und in strenger Form bearbeitet [The Theory of Extension, Thoroughly and Rigorously Treated], hereinafter denoted A2, fared no better than A1, even though A2's manner of exposition anticipates the textbooks of the 20th century.\n\nResponse\nIn 1840s, mathematicians were generally unprepared to understand Grassmann's ideas. In the 1860s and 1870s various mathematicians came to ideas similar to that of Grassmann's, but Grassmann himself was not interested in mathematics anymore.\n\nOne of the first mathematicians to appreciate Grassmann's ideas during his lifetime was Hermann Hankel, whose 1867 Theorie der complexen Zahlensysteme\n... developed some of Hermann Grassmann's algebras and Hamilton's quaternions. Hankel was the first to recognise the significance of Grassmann's long-neglected writings ...Hankel entry in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography. New York: 1970\u20131990\n\nIn 1872 Victor Schlegel published the first part of his System der Raumlehre which used Grassmann's approach to derive ancient and modern results in plane geometry. Felix Klein wrote a negative review of Schlegel's book citing its incompleteness and lack of perspective on Grassmann. Schlegel followed in 1875 with a second part of his System according to Grassmann, this time developing higher geometry. Meanwhile, Klein was advancing his Erlangen Program which also expanded the scope of geometry.Rowe 2010\n\nComprehension of Grassmann awaited the concept of vector spaces which then could express the multilinear algebra of his extension theory.  To establish the priority of Grassmann over Hamilton, Josiah Willard Gibbs urged Grassmann's heirs to have the 1840 essay on tides published.Lynde Wheeler (1951), Josiah Willard Gibbs:  The History of a Great Mind, 1998 reprint, Woodbridge, CT:  Ox Bow, pp. 113-116.  A. N. Whitehead's first monograph, the Universal Algebra (1898), included the first systematic exposition in English of the theory of extension and the exterior algebra. With the rise of differential geometry the exterior algebra was applied to differential forms.\n\nFor an introduction to the role of Grassmann's work in contemporary mathematical physics see The Road to RealityPenrose The Road to Reality, chapters 11 & 2 by Roger Penrose.\n\nAdh\u00e9mar Jean Claude Barr\u00e9 de Saint-Venant developed a vector calculus similar to that of Grassmann which he published in 1845. He then entered into a dispute with Grassmann about which of the two had thought of the ideas first. Grassmann had published his results in 1844, but Saint-Venant claimed that he had first developed these ideas in 1832.\n\nLinguist\nGrassmann's mathematical ideas began to spread only towards the end of his life. Thirty years after the publication of A1 the publisher wrote to Grassmann: \u201cYour book Die Ausdehnungslehre has been out of print for some time. Since your work hardly sold at all, roughly 600 copies were used in 1864 as waste paper and the remaining few odd copies have now been sold out, with the exception of the one copy in our library\u201d. Disappointed by the reception of his work in mathematical circles, Grassmann lost his contacts with mathematicians as well as his interest in geometry. The last years of his life he turned to historical linguistics and the study of Sanskrit. He wrote books on German grammar, collected folk songs, and learned Sanskrit. He wrote a 2,000-page dictionary and a translation of the Rigveda (more than 1,000 pages) which earned him a membership of the American Orientalists' Society. In modern\nRigvedic studies Grassmann's work is often cited. In 1955 the third edition of his dictionary to Rigveda was issued.\n\nGrassmann also discovered a sound law of Indo-European languages, which was named Grassmann's Law in his honor.\n\nThese philological accomplishments were honored during his lifetime; he was elected to the American Oriental Society and in 1876, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of T\u00fcbingen.\n\nBibliography\n A1: 1844.

{"title": "Large countable ordinal", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_countable_ordinal", "text": "In the mathematical discipline of set theory, there are many ways of describing specific countable ordinals. The smallest ones can be usefully and non-circularly expressed in terms of their Cantor normal forms. Beyond that, many ordinals of relevance to proof theory still have computable ordinal notations. However, it is not possible to decide effectively whether a given putative ordinal notation is a notation or not (for reasons somewhat analogous to the unsolvability of the halting problem); various more-concrete ways of defining ordinals that definitely have notations are available.\n\nSince there are only countably many notations, all ordinals with notations are exhausted well below the first uncountable ordinal \u03c91; their supremum is called Church\u2013Kleene \u03c91 or \u03c91CK (not to be confused with the first uncountable ordinal, \u03c91), described below. Ordinal numbers below \u03c91CK are the recursive ordinals (see below). Countable ordinals larger than this may still be defined, but do not have notations.\n\nDue to the focus on countable ordinals, ordinal arithmetic is used throughout, except where otherwise noted.  The ordinals described here are not as large as the ones described in large cardinals, but they are large among those that have constructive notations (descriptions).  Larger and larger ordinals can be defined, but they become more and more difficult to describe.\n\n Generalities on recursive ordinals \n\n Ordinal notations \n\nRecursive ordinals (or computable ordinals) are certain countable ordinals: loosely speaking those represented by a computable function.  There are several equivalent definitions of this: the simplest is to say that a computable ordinal is the order-type of some recursive (i.e., computable) well-ordering of the natural numbers; so, essentially, an ordinal is recursive when we can present the set of smaller ordinals in such a way that a computer (Turing machine, say) can manipulate them (and, essentially, compare them).\n\nA different definition uses Kleene's system of ordinal notations. Briefly, an ordinal notation is either the name zero (describing the ordinal 0), or the successor of an ordinal notation (describing the successor of the ordinal described by that notation), or a Turing machine (computable function) that produces an increasing sequence of ordinal notations (that describe the ordinal that is the limit of the sequence), and ordinal notations are (partially) ordered so as to make the successor of o greater than o and to make the limit greater than any term of the sequence (this order is computable; however, the set O of ordinal notations itself is highly non-recursive, owing to the impossibility of deciding whether a given Turing machine does indeed produce a sequence of notations); a recursive ordinal is then an ordinal described by some ordinal notation.\n\nAny ordinal smaller than a recursive ordinal is itself recursive, so the set of all recursive ordinals forms a certain (countable) ordinal, the Church\u2013Kleene ordinal (see below).\n\nIt is tempting to forget about ordinal notations, and only speak of the recursive ordinals themselves: and some statements are made about recursive ordinals which, in fact, concern the notations for these ordinals.  This leads to difficulties, however, as even the smallest infinite ordinal, \u03c9, has many notations, some of which cannot be proved to be equivalent to the obvious notation (the limit of the simplest program that enumerates all natural numbers).\n\n Relationship to systems of arithmetic \n\nThere is a relation between computable ordinals and certain formal systems (containing arithmetic, that is, at least a reasonable fragment of Peano arithmetic).\n\nCertain computable ordinals are so large that while they can be given by a certain ordinal notation o, a given formal system might not be sufficiently powerful to show that o is, indeed, an ordinal notation: the system does not show transfinite induction for such large ordinals.\n\nFor example, the usual first-order Peano axioms do not prove transfinite induction for (or beyond) \u03b50: while the ordinal \u03b50 can easily be arithmetically described (it is countable), the Peano axioms are not strong enough to show that it is indeed an ordinal; in fact, transfinite induction on \u03b50 proves the consistency of Peano's axioms (a theorem by Gentzen), so by G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem, Peano's axioms cannot formalize that reasoning.  (This is at the basis of the Kirby\u2013Paris theorem on Goodstein sequences.)  We say that \u03b50 measures the proof-theoretic strength of Peano's axioms.\n\nBut we can do this for systems far beyond Peano's axioms.  For example, the proof-theoretic strength of Kripke\u2013Platek set theory is the Bachmann\u2013Howard ordinal, and, in fact, merely adding to Peano's axioms the axioms that state the well-ordering of all ordinals below the Bachmann\u2013Howard ordinal is sufficient to obtain all arithmetical consequences of Kripke\u2013Platek set theory.\n\n Specific recursive ordinals \n\n Predicative definitions and the Veblen hierarchy \n\nWe have already mentioned (see  Cantor normal form) the ordinal \u03b50, which is the smallest satisfying the equation , so it is the limit of the sequence 0, 1, , , , etc.  The next ordinal satisfying this equation is called \u03b51: it is the limit of the sequence\n\nMore generally, the -th ordinal such that  is called .  We could define  as the smallest ordinal such that , but since the Greek alphabet does not have transfinitely many letters it is better to use a more robust notation: define ordinals  by transfinite induction as follows: let  and let  be the -th fixed point of  (i.e., the -th ordinal such that ; so for example, ), and when  is a limit ordinal, define  as the -th common fixed point of the  for all .  This family of functions is known as the Veblen hierarchy  (there are inessential variations in the definition, such as letting, for  a limit ordinal,  be the limit of the  for : this essentially just shifts the indices by 1, which is harmless).  is called the  Veblen function (to the base ).\n\nOrdering:  if and only if either ( and ) or ( and ) or ( and ).\n\n The Feferman\u2013Sch\u00fctte ordinal and beyond \n\nThe smallest ordinal such that  is known as the Feferman\u2013Sch\u00fctte ordinal and generally written .  It can be described as the set of all ordinals that can be written as finite expressions, starting from zero, using only the Veblen hierarchy and addition.  The Feferman\u2013Sch\u00fctte ordinal is important because, in a sense that is complicated to make precise, it is the smallest (infinite) ordinal that cannot be (\u201cpredicatively\u201d) described using smaller ordinals.  It measures the strength of such systems as \u201carithmetical transfinite recursion\u201d.\n\nMore generally, \u0393\u03b1 enumerates the ordinals that cannot be obtained from smaller ordinals using addition and the Veblen functions.\n\nIt is, of course, possible to describe ordinals beyond the Feferman\u2013Sch\u00fctte ordinal.  One could continue to seek fixed points in more and more complicated manner: enumerate the fixed points of , then enumerate the fixed points of that, and so on, and then look for the first ordinal \u03b1 such that \u03b1 is obtained in \u03b1 steps of this process, and continue diagonalizing in this ad hoc manner.  This leads to the definition of the \u201csmall\u201d and \u201clarge\u201d Veblen ordinals.\n\n Impredicative ordinals \n\nTo go far beyond the Feferman\u2013Sch\u00fctte ordinal, one needs to introduce new methods.  Unfortunately there is not yet any standard way to do this: every author in the subject seems to have invented their own system of notation, and it is quite hard to translate between the different systems. The first such system was introduced by Bachmann in 1950 (in an ad hoc manner), and different extensions and variations of it were described by Buchholz, Takeuti (ordinal diagrams), Feferman (\u03b8 systems), Aczel, Bridge, Sch\u00fctte, and Pohlers. However most systems use the same basic idea, of constructing new countable ordinals by using the existence of certain uncountable ordinals.  Here is an example of such a definition, described in much greater detail in the article on ordinal collapsing function:\n\u03c8(\u03b1) is defined to be the smallest ordinal that cannot be constructed by starting with 0, 1, \u03c9 and \u03a9, and repeatedly applying addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and \u03c8 to previously constructed ordinals (except that \u03c8 can only be applied to arguments  less than \u03b1, to ensure that it is well defined).\nHere \u03a9 = \u03c91 is the first uncountable ordinal. It is put in because otherwise the function \u03c8 gets \"stuck\" at the smallest ordinal \u03c3 such that \u03b5\u03c3=\u03c3: in particular \u03c8(\u03b1)=\u03c3 for any ordinal \u03b1 satisfying \u03c3\u2264\u03b1\u2264\u03a9. However the fact that we included \u03a9 allows us to get past this point: \u03c8(\u03a9+1) is greater than \u03c3. The key property of \u03a9 that we used is that it is greater than any ordinal produced by \u03c8.\n\nTo construct still larger ordinals, we can extend the definition of \u03c8 by throwing in  more ways of constructing uncountable ordinals. There are several ways to do this, described to some extent in the article on ordinal collapsing function.\n\nThe Bachmann\u2013Howard ordinal (sometimes just called the Howard ordinal, \u03c8(\u03b5\u03a9+1) with the notation above) is an important one, because it describes the proof-theoretic strength of Kripke\u2013Platek set theory.  Indeed, the main importance of these large ordinals, and the reason to describe them, is their relation to certain formal systems as explained above.  However, such powerful formal systems as full second-order arithmetic, let alone Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, seem beyond reach for the moment.\n\n \u201cUnrecursable\u201d recursive ordinals \n\nBy dropping the requirement of having a useful description, even larger recursive countable ordinals can be obtained as the ordinals measuring the strengths of various strong theories; roughly speaking, these ordinals are the smallest ordinals that the theories cannot prove are well ordered. By taking stronger and stronger theories such as second-order arithmetic, Zermelo set theory, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, or Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with various large cardinal axioms, one gets some extremely large recursive ordinals.  (Strictly speaking it is not known that all of these really are ordinals: by construction, the ordinal strength of a theory can only be proved to be an ordinal from an even stronger theory.  So for the large cardinal axioms this becomes quite unclear.)\n\n Beyond recursive ordinals \n\n The Church\u2013Kleene ordinal \n\nThe set of recursive ordinals is an ordinal that is the smallest ordinal that cannot be described in a recursive way. (It is not the order type of any recursive well-ordering of the integers.) That ordinal is a countable ordinal called the Church\u2013Kleene ordinal, . Thus,  is the smallest non-recursive ordinal, and there is no hope of precisely \u201cdescribing\u201d any ordinals from this point on\u2014we can only define them. But it is still far less than the first uncountable ordinal, . However, as its symbol suggests, it behaves in many ways rather like . \n\n Admissible ordinals \n\nThe Church\u2013Kleene ordinal is again related to Kripke\u2013Platek set theory, but now in a different way: whereas the Bachmann\u2013Howard ordinal (described above) was the smallest ordinal for which KP does not prove transfinite induction, the Church\u2013Kleene ordinal is the smallest \u03b1 such that the construction of the G\u00f6del universe, L, up to stage \u03b1, yields a model  of KP. Such ordinals are called admissible, thus  is the smallest admissible ordinal (beyond \u03c9 in case the axiom of infinity is not included in KP).\n\nBy a theorem of Sacks, the countable admissible ordinals are exactly those constructed in a manner similar to the Church\u2013Kleene ordinal but for Turing machines with oracles.  One sometimes writes  for the -th ordinal that is either admissible or a limit of admissible.\n\n Beyond admissible ordinals \n\nAn ordinal that is both admissible and a limit of admissibles, or equivalently such that  is the -th admissible ordinal, is called recursively inaccessible.  There exists a theory of large ordinals in this manner that is highly parallel to that of (small) large cardinals.  For example, we can define recursively Mahlo ordinals: these are the  such that every -recursive closed unbounded subset of  contains an admissible ordinal (a recursive analog of the definition of a Mahlo cardinal).  But note that we are still talking about possibly countable ordinals here. (While the existence of inaccessible or Mahlo cardinals cannot be proved in Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, that of recursively inaccessible or recursively Mahlo ordinals is a theorem of ZFC: in fact, any regular cardinal is recursively Mahlo and more, but even if we limit ourselves to countable ordinals, ZFC proves the existence of recursively Mahlo ordinals.  They are, however, beyond the reach of Kripke\u2013Platek set theory.)\n\nAn admissible ordinal  is called nonprojectible if there is no total -recursive injective function mapping  into a smaller ordinal.  (This is trivially true for regular cardinals; however, we are mainly interested in countable ordinals.)  Being nonprojectible is a much stronger condition than being admissible, recursively inaccessible, or even recursively Mahlo.  It is equivalent to the statement that the G\u00f6del universe, L, up to stage \u03b1, yields a model  of KP + -separation.\n\n \u201cUnprovable\u201d ordinals \n\nWe can imagine even larger ordinals that are still countable. For example, if ZFC has a transitive model (a hypothesis stronger than the mere hypothesis of consistency, and implied by the existence of an inaccessible cardinal), then there exists a countable  such that  is a model of ZFC.  Such ordinals are beyond the strength of ZFC in the sense that it cannot (by construction) prove their existence.\n\nEven larger countable ordinals, called the stable ordinals, can be defined by indescribability conditions or as those  such that  is a 1-elementary submodel of L; the existence of these ordinals can be proved in ZFC,Barwise (1976), theorem 7.2. and they are closely related to the nonprojectible ordinals.\n\n A pseudo-well-ordering \n\nWithin the scheme of notations of Kleene some represent ordinals and some do not. One can define a recursive total ordering that is a subset of the Kleene notations and has an initial segment which is well-ordered with order-type . Every recursively enumerable (or even hyperarithmetic) nonempty subset of this total ordering has a least element.  So it resembles a well-ordering in some respects.  For example, one can define the arithmetic operations on it.  Yet it is not possible to effectively determine exactly where the initial well-ordered part ends and the part lacking a least element begins.\n\nFor an example of a recursive pseudowellordering, let S be ATR0 or another recursively axiomatizable theory that has an \u03c9-model but no hyperarithmetical \u03c9-models, and (if needed) conservatively extend S with Skolem functions.  Let T be the tree of (essentially) finite partial \u03c9-models of S: A sequence of natural numbers  is in T iff S plus \u2203m \u03c6(m) \u21d2 \u03c6(x\u2308\u03c6\u2309) (for the first n formulas \u03c6 with one numeric free variable; \u2308\u03c6\u2309 is the G\u00f6del number) has no inconsistency proof shorter than n.  Then the Kleene\u2013Brouwer order of T is a recursive pseudowellordering.\n\nReferences\n\nMost books describing large countable ordinals are on proof theory, and unfortunately tend to be out of print.\n\nOn recursive ordinals\n Wolfram Pohlers, Proof theory, Springer 1989  (for Veblen hierarchy and some impredicative ordinals).

are from the body.\n\nVertex, a 0-dimensional element\nEdge, a 1-dimensional element\nFace, a 2-dimensional element\nCell, a 3-dimensional element\nHypercell or Teron, a 4-dimensional element\nFacet, an (n-1)-dimensional element\nRidge, an (n-2)-dimensional element\nPeak, an (n-3)-dimensional element\n\nFor example, in a polyhedron (3-dimensional polytope), a face is a facet, an edge is a ridge, and a vertex is a peak.\n\nVertex figure: not itself an element of a polytope, but a diagram showing how the elements meet.\n\nTessellations\n\nThe classical convex polytopes may be considered tessellations, or tilings, of spherical space. Tessellations of euclidean and hyperbolic space may also be considered regular polytopes. Note that an 'n'-dimensional polytope actually tessellates a space of one dimension less. For example, the (three-dimensional) platonic solids tessellate the 'two'-dimensional 'surface' of the sphere.\n\nZero dimension\nPoint\n\nOne-dimensional regular polytope\nThere is only one polytope in 1 dimension, whose boundaries are the two endpoints of a line segment, represented by the empty Schl\u00e4fli symbol {}.\n\n Two-dimensional regular polytopes \nPolygon\nEquilateral\nCyclic

A set is low if it has low degree. Since every set is computable from its jump, any low set is computable in 0\u2032, but the jump of sets computable in 0\u2032 can bound any degree r.e. in 0\u2032 (Schoenfield Jump Inversion).  X being low says that its jump X\u2032 has the least possible degree in terms of Turing reducibility for the jump of a set.\n\nA degree is low n if its n'th jump is the n'th jump of 0. A set X is generalized low if it satisfies X\u2032 \u2261T X + 0\u2032, that is: if its jump has the lowest degree possible. And a degree d is generalized low n if its n'th jump is the (n-1)'st jump of the join of d with 0\u2032. More generally, properties of sets which describe their being computationally weak (when used as a Turing oracle) are referred to under the umbrella term lowness properties.\n\nBy the Low basis theorem of Jockusch and Soare, any nonempty  class in  contains a set of low degree. This implies that, although low sets are computationally weak, they can still accomplish such feats as computing a completion of Peano Arithmetic. In practice, this allows a restriction on the computational power of objects needed for recursion theoretic constructions: for example, those used in the analyzing the proof-theoretic strength of Ramsey's theorem.\n\nSee also\nHigh (computability)\nLow Basis Theorem\n\n References \n\n \n \n\nCategory:Computability theory"}

(The proof is actually completed in Volume II, 1st edition, page 86, accompanied by the comment, \"The above proposition is occasionally useful.\" \u03a4hey go on to say \"It is used at least three times, in \u2738113.66 and \u2738120.123.472.\")\n\nThe Principia Mathematica (often abbreviated PM) is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell and published in 1910, 1912, and 1913. In 1925\u201327, it appeared in a second edition with an important Introduction to the Second Edition, an Appendix A that replaced \u27389 and all-new Appendix B and Appendix C. PM is not to be confused with Russell's 1903 The Principles of Mathematics. PM was originally conceived as a sequel volume to Russell's 1903 Principles, but as PM states, this became an unworkable suggestion for practical and philosophical reasons: \"The present work was originally intended by us to be comprised in a second volume of Principles of Mathematics... But as we advanced, it became increasingly evident that the subject is a very much larger one than we had supposed; moreover on many fundamental questions which had been left obscure and doubtful in the former work, we have now arrived at what we believe to be satisfactory solutions.\"\n\nPM, according to its introduction, had three aims: (1) to analyze to the greatest possible extent the ideas and methods of mathematical logic and to minimize the number of primitive notions and axioms, and inference rules; (2) to precisely express mathematical propositions in symbolic logic using the most convenient notation that precise expression allows; (3) to solve the paradoxes that plagued logic and set theory at the turn of the 20th-century, like Russell's paradox.\n\nThis third aim motivated the adoption of the theory of types in PM. The theory of types adopts grammatical restrictions on formulas that rules out the unrestricted comprehension of classes, properties, and functions. The effect of this is that formulas such as would allow the comprehension of objects like the Russell set turn out to be ill-formed: they violate the grammatical restrictions of the system of PM.\n\nThere is no doubt that PM is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy: as Irvine has noted, it sparked interest in symbolic logic and advanced the subject by popularizing it; it showcased the powers and capacities of symbolic logic; and it showed how advances in philosophy of mathematics and symbolic logic could go hand-in-hand with tremendous fruitfulness. Indeed, PM was in part brought about by an interest in logicism, the view on which all mathematical truths are logical truths. It was in part thanks to the advances made in PM that, despite its defects, numerous advances in meta-logic were made, including G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems.\n\nFor all that, PM is not widely used today: probably the foremost reason for this is its reputation for typographical complexity. Somewhat infamously, several hundred pages of \nPM precede the proof of the validity of the proposition 1+1=2. Contemporary mathematicians tend to use a modernized form of the system of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory. Nonetheless, the scholarly, historical, and philosophical interest in PM is great and ongoing: for example, the Modern Library placed it 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century.\n\n Scope of foundations laid \n\nThe Principia covered only set theory, cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, and real numbers. Deeper theorems from real analysis were not included, but by the end of the third volume it was clear to experts that a large amount of known mathematics could in principle be developed in the adopted formalism. It was also clear how lengthy such a development would be.\n\nA fourth volume on the foundations of geometry had been planned, but the authors admitted to intellectual exhaustion upon completion of the third.\n\n Theoretical basis \n\nAs noted in the criticism of the theory by Kurt G\u00f6del (below), unlike a formalist theory, the \"logicistic\" theory of PM has no \"precise statement of the syntax of the formalism\". Another observation is that almost immediately in the theory, interpretations (in the sense of model theory) are presented in terms of truth-values for the behaviour of the symbols \"\u22a2\" (assertion of truth), \"~\" (logical not), and \"V\" (logical inclusive OR).\n\nTruth-values: PM embeds the notions of \"truth\" and \"falsity\" in the notion \"primitive proposition\". A raw (pure) formalist theory would not provide the meaning of the symbols that form a \"primitive proposition\"\u2014the symbols themselves could be absolutely arbitrary and unfamiliar. The theory would specify only how the symbols behave based on the grammar of the theory. Then later, by assignment of \"values\", a model would specify an interpretation of what the formulas are saying. Thus in the formal Kleene symbol set below, the \"interpretation\" of what the symbols commonly mean, and by implication how they end up being used, is given in parentheses, e.g., \"\u00ac (not)\". But this is not a pure Formalist theory.\n\n Contemporary construction of a formal theory \nthumb|right|300px|list of propositions referred to by names\n\nThe following formalist theory is offered as contrast to the logicistic theory of PM. A contemporary formal system would be constructed as follows:\n Symbols used: This set is the starting set, and other symbols can appear but only by definition from these beginning symbols. A starting set might be the following set derived from Kleene 1952: logical symbols: \"\u2192\" (implies, IF-THEN, and \"\u2283\"), \"&\" (and), \"V\" (or), \"\u00ac\" (not), \"\u2200\" (for all), \"\u2203\" (there exists); predicate symbol \"=\" (equals); function symbols \"+\" (arithmetic addition), \"\u2219\" (arithmetic multiplication), \"'\" (successor); individual symbol \"0\" (zero); variables \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", etc.; and parentheses \"(\" and \")\".This set is taken from Kleene 1952:69 substituting \u2192 for \u2283.\n Symbol strings: The theory will build \"strings\" of these symbols by concatenation (juxtaposition).Kleene 1952:71, Enderton 2001:15\n Formation rules: The theory specifies the rules of syntax (rules of grammar) usually as a recursive definition that starts with \"0\" and specifies how to build acceptable strings or \"well-formed formulas\" (wffs).Enderton 2001:16 This includes a rule for \"substitution\"This is the word used by Kleene 1952:78 of strings for the symbols called \"variables\" (as opposed to the other symbol-types).\n Transformation rule(s): The axioms that specify the behaviours of the symbols and symbol sequences.\n Rule of inference, detachment, modus ponens : The rule that allows the theory to \"detach\" a \"conclusion\" from the \"premises\" that led up to it, and thereafter to discard the \"premises\" (symbols to the left of the line \u2502, or symbols above the line if horizontal). If this were not the case, then substitution would result in longer and longer strings that have to be carried forward. Indeed, after the application of modus ponens, nothing is left but the conclusion, the rest disappears forever.\n Contemporary theories often specify as their first axiom the classical or modus ponens or \"the rule of detachment\":\n A, A \u2283 B \u2502 B \n The symbol \"\u2502\" is usually written as a horizontal line, here \"\u2283\" means \"implies\". The symbols A and B are \"stand-ins\" for strings; this form of notation is called an \"axiom schema\" (i.e., there is a countable number of specific forms the notation could take). This can be read in a manner similar to IF-THEN but with a difference: given symbol string IF A and A implies B THEN B (and retain only B for further use). But the symbols have no \"interpretation\" (e.g., no \"truth table\" or \"truth values\" or \"truth functions\") and modus ponens proceeds mechanistically, by grammar alone.\n\n Construction \n\nThe theory of PM has both significant similarities, and similar differences, to a contemporary formal theory. Kleene states that \"this deduction of mathematics from logic was offered as intuitive axiomatics. The axioms were intended to be believed, or at least to be accepted as plausible hypotheses concerning the world\".Quote from Kleene 1952:45. See discussion LOGICISM at pages 43\u201346. Indeed, unlike a Formalist theory that manipulates symbols according to rules of grammar, PM introduces the notion of \"truth-values\", i.e., truth and falsity in the real-world sense, and the \"assertion of truth\" almost immediately as the fifth and sixth elements in the structure of the theory (PM 1962:4\u201336):\n Variables\n Uses of various letters\n The fundamental functions of propositions: \"the Contradictory Function\" symbolised by \"~\" and the \"Logical Sum or Disjunctive Function\" symbolised by \"\u2228\" being taken as primitive and logical implication defined (the following example also used to illustrate 9. Definition below) asp \u2283 q .=. ~ p \u2228 q Df. (PM 1962:11) and logical product defined as p . q .=. ~(~p \u2228 ~q) Df. (PM 1962:12)\n Equivalence: Logical equivalence, not arithmetic equivalence: \"\u2261\" given as a demonstration of how the symbols are used, i.e., \"Thus ' p \u2261 q ' stands for '( p \u2283 q ) . ( q \u2283 p )'.\" (PM 1962:7). Notice that to discuss a notation PM identifies a \"meta\"-notation with \"[space] ... [space]\":In his section 8.5.4 Groping towards metalogic Grattan-Guinness 2000:454ff discusses the American logicians' critical reception of the second edition of PM. For instance Sheffer \"puzzled that ' In order to give an account of logic, we must presuppose and employ logic ' \" (p. 452). And Bernstein ended his 1926 review with the comment that \"This distinction between the propositional logic as a mathematical system and as a language must be made, if serious errors are to be avoided; this distinction the Principia does not make\" (p.454).Logical equivalence appears again as a definition:p \u2261 q .=. ( p \u2283 q ) . ( q \u2283 p ) (PM 1962:12),Notice the appearance of parentheses. This grammatical usage is not specified and appears sporadically; parentheses do play an important role in symbol strings, however, e.g., the notation \"(x)\" for the contemporary \"\u2200x\".\n Truth-values: \"The 'Truth-value' of a proposition is truth if it is true, and falsehood if it is false\" (this phrase is due to Frege) (PM 1962:7).\n Assertion-sign: \"'\u22a6. p may be read 'it is true that' ... thus '\u22a6: p .\u2283. q ' means 'it is true that p implies q ', whereas '\u22a6. p .\u2283\u22a6. q ' means ' p is true; therefore q is true'. The first of these does not necessarily involve the truth either of p or of q, while the second involves the truth of both\" (PM 1962:92).\n Inference: PM 's version of modus ponens. \"[If] '\u22a6. p ' and '\u22a6 (p \u2283 q)' have occurred, then '\u22a6 . q ' will occur if it is desired to put it on record. The process of the inference cannot be reduced to symbols. Its sole record is the occurrence of '\u22a6. q ' [in other words, the symbols on the left disappear or can be erased]\" (PM 1962:9).\n The use of dots\n Definitions: These use the \"=\" sign with \"Df\" at the right end.\n Summary of preceding statements: brief discussion of the primitive ideas \"~ p\" and \"p \u2228 q\" and \"\u22a6\" prefixed to a proposition.\n Primitive propositions: the axioms or postulates. This was significantly modified in the second edition.\n Propositional functions: The notion of \"proposition\" was significantly modified in the second edition, including the introduction of \"atomic\" propositions linked by logical signs to form \"molecular\" propositions, and the use of substitution of molecular propositions into atomic or molecular propositions to create new expressions.\n The range of values and total variation\n Ambiguous assertion and the real variable: This and the next two sections were modified or abandoned in the second edition. In particular, the distinction between the concepts defined in sections 15. Definition and the real variable and 16 Propositions connecting real and apparent variables was abandoned in the second edition.\n Formal implication and formal equivalence\n Identity\n Classes and relations\n Various descriptive functions of relations\n Plural descriptive functions\n Unit classes\n\n Primitive ideas \n\nCf. PM 1962:90\u201394, for the first edition:\n (1) Elementary propositions.\n (2) Elementary propositions of functions.\n (3) Assertion: introduces the notions of \"truth\" and \"falsity\".\n (4) Assertion of a propositional function.\n (5) Negation: \"If p is any proposition, the proposition \"not-p\", or \"p is false,\" will be represented by \"~p\" \".\n (6) Disjunction: \"If p and q are any propositions, the proposition \"p or q, i.e., \"either p is true or q is true,\" where the alternatives are to be not mutually exclusive, will be represented by \"p \u2228 q\" \".\n (cf. section B)\n\n Primitive propositions \n\nThe first edition (see discussion relative to the second edition, below) begins with a definition of the sign \"\u2283\"\u27381.01. p \u2283 q .=. ~ p \u2228 q.

Pp\u27381.72. If \u03c6p and \u03c8p are elementary propositional functions which take elementary propositions as arguments, \u03c6p \u2228 \u03c8p is an elementary proposition. PpTogether with the \"Introduction to the Second Edition\", the second edition's Appendix A abandons the entire section \u27389. This includes six primitive propositions \u27389 through \u27389.15 together with the Axioms of reducibility.\n\nThe revised theory is made difficult by the introduction of the Sheffer stroke (\"|\") to symbolise \"incompatibility\" (i.e., if both elementary propositions p and q are true, their \"stroke\" p | q is false), the contemporary logical NAND (not-AND). In the revised theory, the Introduction presents the notion of \"atomic proposition\", a \"datum\" that \"belongs to the philosophical part of logic\". These have no parts that are propositions and do not contain the notions \"all\" or \"some\". For example: \"this is red\", or \"this is earlier than that\". Such things can exist ad finitum, i.e., even an \"infinite enumeration\" of them to replace \"generality\" (i.e., the notion of \"for all\").This idea is due to Wittgenstein's Tractatus. See the discussion at PM 1962:xiv\u2013xv) PM then \"advance[s] to molecular propositions\" that are all linked by \"the stroke\". Definitions give equivalences for \"~\", \"\u2228\", \"\u2283\", and \".\".\n\nThe new introduction defines \"elementary propositions\" as atomic and molecular positions together. It then replaces all the primitive propositions \u27381.2 to \u27381.72 with a single primitive proposition framed in terms of the stroke:\n \"If p, q, r are elementary propositions, given p and p|(q|r), we can infer r. This is a primitive proposition.\"\n\nThe new introduction keeps the notation for \"there exists\" (now recast as \"sometimes true\") and \"for all\" (recast as \"always true\"). Appendix A strengthens the notion of \"matrix\" or \"predicative function\" (a \"primitive idea\", PM 1962:164) and presents four new Primitive propositions as \u27388.1\u2013\u27388.13.\u273888. Multiplicative axiom\u2738120. Axiom of infinity\n\nRamified types and the axiom of reducibility\n\nIn simple type theory objects are elements of various disjoint \"types\". Types are implicitly built up as follows. If \u03c41,...,\u03c4m are types then there is a type (\u03c41,...,\u03c4m) that can be thought of as the class of propositional functions of \u03c41,...,\u03c4m (which in set theory is essentially the set of subsets of \u03c41\u00d7...\u00d7\u03c4m). In particular there is a type () of propositions, and there may be a type \u03b9 (iota) of \"individuals\" from which other types are built. Russell and Whitehead's notation for building up types from other types is rather cumbersome, and the notation here is due to Church.\n\nIn the ramified type theory of PM all objects are elements of various disjoint ramified types. Ramified types are implicitly built up as follows. If \u03c41,...,\u03c4m,\u03c31,...,\u03c3n are ramified types then as in simple type theory there is a type (\u03c41,...,\u03c4m,\u03c31,...,\u03c3n) of \"predicative\" propositional functions of \u03c41,...,\u03c4m,\u03c31,...,\u03c3n. However, there are also ramified types (\u03c41,...,\u03c4m|\u03c31,...,\u03c3n) that can be thought of as the classes of propositional functions of \u03c41,...\u03c4m obtained from propositional functions of type (\u03c41,...,\u03c4m,\u03c31,...,\u03c3n) by quantifying over \u03c31,...,\u03c3n. When n=0 (so there are no \u03c3s) these propositional functions are called predicative functions or matrices. This can be confusing because current mathematical practice does not distinguish between predicative and non-predicative functions, and in any case PM never defines exactly what a \"predicative function\" actually is: this is taken as a primitive notion.\n\nRussell and Whitehead found it impossible to develop mathematics while maintaining the difference between predicative and non-predicative functions, so they introduced the axiom of reducibility, saying that for every non-predicative function there is a predicative function taking the same values. In practice this axiom essentially means that the elements of type (\u03c41,...,\u03c4m|\u03c31,...,\u03c3n) can be identified with the elements of type (\u03c41,...,\u03c4m), which causes the hierarchy of ramified types to collapse down to simple type theory. (Strictly speaking this is not quite correct, because PM allows two propositional functions to be different even if they take the same values on all arguments; this differs from current mathematical practice where one normally identifies two such functions.)\n\nIn Zermelo set theory one can model the ramified type theory of PM as follows. One picks a set \u03b9 to be the type of individuals. For example, \u03b9 might be the set of natural numbers, or the set of atoms (in a set theory with atoms) or any other set one is interested in. Then if \u03c41,...,\u03c4m are types, the type (\u03c41,...,\u03c4m) is the power set of the product \u03c41\u00d7...\u00d7\u03c4m, which can also be thought of informally as the set of (propositional predicative) functions from this product to a 2-element set {true,false}. The ramified type (\u03c41,...,\u03c4m|\u03c31,...,\u03c3n) can be modeled \nas the product of the type (\u03c41,...,\u03c4m,\u03c31,...,\u03c3n) with the set of sequences of n quantifiers (\u2200 or \u2203) indicating which quantifier should be applied to each variable \u03c3i. (One can vary this slightly by allowing the \u03c3s to be quantified in any order, or allowing them to occur before some of the \u03c4s, but this makes little difference except to the bookkeeping.)\n\n Notation \n\nOne author observes that \"The notation in that work has been superseded by the subsequent development of logic during the 20th century, to the extent that the beginner has trouble reading PM at all\"; while much of the symbolic content can be converted to modern notation, the original notation itself is \"a subject of scholarly dispute\", and some notation \"embodies substantive logical doctrines so that it cannot simply be replaced by contemporary symbolism\".\n\nKurt G\u00f6del was harshly critical of the notation:\n\"It is to be regretted that this first comprehensive and thorough-going presentation of a mathematical logic and the derivation of mathematics from it [is] so greatly lacking in formal precision in the foundations (contained in \u27381\u2013\u273821 of Principia [i.e., sections \u27381\u2013\u27385 (propositional logic), \u27388\u201314 (predicate logic with identity/equality), \u273820 (introduction to set theory), and \u273821 (introduction to relations theory)]) that it represents in this respect a considerable step backwards as compared with Frege. What is missing, above all, is a precise statement of the syntax of the formalism. Syntactical considerations are omitted even in cases where they are necessary for the cogency of the proofs\".Kurt G\u00f6del 1944 \"Russell's mathematical logic\" appearing at page 120 in Feferman et al. 1990 Kurt G\u00f6del Collected Works Volume II, Oxford University Press, NY, (v.2.pbk.) .\nThis is reflected in the example below of the symbols \"p\", \"q\", \"r\" and \"\u2283\" that can be formed into the string \"p \u2283 q \u2283 r\". PM requires a definition of what this symbol-string means in terms of other symbols; in contemporary treatments the \"formation rules\" (syntactical rules leading to \"well formed formulas\") would have prevented the formation of this string.Source of the notation: Chapter I \"Preliminary Explanations of Ideas and Notations\" begins with the source of the elementary parts of the notation (the symbols =\u2283\u2261\u2212\u039bV\u03b5 and the system of dots):\n\"The notation adopted in the present work is based upon that of Peano, and the following explanations are to some extent modeled on those which he prefixes to his Formulario Mathematico [i.e., Peano 1889]. His use of dots as brackets is adopted, and so are many of his symbols\" (PM 1927:4).For comparison, see the translated portion of Peano 1889 in van Heijenoort 1967:81ff.\nPM changed Peano's \u0186 to \u2283, and also adopted a few of Peano's later symbols, such as \u2129 and \u03b9, and Peano's practice of turning letters upside down.\n\nPM adopts the assertion sign \"\u22a6\" from Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift:This work can be found at van Heijenoort 1967:1ff.\n\"(I)t may be read 'it is true that'\"And see footnote, both at PM 1927:92\nThus to assert a proposition p PM writes:\n\"\u22a6. p.\" (PM 1927:92)\n(Observe that, as in the original, the left dot is square and of greater size than the period on the right.)\n\nMost of the rest of the notation in PM was invented by Whitehead. \n\n An introduction to the notation of \"Section A Mathematical Logic\" (formulas \u27381\u2013\u27385.71) \n \n\nPM 's dotsThe original typography is a square of a heavier weight than the conventional period. are used in a manner similar to parentheses. Each dot (or multiple dot) represents either a left or right parenthesis or the logical symbol \u2227. More than one dot indicates the \"depth\" of the parentheses, for example, \".\", \":\" or \":.\", \"::\". However the position of the matching right or left parenthesis is not indicated explicitly in the notation but has to be deduced from some rules that are complex and at times ambiguous. Moreover, when the dots stand for a logical symbol \u2227 its left and right operands have to be deduced using similar rules. First one has to decide based on context whether the dots stand for a left or right parenthesis or a logical symbol. Then one has to decide how far the other corresponding parenthesis is: here one carries on until one meets either a larger number of dots, or the same number of dots next that have equal or greater \"force\", or the end of the line. Dots next to the signs \u2283, \u2261,\u2228, =Df have greater force than dots next to (x), (\u2203x) and so on, which have greater force than dots indicating a logical product \u2227.\n\nExample 1. The line\n\u27383.4. \u22a2 : p . q . \u2283 . p \u2283 q\ncorresponds to\n\u22a2 ((p \u2227 q) \u2283 (p \u2283 q)).\nThe two dots standing together immediately following the assertion-sign indicate that what is asserted is the entire line: since there are two of them, their scope is greater than that of any of the single dots to their right. They are replaced by a left parenthesis standing where the dots are and a right parenthesis at the end of the formula, thus:\n\u22a2 (p . q . \u2283 . p \u2283 q).\n(In practice, these outermost parentheses, which enclose an entire formula, are usually suppressed.) The first of the single dots, standing between two propositional variables, represents conjunction. It belongs to the third group and has the narrowest scope. Here it is replaced by the modern symbol for conjunction \"\u2227\", thus\n\u22a2 (p \u2227 q . \u2283 . p \u2283 q).\nThe two remaining single dots pick out the main connective of the whole formula. They illustrate the utility of the dot notation in picking out those connectives which are relatively more important than the ones which surround them. The one to the left of the \"\u2283\" is replaced by a pair of parentheses, the right one goes where the dot is and the left one goes as far to the left as it can without crossing a group of dots of greater force, in this case the two dots which follow the assertion-sign, thus\n\u22a2 ((p \u2227 q) . \u2283 . p \u2283 q)\nThe dot to the right of the \"\u2283\" is replaced by a left parenthesis which goes where the dot is and a right parenthesis which goes as far to the right as it can without going beyond the scope already established by a group of dots of greater force (in this case the two dots which followed the assertion-sign). So the right parenthesis which replaces the dot to the right of the \"\u2283\" is placed in front of the right parenthesis which replaced the two dots following the assertion-sign, thus\n\u22a2 ((p \u2227 q) \u2283 (p \u2283 q)).\n\nExample 2, with double, triple, and quadruple dots: \u27389.521. \u22a2 :\u2009: (\u2203x). \u03c6x . \u2283 . q : \u2283 :\u2009. (\u2203x). \u03c6x . v . r : \u2283 . q v r\nstands for\n((((\u2203x)(\u03c6x)) \u2283 (q)) \u2283 ((((\u2203x) (\u03c6x)) v (r)) \u2283 (q v r)))\n\nExample 3, with a double dot indicating a logical symbol (from volume 1, page 10):\np\u2283q:q\u2283r.\u2283.p\u2283r\nstands for \n((p\u2283q) \u2227 (q\u2283r))\u2283(p\u2283r)\nwhere the double dot represents the logical symbol \u2227 and can be viewed as having the same priority as a non-logical single dot.\n\nLater in section \u273814, brackets \"[ ]\" appear, and in sections \u273820 and following, braces \"{ }\" appear. Whether these symbols have specific meanings or are just for visual clarification is unclear. Unfortunately the single dot (but also \":\", \":.\", \"::\", etc.) is also used to symbolise \"logical product\" (contemporary logical AND often symbolised by \"&\" or \"\u2227\").\n\nLogical implication is represented by Peano's \"\u0186\" simplified to \"\u2283\", logical negation is symbolised by an elongated tilde, i.e., \"~\" (contemporary \"~\" or \"\u00ac\"), the logical OR by \"v\". The symbol \"=\" together with \"Df\" is used to indicate \"is defined as\", whereas in sections \u273813 and following, \"=\" is defined as (mathematically) \"identical with\", i.e., contemporary mathematical \"equality\" (cf. discussion in section \u273813). Logical equivalence is represented by \"\u2261\" (contemporary \"if and only if\"); \"elementary\" propositional functions are written in the customary way, e.g., \"f(p)\", but later the function sign appears directly before the variable without parenthesis e.g., \"\u03c6x\", \"\u03c7x\", etc.\n\nExample, PM introduces the definition of \"logical product\" as follows:\u27383.01. p . q .=. ~(~p v ~q) Df.\n where \"p . q\" is the logical product of p and q.\u27383.02. p \u2283 q \u2283 r .=. p \u2283 q . q \u2283 r Df.\n This definition serves merely to abbreviate proofs.Translation of the formulas into contemporary symbols: Various authors use alternate symbols, so no definitive translation can be given. However, because of criticisms such as that of Kurt G\u00f6del below, the best contemporary treatments will be very precise with respect to the \"formation rules\" (the syntax) of the formulas.\n\nThe first formula might be converted into modern symbolism as follows:The first example comes from plato.stanford.edu (loc.cit.).\n (p & q) =df (~(~p v ~q))\nalternately\n (p & q) =df (\u00ac(\u00acp v \u00acq))\nalternately\n (p \u2227 q) =df (\u00ac(\u00acp v \u00acq))\netc.\n\nThe second formula might be converted as follows:\n (p \u2192 q \u2192 r) =df (p \u2192 q) & (q \u2192 r)\nBut note that this is not (logically) equivalent to (p \u2192 (q \u2192 r)) nor to ((p \u2192 q) \u2192 r), and these two are not logically equivalent either.\n\n An introduction to the notation of \"Section B Theory of Apparent Variables\" (formulas \u27388\u2013\u273814.34) \n\nThese sections concern what is now known as predicate logic, and predicate logic with identity (equality).\n\n NB: As a result of criticism and advances, the second edition of PM (1927) replaces \u27389 with a new \u27388 (Appendix A). This new section eliminates the first edition's distinction between real and apparent variables, and it eliminates \"the primitive idea 'assertion of a propositional function'.page xiii of 1927 appearing in the 1962 paperback edition to \u273856. To add to the complexity of the treatment, \u27388 introduces the notion of substituting a \"matrix\", and the Sheffer stroke:\n Matrix: In contemporary usage, PM 's matrix is (at least for propositional functions), a truth table, i.e., all truth-values of a propositional or predicate function.\n Sheffer stroke: Is the contemporary logical NAND (NOT-AND), i.e., \"incompatibility\", meaning:\n\"Given two propositions p and q, then ' p | q ' means \"proposition p is incompatible with proposition q\", i.e., if both propositions p and q evaluate as true, then and only then p | q evaluates as false.\" After section \u27388 the Sheffer stroke sees no usage. \n\nSection \u273810: The existential and universal \"operators\": PM adds \"(x)\" to represent the contemporary symbolism \"for all x \" i.e., \" \u2200x\", and it uses a backwards serifed E to represent \"there exists an x\", i.e., \"(\u018ex)\", i.e., the contemporary \"\u2203x\". The typical notation would be similar to the following:\n \"(x) . \u03c6x\" means \"for all values of variable x, function \u03c6 evaluates to true\"\n \"(\u018ex) . \u03c6x\" means \"for some value of variable x, function \u03c6 evaluates to true\"\n\nSections \u273810, \u273811, \u273812: Properties of a variable extended to all individuals: section \u273810 introduces the notion of \"a property\" of a \"variable\". PM gives the example: \u03c6 is a function that indicates \"is a Greek\", and \u03c8 indicates \"is a man\", and \u03c7 indicates \"is a mortal\" these functions then apply to a variable x. PM can now write, and evaluate:\n (x) . \u03c8x\nThe notation above means \"for all x, x is a man\". Given a collection of individuals, one can evaluate the above formula for truth or falsity. For example, given the restricted collection of individuals { Socrates, Plato, Russell, Zeus } the above evaluates to \"true\" if we allow for Zeus to be a man. But it fails for:\n (x) . \u03c6x\nbecause Russell is not Greek. And it fails for\n (x) . \u03c7x\nbecause Zeus is not a mortal.\n\nEquipped with this notation PM can create formulas to express the following: \"If all Greeks are men and if all men are mortals then all Greeks are mortals\". (PM 1962:138)\n(x) . \u03c6x \u2283 \u03c8x :(x). \u03c8x \u2283 \u03c7x :\u2283: (x) . \u03c6x \u2283 \u03c7x\n\nAnother example: the formula:\u273810.01. (\u018ex). \u03c6x . = . ~(x) . ~\u03c6x Df.\n\nmeans \"The symbols representing the assertion 'There exists at least one x that satisfies function \u03c6' is defined by the symbols representing the assertion 'It's not true that, given all values of x, there are no values of x satisfying \u03c6'\".\n\nThe symbolisms \u2283x and \"\u2261x\" appear at \u273810.02 and \u273810.03. Both are abbreviations for universality (i.e., for all) that bind the variable x to the logical operator. Contemporary notation would have simply used parentheses outside of the equality (\"=\") sign:\u273810.02 \u03c6x \u2283x \u03c8x .=. (x). \u03c6x \u2283 \u03c8x Df Contemporary notation: \u2200x(\u03c6(x) \u2192 \u03c8(x)) (or a variant)\u273810.03 \u03c6x \u2261x \u03c8x .=. (x). \u03c6x \u2261 \u03c8x Df Contemporary notation: \u2200x(\u03c6(x) \u2194 \u03c8(x)) (or a variant)\n\nPM attributes the first symbolism to Peano.\n\nSection \u273811 applies this symbolism to two variables. Thus the following notations: \u2283x, \u2283y, \u2283x, y could all appear in a single formula.\n\nSection \u273812 reintroduces the notion of \"matrix\" (contemporary truth table), the notion of logical types, and in particular the notions of first-order and second-order functions and propositions.\n\nNew symbolism \"\u03c6 ! x\" represents any value of a first-order function. If a circumflex \"\uff3e\" is placed over a variable, then this is an \"individual\" value of y, meaning that \"\u0177\" indicates \"individuals\" (e.g., a row in a truth table); this distinction is necessary because of the matrix/extensional nature of propositional functions.\n\nNow equipped with the matrix notion, PM can assert its controversial axiom of reducibility: a function of one or two variables (two being sufficient for PM 's use) where all its values are given (i.e., in its matrix) is (logically) equivalent (\"\u2261\") to some \"predicative\" function of the same variables. The one-variable definition is given below as an illustration of the notation (PM 1962:166\u2013167):\u273812.1 \u22a2: (\u018e f): \u03c6x .\u2261x. f ! x Pp;\n Pp is a \"Primitive proposition\" (\"Propositions assumed without proof\") (PM 1962:12, i.e., contemporary \"axioms\"), adding to the 7 defined in section \u27381 (starting with \u27381.1 modus ponens). These are to be distinguished from the \"primitive ideas\" that include the assertion sign \"\u22a2\", negation \"~\", logical OR \"V\", the notions of \"elementary proposition\" and \"elementary propositional function\"; these are as close as PM comes to rules of notational formation, i.e., syntax.\n\nThis means: \"We assert the truth of the following: There exists a function f with the property that: given all values of x, their evaluations in function \u03c6 (i.e., resulting their matrix) is logically equivalent to some f evaluated at those same values of x. (and vice versa, hence logical equivalence)\". In other words: given a matrix determined by property \u03c6 applied to variable x, there exists a function f that, when applied to the x is logically equivalent to the matrix. Or: every matrix \u03c6x can be represented by a function f applied to x, and vice versa.\u273813: The identity operator \"=\" : This is a definition that uses the sign in two different ways, as noted by the quote from PM:\u273813.01. x = y .=: (\u03c6): \u03c6 ! x . \u2283 . \u03c6 ! y Dfmeans:\n\"This definition states that x and y are to be called identical when every predicative function satisfied by x is also satisfied by y ... Note that the second sign of equality in the above definition is combined with \"Df\", and thus is not really the same symbol as the sign of equality which is defined.\"\nThe not-equals sign \"\u2260\" makes its appearance as a definition at \u273813.02.\u273814: Descriptions:\n\"A description is a phrase of the form \"the term y which satisfies \u03c6\u0177, where \u03c6\u0177 is some function satisfied by one and only one argument.\"The original typography employs an x with a circumflex rather than \u0177; this continues below\nFrom this PM employs two new symbols, a forward \"E\" and an inverted iota \"\u2129\". Here is an example:\u273814.02. E ! ( \u2129y) (\u03c6y) .=: ( \u018eb):\u03c6y . \u2261y . y = b Df.\nThis has the meaning:\n \"The y satisfying \u03c6\u0177 exists,\" which holds when, and only when \u03c6\u0177 is satisfied by one value of y and by no other value.\" (PM 1967:173\u2013174)\n\n Introduction to the notation of the theory of classes and relations \n\nThe text leaps from section \u273814 directly to the foundational sections \u273820 GENERAL THEORY OF CLASSES and \u273821 GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIONS. \"Relations\" are what is known in contemporary set theory as sets of ordered pairs. Sections \u273820 and \u273822 introduce many of the symbols still in contemporary usage. These include the symbols \"\u03b5\", \"\u2282\", \"\u2229\", \"\u222a\", \"\u2013\", \"\u039b\", and \"V\": \"\u03b5\" signifies \"is an element of\" (PM 1962:188); \"\u2282\" (\u273822.01) signifies \"is contained in\", \"is a subset of\"; \"\u2229\" (\u273822.02) signifies the intersection (logical product) of classes (sets); \"\u222a\" (\u273822.03) signifies the union (logical sum) of classes (sets); \"\u2013\" (\u273822.03) signifies negation of a class (set); \"\u039b\" signifies the null class; and \"V\" signifies the universal class or universe of discourse.\n\nSmall Greek letters (other than \"\u03b5\", \"\u03b9\", \"\u03c0\", \"\u03c6\", \"\u03c8\", \"\u03c7\", and \"\u03b8\") represent classes (e.g., \"\u03b1\", \"\u03b2\", \"\u03b3\", \"\u03b4\", etc.) (PM 1962:188):\n x \u03b5 \u03b1\n \"The use of single letter in place of symbols such as \u1e91(\u03c6z) or \u1e91(\u03c6 ! z) is practically almost indispensable, since otherwise the notation rapidly becomes intolerably cumbrous. Thus ' x \u03b5 \u03b1' will mean ' x is a member of the class \u03b1'\". (PM 1962:188)\n\u03b1 \u222a \u2013\u03b1 = V\nThe union of a set and its inverse is the universal (completed) set.See the ten postulates of Huntington, in particular postulates IIa and IIb at PM 1962:205 and discussion at page 206.\n\u03b1 \u2229 \u2013\u03b1 = \u039b\nThe intersection of a set and its inverse is the null (empty) set.\n\nWhen applied to relations in section \u273823 CALCULUS OF RELATIONS, the symbols \"\u2282\", \"\u2229\", \"\u222a\", and \"\u2013\" acquire a dot: for example: \"\u228d\", \"\u2238\".The \"\u2282\" sign has a dot inside it, and the intersection sign \"\u2229\" has a dot above it; these are not available in the \"Arial Unicode MS\" font.The notion, and notation, of \"a class\" (set): In the first edition PM asserts that no new primitive ideas are necessary to define what is meant by \"a class\", and only two new \"primitive propositions\" called the axioms of reducibility for classes and relations respectively (PM 1962:25).Wiener 1914 \"A simplification of the logic of relations\" (van Heijenoort 1967:224ff) disposed of the second of these when he showed how to reduce the theory of relations to that of classes But before this notion can be defined, PM feels it necessary to create a peculiar notation \"\u1e91(\u03c6z)\" that it calls a \"fictitious object\". (PM 1962:188)\n \u22a2: x \u03b5 \u1e91(\u03c6z) .\u2261. (\u03c6x)\n \"i.e., ' x is a member of the class determined by (\u03c6\u1e91)' is [logically] equivalent to ' x satisfies (\u03c6\u1e91),' or to '(\u03c6x) is true.'\". (PM 1962:25)\n\nAt least PM can tell the reader how these fictitious objects behave, because \"A class is wholly determinate when its membership is known, that is, there cannot be two different classes having the same membership\" (PM 1962:26). This is symbolised by the following equality (similar to \u273813.01 above:\n \u1e91(\u03c6z) = \u1e91(\u03c8z) . \u2261 : (x): \u03c6x .\u2261. \u03c8x\n\"This last is the distinguishing characteristic of classes, and justifies us in treating \u1e91(\u03c8z) as the class determined by [the function] \u03c8\u1e91.\" (PM 1962:188)\n\nPerhaps the above can be made clearer by the discussion of classes in Introduction to the Second Edition, which disposes of the Axiom of Reducibility and replaces it with the notion: \"All functions of functions are extensional\" (PM 1962:xxxix), i.e.,\n \u03c6x \u2261x \u03c8x .\u2283. (x): \u0192(\u03c6\u1e91) \u2261 \u0192(\u03c8\u1e91) (PM 1962:xxxix)\n\nThis has the reasonable meaning that \"IF for all values of x the truth-values of the functions \u03c6 and \u03c8 of x are [logically] equivalent, THEN the function \u0192 of a given \u03c6\u1e91 and \u0192 of \u03c8\u1e91 are [logically] equivalent.\" PM asserts this is \"obvious\":\n \"This is obvious, since \u03c6 can only occur in \u0192(\u03c6\u1e91) by the substitution of values of \u03c6 for p, q, r, ... in a [logical-] function, and, if \u03c6x \u2261 \u03c8x, the substitution of \u03c6x for p in a [logical-] function gives the same truth-value to the truth-function as the substitution of \u03c8x. Consequently there is no longer any reason to distinguish between functions classes, for we have, in virtue of the above,\n \u03c6x \u2261x \u03c8x .\u2283. (x). \u03c6\u1e91 = .''' \u03c8\u1e91\".\nObserve the change to the equality \"=\" sign on the right. PM goes on to state that will continue to hang onto the notation \"\u1e91(\u03c6z)\", but this is merely equivalent to \u03c6\u1e91, and this is a class. (all quotes: PM 1962:xxxix).\n\n Consistency and criticisms \n\nAccording to Carnap's \"Logicist Foundations of Mathematics\", Russell wanted a theory that could plausibly be said to derive all of mathematics from purely logical axioms. However, Principia Mathematica required, in addition to the basic axioms of type theory, three further axioms that seemed to not be true as mere matters of logic, namely the axiom of infinity, the axiom of choice, and the axiom of reducibility. Since the first two were existential axioms, Russell phrased mathematical statements depending on them as conditionals. But reducibility was required to be sure that the formal statements even properly express statements of real analysis, so that statements depending on it could not be reformulated as conditionals. Frank P. Ramsey tried to argue that Russell's ramification of the theory of types was unnecessary, so that reducibility could be removed, but these arguments seemed inconclusive.\n\nBeyond the status of the axioms as logical truths, one can ask the following questions about any system such as PM:\n whether a contradiction could be derived from the axioms (the question of inconsistency), and\n whether there exists a mathematical statement which could neither be proven nor disproven in the system (the question of completeness).\n\nPropositional logic itself was known to be consistent, but the same had not been established for Principias axioms of set theory. (See Hilbert's second problem.) Russell and Whitehead suspected that the system in PM is incomplete: for example, they pointed out that it does not seem powerful enough to show that the cardinal \u2135\u03c9 exists. However, one can ask if some recursively axiomatizable extension of it is complete and consistent.\n\nG\u00f6del 1930, 1931\n\nIn 1930, G\u00f6del's completeness theorem showed that first-order predicate logic itself was complete in a much weaker sense\u2014that is, any sentence that is unprovable from a given set of axioms must actually be false in some model of the axioms. However, this is not the stronger sense of completeness desired for Principia Mathematica, since a given system of axioms (such as those of Principia Mathematica) may have many models, in some of which a given statement is true and in others of which that statement is false, so that the statement is left undecided by the axioms.\n\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems cast unexpected light on these two related questions.\n\nG\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem showed that no recursive extension of Principia could be both consistent and complete for arithmetic statements. (As mentioned above, Principia itself was already known to be incomplete for some non-arithmetic statements.) According to the theorem, within every sufficiently powerful recursive logical system (such as Principia), there exists a statement G that essentially reads, \"The statement G cannot be proved.\" Such a statement is a sort of Catch-22: if G is provable, then it is false, and the system is therefore inconsistent; and if G is not provable, then it is true, and the system is therefore incomplete.\n\nG\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem (1931) shows that no formal system extending basic arithmetic can be used to prove its own consistency. Thus, the statement \"there are no contradictions in the Principia system\" cannot be proven in the Principia system unless there are contradictions in the system (in which case it can be proven both true and false).\n\n Wittgenstein 1919, 1939 \nBy the second edition of PM, Russell had removed his axiom of reducibility to a new axiom (although he does not state it as such). G\u00f6del 1944:126 describes it this way: \n\"This change is connected with the new axiom that functions can occur in propositions only \"through their values\", i.e., extensionally . . . [this is] quite unobjectionable even from the constructive standpoint . . . provided that quantifiers are always restricted to definite orders\". This change from a quasi-intensional stance to a fully extensional stance also restricts predicate logic to the second order, i.e. functions of functions: \"We can decide that mathematics is to confine itself to functions of functions which obey the above assumption\" (PM 2nd edition p.\u00a0401, Appendix C).\n\nThis new proposal resulted in a dire outcome. An \"extensional stance\" and restriction to a second-order predicate logic means that a propositional function extended to all individuals such as \"All 'x' are blue\" now has to list all of the 'x' that satisfy (are true in) the proposition, listing them in a possibly infinite conjunction: e.g. x1 \u2227 x2 \u2227 . . . \u2227 xn \u2227 . . .. Ironically, this change came about as the result of criticism from Wittgenstein in his 1919 Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. As described by Russell in the Introduction to the Second Edition of PM:\n\"There is another course, recommended by Wittgenstein\u2020 (\u2020Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, *5.54ff) for philosophical reasons. This is to assume that functions of propositions are always truth-functions, and that a function can only occur in a proposition through its values. [...] [Working through the consequences] it appears that everything in Vol. I remains true (though often new proofs are required); the theory of inductive cardinals and ordinals survives; but it seems that the theory of infinite Dedekindian and well-ordered series largely collapses, so that irrationals, and real numbers generally, can no longer be adequately dealt with. Also Cantor's proof that 2n > n breaks down unless n is finite.\" (PM 2nd edition reprinted 1962:xiv, also cf. new Appendix C).\nIn other words, the fact that an infinite list cannot realistically be specified means that the concept of \"number\" in the infinite sense (i.e. the continuum) cannot be described by the new theory proposed in PM Second Edition.\n\nWittgenstein in his Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics, Cambridge 1939 criticised Principia on various grounds, such as:\n It purports to reveal the fundamental basis for arithmetic. However, it is our everyday arithmetical practices such as counting which are fundamental; for if a persistent discrepancy arose between counting and Principia, this would be treated as evidence of an error in Principia (e.g., that Principia did not characterise numbers or addition correctly), not as evidence of an error in everyday counting.\n The calculating methods in Principia can only be used in practice with very small numbers. To calculate using large numbers (e.g., billions), the formulae would become too long, and some short-cut method would have to be used, which would no doubt rely on everyday techniques such as counting (or else on non-fundamental and hence questionable methods such as induction). So again Principia depends on everyday techniques, not vice versa.\n\nWittgenstein did, however, concede that Principia may nonetheless make some aspects of everyday arithmetic clearer.\n\nG\u00f6del 1944\nIn his 1944 Russell's mathematical logic, G\u00f6del offers a \"critical but sympathetic discussion of the logicistic order of ideas\":Kleene 1952:46.\n\"It is to be regretted that this first comprehensive and thorough-going presentation of a mathematical logic and the derivation of mathematics from it [is] so greatly lacking in formal precision in the foundations (contained in *1-*21 of Principia) that it represents in this respect a considerable step backwards as compared with Frege. What is missing, above all, is a precise statement of the syntax of the formalism. Syntactical considerations are omitted even in cases where they are necessary for the cogency of the proofs . . . The matter is especially doubtful for the rule of substitution and of replacing defined symbols by their definiens . . . it is chiefly the rule of substitution which would have to be proved\" (G\u00f6del 1944:124)G\u00f6del 1944 Russell's mathematical logic in Kurt G\u00f6del: Collected Works Volume II, Oxford University Press, New York, NY, .\n\nContents\n\nPart I Mathematical logic. Volume I \u27381 to \u273843\n\nThis section describes the propositional and predicate calculus, and gives the basic properties of classes, relations, and types.\n\nPart II Prolegomena to cardinal arithmetic. Volume I \u273850 to \u273897\n\nThis part covers various properties of relations, especially those needed for cardinal arithmetic.\n\nPart III Cardinal arithmetic. Volume II \u2738100 to \u2738126\n\nThis covers the definition and basic properties of cardinals. A cardinal is defined to be an equivalence class of similar classes (as opposed to ZFC, where a cardinal is a special sort of von Neumann ordinal). Each type has its own collection of cardinals associated with it, and there is a considerable amount of bookkeeping necessary for comparing cardinals of different types. PM define addition, multiplication and exponentiation of cardinals, and compare different definitions of finite and infinite cardinals. \u2738120.03 is the Axiom of infinity.\n\nPart IV Relation-arithmetic. Volume II \u2738150 to \u2738186\n\nA \"relation-number\" is an equivalence class of isomorphic relations. PM defines analogues of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation for arbitrary relations. The addition and multiplication is similar to the usual definition of addition and multiplication of ordinals in ZFC, though the definition of exponentiation of relations in PM is not equivalent to the usual one used in ZFC.\n\nPart V Series. Volume II \u2738200 to \u2738234 and volume III \u2738250 to \u2738276\n\nThis covers series, which is PM's term for what is now called a totally ordered set. In particular it covers complete series, continuous functions between series with the order topology (though of course they do not use this terminology), well-ordered series, and series without \"gaps\" (those with a member strictly between any two given members).\n\nPart VI Quantity. Volume III \u2738300 to \u2738375\n\nThis section constructs the ring of integers, the fields of rational and real numbers, and \"vector-families\", which are related to what are now called torsors over abelian groups.\n\nComparison with set theory\n\nThis section compares the system in PM with the usual mathematical foundations of ZFC. The system of PM is roughly comparable in strength with Zermelo set theory (or more precisely a version of it where the axiom of separation has all quantifiers bounded).\n\nThe system of propositional logic and predicate calculus in PM is essentially the same as that used now, except that the notation and terminology has changed.\nThe most obvious difference between PM and set theory is that in PM all objects belong to one of a number of disjoint types. This means that everything gets duplicated for each (infinite) type: for example, each type has its own ordinals, cardinals, real numbers, and so on. This results in a lot of bookkeeping to relate the various types with each other.\nIn ZFC functions are normally coded as sets of ordered pairs. In PM functions are treated rather differently. First of all, \"function\" means \"propositional function\", something taking values true or false. Second, functions are not determined by their values: it is possible to have several different functions all taking the same values (for example, one might regard 2x+2 and 2(x+1) as different functions on grounds that the computer programs for evaluating them are different). The functions in ZFC given by sets of ordered pairs correspond to what PM call \"matrices\", and the more general functions in PM are coded by quantifying over some variables. In particular PM distinguishes between functions defined using quantification and functions not defined using quantification, whereas ZFC does not make this distinction.\nPM has no analogue of the axiom of replacement, though this is of little practical importance as this axiom is used very little in mathematics outside set theory.\nPM emphasizes relations as a fundamental concept, whereas in current mathematical practice it is functions rather than relations that are treated as more fundamental; for example, category theory emphasizes morphisms or functions rather than relations. (However, there is an analogue of categories called allegories that models relations rather than functions, and is quite similar to the type system of PM.)\nIn PM, cardinals are defined as classes of similar classes, whereas in ZFC cardinals are special ordinals. In PM there is a different collection of cardinals for each type with some complicated machinery for moving cardinals between types, whereas in ZFC there is only 1 sort of cardinal. Since PM does not have any equivalent of the axiom of replacement, it is unable to prove the existence of cardinals greater than \u2135\u03c9.\nIn PM ordinals are treated as equivalence classes of well-ordered sets, and as with cardinals there is a different collection of ordinals for each type. In ZFC there is only one collection of ordinals, usually defined as von Neumann ordinals. One strange quirk of PM is that they do not have an ordinal corresponding to 1, which causes numerous unnecessary complications in their theorems. The definition of ordinal exponentiation \u03b1\u03b2 in PM is not equivalent to the usual definition in ZFC and has some rather undesirable properties: for example, it is not continuous in \u03b2 and is not well ordered (so is not even an ordinal).\nThe constructions of the integers, rationals and real numbers in ZFC have been streamlined considerably over time since the constructions in PM.\n\nDifferences between editions\n\nApart from corrections of misprints, the main text of PM is unchanged between the first and second editions.

{"title": "Projective geometry", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry", "text": "Projective geometry is a topic in mathematics. It is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations. This means that, compared to elementary geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective space, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts. The basic intuitions are that projective space has more points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called \"points at infinity\") to Euclidean points, and vice versa.\n\nProperties meaningful for projective geometry are respected by this new idea of transformation, which is more radical in its effects than can be expressed by a transformation matrix and translations (the affine transformations). The first issue for geometers is what kind of geometry is adequate for a novel situation. It is not possible to refer to angles in projective geometry as it is in Euclidean geometry, because angle is an example of a concept not invariant with respect to projective transformations, as is seen in perspective drawing. One source for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective. Another difference from elementary geometry is the way in which parallel lines can be said to meet in a point at infinity, once the concept is translated into projective geometry's terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as railway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing. See projective plane for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions.\n\nWhile the ideas were available earlier, projective geometry was mainly a development of the 19th century. This included the theory of complex projective space, the coordinates used (homogeneous coordinates) being complex numbers. Several major types of more abstract mathematics (including invariant theory, the Italian school of algebraic geometry, and Felix Klein's Erlangen programme resulting in the study of the classical groups) were based on projective geometry. It was also a subject with a large number of practitioners for its own sake, as synthetic geometry. Another topic that developed from axiomatic studies of projective geometry is finite geometry.\n\nThe topic of projective geometry is itself now divided into many research subtopics, two examples of which are projective algebraic geometry (the study of projective varieties) and projective differential geometry (the study of differential invariants of the projective transformations).\n\n Overview \nthumb|300px|right|The Fundamental Theory of Projective Geometry\nProjective geometry is an elementary non-metrical form of geometry, meaning that it is not based on a concept of distance. In two dimensions it begins with the study of configurations of points and lines. That there is indeed some geometric interest in this sparse setting was first established by Desargues and others in their exploration of the principles of perspective art.Ramanan 1997, p. 88 In higher dimensional spaces there are considered hyperplanes (that always meet), and other linear subspaces, which exhibit the principle of duality. The simplest illustration of duality is in the projective plane, where the statements \"two distinct points determine a unique line\" (i.e. the line through them) and \"two distinct lines determine a unique point\" (i.e. their point of intersection) show the same structure as propositions. Projective geometry can also be seen as a geometry of constructions with a straight-edge alone.Coxeter 2003, p. v  Since projective geometry excludes compass constructions, there are no circles, no angles, no measurements, no parallels, and no concept of intermediacy.Coxeter 1969, p. 229 It was realised that the theorems that do apply to projective geometry are simpler statements. For example, the different conic sections are all equivalent in (complex) projective geometry, and some theorems about circles can be considered as special cases of these general theorems.\n\nDuring the early 19th century the work of Jean-Victor Poncelet, Lazare Carnot and others established projective geometry as an independent field of mathematics\n.  Its rigorous foundations were addressed by Karl von Staudt and perfected by Italians Giuseppe Peano, Mario Pieri, Alessandro Padoa and Gino Fano during the late 19th century.Coxeter 2003, p. 14 Projective geometry, like affine and Euclidean geometry, can also be developed from the Erlangen program of Felix Klein; projective geometry is characterized by invariants under transformations of the projective group.\n\nAfter much work on the very large number of theorems in the subject, therefore, the basics of projective geometry became understood. The incidence structure and the cross-ratio are fundamental invariants under projective transformations. Projective geometry can be modeled by the affine plane (or affine space) plus a line (hyperplane) \"at infinity\" and then treating that line (or hyperplane) as \"ordinary\".Coxeter 1969, pp. 93, 261  An algebraic model for doing projective geometry in the style of analytic geometry is given by homogeneous coordinates.Coxeter 1969, pp. 234\u2013238Coxeter 2003, pp. 111\u2013132 On the other hand, axiomatic studies revealed the existence of non-Desarguesian planes, examples to show that the axioms of incidence can be modelled (in two dimensions only) by structures not accessible to reasoning through homogeneous coordinate systems.\nthumb|300px|right|Growth measure and the polar vortices. Based on the work of Lawrence Edwards\nIn a foundational sense, projective geometry and ordered geometry are elementary since they involve a minimum of axioms and either can be used as the foundation for affine and Euclidean geometry.Coxeter 1969, pp. 175\u2013262Coxeter 2003, pp. 102\u2013110  Projective geometry is not \"ordered\" and so it is a distinct foundation for geometry.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first geometrical properties of a projective nature were discovered during the 3rd century by Pappus of Alexandria. Filippo Brunelleschi (1404\u20131472) started investigating the geometry of perspective during 1425Coxeter 2003, p. 2 (see the history of perspective for a more thorough discussion of the work in the fine arts that motivated much of the development of projective geometry). Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) and G\u00e9rard Desargues (1591\u20131661) independently developed the concept of the \"point at infinity\".Coxeter 2003, p. 3  Desargues developed an alternative way of constructing perspective drawings by generalizing the use of vanishing points to include the case when these are infinitely far away. He made Euclidean geometry, where parallel lines are truly parallel, into a special case of an all-encompassing geometric system. Desargues's study on conic sections drew the attention of 16-year-old Blaise Pascal and helped him formulate Pascal's theorem. The works of Gaspard Monge at the end of 18th and beginning of 19th century were important for the subsequent development of projective geometry. The work of Desargues was ignored until Michel Chasles chanced upon a handwritten copy during 1845. Meanwhile, Jean-Victor Poncelet had published the foundational treatise on projective geometry during 1822.  Poncelet separated the projective properties of objects in individual class and establishing a relationship between metric and projective properties. The non-Euclidean geometries discovered soon thereafter were eventually demonstrated to have models, such as the Klein model of hyperbolic space, relating to projective geometry.\n\nThis early 19th century projective geometry was intermediate from analytic geometry to algebraic geometry. When treated in terms of homogeneous coordinates, projective geometry seems like an extension or technical improvement of the use of coordinates to reduce geometric problems to algebra, an extension reducing the number of special cases. The detailed study of quadrics and the \"line geometry\" of Julius Pl\u00fccker still form a rich set of examples for geometers working with more general concepts.\n\nThe work of Poncelet, Jakob Steiner and others was not intended to extend analytic geometry. Techniques were supposed to be synthetic: in effect projective space as now understood was to be introduced axiomatically. As a result, reformulating early work in projective geometry so that it satisfies current standards of rigor can be somewhat difficult. Even in the case of the projective plane alone, the axiomatic approach can result in models not describable via linear algebra.\n\nThis period in geometry was overtaken by research on the general algebraic curve by Clebsch, Riemann, Max Noether and others, which stretched existing techniques, and then by invariant theory. Towards the end of the century, the Italian school of algebraic geometry (Enriques, Segre, Severi) broke out of the traditional subject matter into an area demanding deeper techniques.\n\nDuring the later part of the 19th century, the detailed study of projective geometry became less fashionable, although the literature is voluminous. Some important work was done in enumerative geometry in particular, by Schubert, that is now considered as anticipating the theory of Chern classes, taken as representing the algebraic topology of Grassmannians.\n\nPaul Dirac studied projective geometry and used it as a basis for developing his concepts of quantum mechanics, although his published results were always in algebraic form. See a blog article referring to an article and a book on this subject, also to a talk Dirac gave to a general audience during 1972 in Boston about projective geometry, without specifics as to its application in his physics.\n\nDescription\nProjective geometry is less restrictive than either Euclidean geometry or affine geometry. It is an intrinsically non-metrical geometry, meaning that facts are independent of any metric structure. Under the projective transformations, the incidence structure and the relation of projective harmonic conjugates are preserved. A projective range is the one-dimensional foundation. Projective geometry formalizes one of the central principles of perspective art: that parallel lines meet at infinity, and therefore are drawn that way. In essence, a projective geometry may be thought of as an extension of Euclidean geometry in which the \"direction\" of each line is subsumed within the line as an extra \"point\", and in which a \"horizon\" of directions corresponding to coplanar lines is regarded as a \"line\". Thus, two parallel lines meet on a horizon line by virtue of their incorporating the same direction.\n\nIdealized directions are referred to as points at infinity, while idealized horizons are referred to as lines at infinity. In turn, all these lines lie in the plane at infinity. However, infinity is a metric concept, so a purely projective geometry does not single out any points, lines or planes in this regard\u2014those at infinity are treated just like any others.\n\nBecause a Euclidean geometry is contained within a projective geometry\u2014with projective geometry having a simpler foundation\u2014general results in Euclidean geometry may be derived in a more transparent manner, where separate but similar theorems of Euclidean geometry may be handled collectively within the framework of projective geometry. For example, parallel and nonparallel lines need not be treated as separate cases; rather an arbitrary projective plane is singled out as the ideal plane and located \"at infinity\" using homogeneous coordinates.\n\nAdditional properties of fundamental importance include Desargues' Theorem and the Theorem of Pappus. In projective spaces of dimension 3 or greater there is a construction that allows one to prove Desargues' Theorem. But for dimension 2, it must be separately postulated.\n\nUsing Desargues' Theorem, combined with the other axioms, it is possible to define the basic operations of arithmetic, geometrically. The resulting operations satisfy the axioms of a field \u2014 except that the commutativity of multiplication requires Pappus's hexagon theorem. As a result, the points of each line are in one-to-one correspondence with a given field, , supplemented by an additional element, \u221e, such that , , , , , , except that , , , ,  and  remain undefined.\n\nProjective geometry also includes a full theory of conic sections, a subject also extensively developed in Euclidean geometry. There are advantages to being able to think of a hyperbola and an ellipse as distinguished only by the way the hyperbola lies across the line at infinity; and that a parabola is distinguished only by being tangent to the same line. The whole family of circles can be considered as conics passing through two given points on the line at infinity \u2014 at the cost of requiring complex coordinates. Since coordinates are not \"synthetic\", one replaces them by fixing a line and two points on it, and considering the linear system of all conics passing through those points as the basic object of study. This method proved very attractive to talented geometers, and the topic was studied thoroughly. An example of this method is the multi-volume treatise by H. F. Baker.\n\nThere are many projective geometries, which may be divided into discrete and continuous: a discrete geometry comprises a set of points, which may or may not be finite in number, while a continuous geometry has infinitely many points with no gaps in between.\n\nThe only projective geometry of dimension 0 is a single point. A projective geometry of dimension 1 consists of a single line containing at least 3 points. The geometric construction of arithmetic operations cannot be performed in either of these cases. For dimension 2, there is a rich structure in virtue of the absence of Desargues' Theorem.\n\nthumb|right|The Fano plane is the projective plane with the fewest points and lines.\nAccording to Greenberg (1999) and others, the simplest 2-dimensional projective geometry is the Fano plane, which has 3 points on every line, with 7 points and 7 lines in all, having the following collinearities:\n\n [ABC]\n [ADE]\n [AFG]\n [BDG]\n [BEF]\n [CDF]\n [CEG]\n\nwith homogeneous coordinates , , , , , , , or, in affine coordinates, , , , , , and . The affine coordinates in a Desarguesian plane for the points designated to be the points at infinity (in this example: C, E and G) can be defined in several other ways.\n\nIn standard notation, a finite projective geometry is written  where:\n  is the projective (or geometric) dimension, and\n  is one less than the number of points on a line (called the order of the geometry).\n\nThus, the example having only 7 points is written .\n\nThe term \"projective geometry\" is used sometimes to indicate the generalised underlying abstract geometry, and sometimes to indicate a particular geometry of wide interest, such as the metric geometry of flat space which we analyse through the use of homogeneous coordinates, and in which Euclidean geometry may be embedded (hence its name, Extended Euclidean plane).\n\nThe fundamental property that singles out all projective geometries is the elliptic incidence property that any two distinct lines  and  in the projective plane intersect at exactly one point . The special case in analytic geometry of parallel lines is subsumed in the smoother form of a line at infinity on which  lies. The line at infinity is thus a line like any other in the theory: it is in no way special or distinguished. (In the later spirit of the Erlangen programme one could point to the way the group of transformations can move any line to the line at infinity).\n\nThe parallel properties of elliptic, Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries contrast as follows:\n\n Given a line  and a point  not on the line,\n Elliptic     there exists no line through  that does not meet \n Euclidean    there exists exactly one line through  that does not meet \n Hyperbolic    there exists more than one line through  that does not meet \n\nThe parallel property of elliptic geometry is the key idea that leads to the principle of projective duality, possibly the most important property that all projective geometries have in common.\n\nDuality\n\nIn 1825, Joseph Gergonne noted the principle of duality characterizing projective plane geometry: given any theorem or definition of that geometry, substituting point for line, lie on for pass through, collinear for concurrent, intersection for join, or vice versa, results in another theorem or valid definition, the \"dual\" of the first. Similarly in 3 dimensions, the duality relation holds between points and planes, allowing any theorem to be transformed by swapping point and plane, is contained by and contains. More generally, for projective spaces of dimension N, there is a duality between the subspaces of dimension R and dimension N\u2212R\u22121. For N = 2, this specializes to the most commonly known form of duality\u2014that between points and lines.\nThe duality principle was also discovered independently by Jean-Victor Poncelet.\n\nTo establish duality only requires establishing theorems which are the dual versions of the axioms for the dimension in question. Thus, for 3-dimensional spaces, one needs to show that (1*) every point lies in 3 distinct planes, (2*) every two planes intersect in a unique line and a dual version of (3*) to the effect: if the intersection of plane P and Q is coplanar with the intersection of plane R and S, then so are the respective intersections of planes P and R, Q and S (assuming planes P and S are distinct from Q and R).\n\nIn practice, the principle of duality allows us to set up a dual correspondence between two geometric constructions. The most famous of these is the polarity or reciprocity of two figures in a conic curve (in 2 dimensions) or a quadric surface (in 3 dimensions). A commonplace example is found in the reciprocation of a symmetrical polyhedron in a concentric sphere to obtain the dual polyhedron.\n\nAnother example is Brianchon's theorem, the dual of the already mentioned Pascal's theorem, and one of whose proofs simply consists of applying the principle of duality to Pascal's. Here are comparative statements of these two theorems (in both cases within the framework of the projective plane):\n Pascal: If all six vertices of a hexagon lie on a conic, then the intersections of its opposite sides (regarded as full lines, since in the projective plane there is no such thing as a \"line segment\") are three collinear points. The line joining them is then called the Pascal line of the hexagon.\n Brianchon: If all six sides of a hexagon are tangent to a conic, then its diagonals (i.e. the lines joining opposite vertices) are three concurrent lines. Their point of intersection is then called the Brianchon point of the hexagon.\n (If the conic degenerates into two straight lines, Pascal's becomes Pappus's theorem, which has no interesting dual, since the Brianchon point trivially becomes the two lines' intersection point.)\n\nAxioms of projective geometry\nAny given geometry may be deduced from an appropriate set of axioms. Projective geometries are characterised by the \"elliptic parallel\" axiom, that any two planes always meet in just one line, or in the plane, any two lines always meet in just one point. In other words, there are no such things as parallel lines or planes in projective geometry.  \n\nMany alternative sets of axioms for projective geometry have been proposed (see for example Coxeter 2003, Hilbert & Cohn-Vossen 1999, Greenberg 1980).\n\nWhitehead's axioms\nThese axioms are based on Whitehead, \"The Axioms of Projective Geometry\". There are two types, points and lines, and one \"incidence\" relation between points and lines. The three axioms are:\n G1: Every line contains at least 3 points\n G2: Every two distinct points, A and B, lie on a unique line, AB.\n G3: If lines AB and CD intersect, then so do lines AC and BD (where it is assumed that A and D are distinct from B and C).\n\nThe reason each line is assumed to contain at least 3 points is to eliminate some degenerate cases. The spaces satisfying these\nthree axioms either have at most one line, or are projective spaces of some dimension over a division ring, or are non-Desarguesian planes.\n\nAdditional axioms\nOne can add further axioms restricting the dimension or the coordinate ring. For example, Coxeter's Projective Geometry,Coxeter 2003, pp. 14\u201315 references VeblenVeblen 1966, pp. 16, 18, 24, 45 in the three axioms above, together with a further 5 axioms that make the dimension 3 and the coordinate ring a commutative field of characteristic not\u00a02.\n\nAxioms using a ternary relation\nOne can pursue axiomatization by postulating a ternary relation, [ABC] to denote when three points (not all necessarily distinct) are collinear. An axiomatization may be written down in terms of this relation as well:\n C0: [ABA]\n C1: If A and B are two points such that [ABC] and [ABD] then [BDC]\n C2: If A and B are two points then there is a third point C such that [ABC]\n C3: If A and C are two points, B and D also, with [BCE], [ADE] but not [ABE] then there is a point F such that [ACF] and [BDF].\nFor two different points, A and B, the line AB is defined as consisting of all points C for which [ABC]. The axioms C0 and C1 then provide a formalization of G2; C2 for G1 and C3 for G3.\n\nThe concept of line generalizes to planes and higher-dimensional subspaces. A subspace, AB\u2026XY may thus be recursively defined in terms of the subspace AB\u2026X as that containing all the points of all lines YZ, as Z ranges over AB\u2026X. Collinearity then generalizes to the relation of \"independence\". A set {A, B, \u2026, Z} of points is independent, [AB\u2026Z] if {A, B, \u2026, Z} is a minimal generating subset for the subspace AB\u2026Z.\n\nThe projective axioms may be supplemented by further axioms postulating limits on the dimension of the space. The minimum dimension is determined by the existence of an independent set of the required size. For the lowest dimensions, the relevant conditions may be stated in equivalent\nform as follows. A projective space is of:\n (L1) at least dimension 0 if it has at least 1 point,\n (L2) at least dimension 1 if it has at least 2 distinct points (and therefore a line),\n (L3) at least dimension 2 if it has at least 3 non-collinear points (or two lines, or a line and a point not on the line),\n (L4) at least dimension 3 if it has at least 4 non-coplanar points.\n\nThe maximum dimension may also be determined in a similar fashion. For the lowest dimensions, they take on the following forms. A projective space is of:\n (M1) at most dimension 0 if it has no more than 1 point,\n (M2) at most dimension 1 if it has no more than 1 line,\n (M3) at most dimension 2 if it has no more than 1 plane,\nand so on. It is a general theorem (a consequence of axiom (3)) that all coplanar lines intersect\u2014the very principle Projective Geometry was originally intended to embody. Therefore, property (M3) may be equivalently stated that all lines intersect one another.\n\nIt is generally assumed that projective spaces are of at least dimension 2. In some cases, if the focus is on projective planes, a variant of M3 may be postulated. The axioms of (Eves 1997: 111), for instance, include (1), (2), (L3) and (M3). Axiom (3) becomes vacuously true under (M3) and is therefore not needed in this context.\n\nAxioms for projective planes\n\nIn incidence geometry, most authors, , , , , , ,  and  among the references given. give a treatment that embraces the Fano plane PG(2,\u00a02) as the smallest finite projective plane.  An axiom system that achieves this is as follows:\n (P1) Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.\n (P2) Any two distinct lines meet in a unique point.\n (P3) There exist at least four points of which no three are collinear.\n\nCoxeter's Introduction to GeometryCoxeter 1969, pp. 229\u2013234 gives a list of five axioms for a more restrictive concept of a projective plane attributed to Bachmann, adding Pappus's theorem to the list of axioms above (which eliminates non-Desarguesian planes) and excluding projective planes over fields of characteristic 2 (those that don't satisfy Fano's axiom). The restricted planes given in this manner more closely resemble the real projective plane.\n\nSee also\n\nProjective line\nProjective plane\nProjective space\nIncidence\nCross-ratio\nM\u00f6bius transformation\nProjective transformation\nHomogeneous coordinates\nDuality (projective geometry)\nFundamental theorem of projective geometry\nProjective configuration\nComplete quadrangle\nDesargues' theorem\nPappus's hexagon theorem\nPascal's theorem\nProjective line over a ring\nJoseph Wedderburn\nGrassmann\u2013Cayley algebra\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n F.

A theory is a set of well-formed formulas with no free variables.\n\nA theory is consistent if there is no formula  such that both  and its negation are provable.  \u03c9-consistency is a stronger property than consistency.  Suppose that  is a formula with one free variable .  In order to be \u03c9-consistent,  the theory cannot prove both  while also proving  for each natural number .\n\nThe theory is assumed to be effective, which means that the set of axioms must be recursively enumerable.  This means that it is theoretically possible to write a finite-length computer program that, if allowed to run forever, would output the axioms of the theory (necessarily including every well-formed instance of the axiom schema of induction) one at a time and not output anything else. This requirement is necessary; there are theories that are complete, consistent, and include elementary arithmetic, but no such theory can be effective.\n\n Outline of the proof \n\n For a simplified outline of the proof, see G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems\n\nThe sketch here is broken into three parts.  In the first part, each formula of the theory is assigned a number, known as a G\u00f6del number, in a manner that allows the formula to be effectively recovered from the number. This numbering is extended to cover finite sequences of formulas. In the second part, a specific formula  is constructed such that for any two numbers  and  holds if and only if  represents a sequence of formulas that constitutes a proof of the formula that  represents.  In the third part of the proof, we construct a self-referential formula that, informally, says \"I am not provable\", and prove that this sentence is neither provable nor disprovable within the theory.\n\nImportantly, all the formulas in the proof can be defined by primitive recursive functions, which themselves can be defined in first-order Peano arithmetic.\n\n G\u00f6del numbering \n\nThe first step of the proof is to represent (well-formed) formulas of the theory, and finite lists of these formulas, as natural numbers. These numbers are called the G\u00f6del numbers of the formulas.\n\nBegin by assigning a natural number to each symbol of the language of arithmetic, similar to the manner in which the ASCII code assigns a unique binary number to each letter and certain other characters. This article will employ the following assignment, very similar to the one Douglas Hofstadter used in his G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach:\n\n Number  Symbol  Meaning 666  0  zero 123    successor function 111  =  equality relation 212  <  less than relation 112  +  addition operator 236  \u2715  multiplication operator 362  (  left parenthesis 323  )  right parenthesis Number  Symbol  Meaning 262    a variable name 163  *  star (used to make more variables) 333  \u2203  existential quantifier 626  \u2200  for all 161  \u2227  logical and 616  \u2228  logical or 223  \u00ac  logical not\n\nThe G\u00f6del number of a formula is obtained by concatenating the G\u00f6del numbers of each symbol making up the formula. The G\u00f6del numbers for each symbol are separated by a zero because by design, no G\u00f6del number of a symbol includes a . Hence any formula may be correctly recovered from its G\u00f6del number. Let  denote the G\u00f6del number of the formula .\n\nGiven the above G\u00f6del numbering, the sentence asserting that addition commutes,  translates as the number:\n\n \n\n(Spaces have been inserted on each side of every 0 only for readability; G\u00f6del numbers are strict concatenations of decimal digits.)  Not all natural numbers represent a formula. For example, the number\n\n \n\ntranslates to \"\", which is not well-formed.\n\nBecause each natural number can be obtained by applying the successor operation  to  a finite number of times, every natural number has its own G\u00f6del number. For example, the G\u00f6del number corresponding to , is:\n\n .\n\nThe assignment of G\u00f6del numbers can be extended to finite lists of formulas. To obtain the G\u00f6del number of a list of formulas, write the G\u00f6del numbers of the formulas in order, separating them by two consecutive zeros. Since the G\u00f6del number of a formula never contains two consecutive zeros, each formula in a list of formulas can be effectively recovered from the G\u00f6del number for the list.\n\nIt is crucial that the formal arithmetic be capable of proving a minimum set of facts. In particular, it must be able to prove that every number  has a G\u00f6del number . A second fact that the theory must prove is that given any G\u00f6del number  of a formula  with one free variable  and any number , there is a G\u00f6del number of the formula  obtained by replacing all occurrences of  in  with , and that this second G\u00f6del number can be effectively obtained from the G\u00f6del number  of  as a function of . To see that this is in fact possible, note that given the G\u00f6del number of , one can recreate the original formula , make the substitution of  with , and then find the G\u00f6del number  of the resulting formula . This is a uniform procedure.\n\n The provability relation \n\nDeduction rules can then be represented by binary relations on G\u00f6del numbers of lists of formulas.  In other words, suppose that there is a deduction rule , by which one can move from the formulas  to a new formula .  Then the relation  corresponding to this deduction rule says that  is related to  (in other words,  holds) if  is the G\u00f6del number of the list of formulas containing  and  and  is the G\u00f6del number of the list of formulas consisting of those in the list coded by  together with .  Because each deduction rule is concrete, it is possible to effectively determine for any natural numbers  and  whether they are related by the relation.\n\nThe second stage in the proof is to use the G\u00f6del numbering, described above, to show that the notion of provability can be expressed within the formal language of the theory. Suppose the theory has deduction rules:  . Let  be their corresponding relations, as described above.\n\nEvery provable statement is either an axiom itself, or it can be deduced from the axioms by a finite number of applications of the deduction rules. \nA proof of a formula  is itself a string of mathematical statements related by  particular relations (each is either an axiom or related to former statements by deduction rules), where the last statement is . Thus one can define the G\u00f6del number of a proof. Moreover, one may define a statement form , which for every two numbers  and  is provable if and only if  is the G\u00f6del number of a proof of the statement  and .\n\n is in fact an arithmetical relation, just as \"\" is, though a (much) more complicated one. Given such a relation , for any two specific numbers  and , either the formula , or its negation , but not both, is provable. This is because the relation between these two numbers can be simply \"checked\". Formally this can be proven by induction, where all these possible relations (whose number is infinite) are constructed one by one.\nThe detailed construction of the formula  makes essential use of the assumption that the theory is effective; it would not be possible to construct this formula without such an assumption.\n\n Self-referential formula \n\nFor every number  and every formula , where  is a free variable,  we define , a relation between two numbers  and , such  that it corresponds to the statement \" is not the G\u00f6del number of a proof of \". Here,  can be understood as  with its own G\u00f6del number as its argument.\n\nNote that  takes as an argument , the G\u00f6del number of . In order to prove either , or , it is necessary to perform number-theoretic operations on  that mirror the following steps: decode the number  into the formula , replace all occurrences of  in  with the number , and then compute the G\u00f6del number of the resulting formula .\n\nNote that for every specific number  and formula  is a straightforward (though complicated) arithmetical relation between two numbers  and , building on the relation  defined earlier. Further,   is provable if the finite list of formulas encoded by  is not a proof of , and  is provable if the finite list of formulas encoded by  is a proof of . Given any numbers  and , either  or  (but not both) is provable.\n\nAny proof of  can be encoded by a G\u00f6del number , such that  does not hold. If  holds for all natural numbers , then there is no proof of . In other words,  , a formula about natural numbers, corresponds to \"there is no proof of \".\n\nWe now define the formula , where  is a free variable. The formula  itself has a G\u00f6del number  as does every formula.\n\nThis formula has a free variable . Suppose we replace it with ,\nthe G\u00f6del number of a formula , where  is a free variable. Then,  corresponds to \"there is no proof of \", as we have seen.\n\nConsider the formula . This formula concerning the number  corresponds to \"there is no proof of \". We have here the self-referential feature that is crucial to the proof: A formula of the formal theory that somehow relates to its own provability within that formal theory. Very informally,  says: \"I am not provable\".\n\nWe will now show that neither the formula , nor its negation ,  is provable.\n\nSuppose  is provable. Let  be the G\u00f6del number of a proof of . Then, as seen earlier, the formula   is provable. Proving both  and  violates the consistency of the formal theory. We therefore conclude that  is not provable.\n\nConsider any number . Suppose  is provable.\nThen,  must be the G\u00f6del number of a proof of . But we have just proved that  is not provable. Since either  or  must be provable, we conclude that, for all natural numbers  is provable.\n\nSuppose the negation of , , is provable. Proving both , and , for all natural numbers , violates  \u03c9-consistency of the formal theory. Thus if the theory is \u03c9-consistent,  is not provable.\n\nWe have sketched a proof showing that:\n\nFor any formal, recursively enumerable (i.e. effectively generated) theory of Peano Arithmetic,\n\n if it is consistent, then there exists an unprovable formula (in the language of that theory).\n\n if it is \u03c9-consistent, then there exists a formula such that both it and its negation are unprovable.\n\n The truth of the G\u00f6del sentence \n\nThe proof of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem just sketched is proof-theoretic (also called syntactic) in that it shows that if certain proofs exist (a proof of  or its negation) then they can be manipulated to produce a proof of a contradiction.  This makes no appeal to whether  is \"true\", only to whether it is provable. Truth is a model-theoretic, or semantic, concept, and is not equivalent to provability except in special cases.\n\nBy analyzing the situation of the above proof in more detail, it is possible to obtain a conclusion about the truth of  in the standard model \u2115 of natural numbers. As just seen,  is provable for each natural number , and is thus true in the model \u2115. Therefore, within this model,\n\n \n\nholds. This is what the statement \" is true\" usually refers to\u2014the sentence is true in the intended model.  It is not true in every model, however: If it were, then by G\u00f6del's completeness theorem it would be provable, which we have just seen is not the case.\n\n Boolos's short proof \n\nGeorge Boolos (1989) vastly simplified the proof of the First Theorem, if one agrees that the theorem is equivalent to:\n\"There is no algorithm  whose output contains all true sentences of arithmetic and no false ones.\"\n\"Arithmetic\" refers to Peano or Robinson arithmetic, but the proof invokes no specifics of either, tacitly assuming that these systems allow '<' and '\u00d7' to have their usual meanings. Boolos proves the theorem in about two pages. His proof employs the language of first-order logic, but invokes no facts about the connectives or quantifiers. The domain of discourse is the natural numbers. The G\u00f6del sentence builds on Berry's paradox.\n\nLet  abbreviate  successive applications of the successor function, starting from . Boolos then asserts (the details are only sketched) that there exists a defined predicate  that comes out true iff an arithmetic formula containing  symbols names the number . This proof sketch contains the only mention of G\u00f6del numbering; Boolos merely assumes that every formula can be so numbered. Here, a formula names the number  iff the following is provable:\n\n \n\nBoolos then defines the related predicates:\n\n . (English:  comes out true if  can be defined in fewer than  symbols):\n . (English:  comes out true if  is the smallest number not definable in fewer than  symbols. More awkwardly,  holds if  cannot be defined in fewer than  symbols, and all numbers less than  can be defined using fewer than  symbols);\n . the number of symbols appearing in .\n\n formalizes Berry's paradox. The balance of the proof, requiring but 12 lines of text, shows that the sentence  is true for some number , but no algorithm  will identify it as true. Hence in arithmetic, truth outruns proof. QED.\n\nThe above predicates contain the only existential quantifiers appearing in the entire proof. The '<' and '\u00d7' appearing in these predicates are the only defined arithmetical notions the proof requires. The proof nowhere mentions recursive functions or any facts from number theory, and Boolos claims that his proof dispenses with diagonalization. For more on this proof, see Berry's paradox.\n\n References \n 1931, \"\u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I.\" Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik 38: 173\u201398.\n English translations of the preceding:\n Jean van Heijenoort, 1967.

These proofs are used in the article Addition of natural numbers.\n\nDefinitions\nThis article will use the Peano axioms for the definitions of addition of the natural numbers, and the successor function S(a). In particular:\n\n A1:  a + 0 = a A2:  a + S(b) = S(a + b)\n\nFor the proof of commutativity, it is useful to define another natural number closely related to the successor function, namely \"1\". We define 1 to be the successor of 0, in other words,\n\n1 = S(0).\n\nNote that for all natural numbers a,\n\n  S(a)  =  S(a + 0)  [by A1] =  a + S(0)  [by A2] =  a + 1  [by Def. of 1]\n\n Proof of associativity \n\nWe prove associativity by first fixing natural numbers a and b and applying induction on the natural number c.\n\nFor the base case c = 0,\n\n (a+b)+0 = a+b = a+(b+0)\n\nEach equation follows by definition [A1]; the first with a + b, the second with b.\n\nNow, for the induction. We assume the induction hypothesis, namely we assume that for some natural number c,\n\n (a+b)+c = a+(b+c)\n\nThen it follows,\n\n  (a + b) + S(c) =  S((a + b) + c)  [by A2] =  S(a + (b + c))  [by the induction hypothesis]  =  a + S(b + c)  [by A2] =  a + (b + S(c))  [by A2]\n\nIn other words, the induction hypothesis holds for S(c). Therefore, the induction on c is complete.\n\n Proof of identity element \n\nDefinition [A1] states directly that 0 is a right identity.\nWe prove that 0 is a left identity by induction on the natural number a.\n\nFor the base case a = 0, 0 + 0 = 0 by definition [A1].\nNow we assume the induction hypothesis, that 0 + a = a.\nThen\n  0 + S(a) =  S(0 + a)  [by A2] =  S(a)  [by the induction hypothesis]\nThis completes the induction on a.\n\n Proof of commutativity \n\nWe prove commutativity (a + b = b + a) by applying induction on the natural number b. First we prove the base cases b = 0 and b = S(0) = 1 (i.e. we prove that 0 and 1 commute with everything).\n\nThe base case b = 0 follows immediately from the identity element property (0 is an additive identity), which has been proved above:\na + 0 = a = 0 + a.\n\nNext we will prove the base case b = 1, that 1 commutes with everything, i.e. for all natural numbers a, we have a + 1 = 1 + a. We will prove this by induction on a (an induction proof within an induction proof). We have proved that 0 commutes with everything, so in particular, 0 commutes with 1: for a = 0, we have 0 + 1 = 1 + 0. Now, suppose a + 1 = 1 + a. Then\n\n  S(a) + 1 =  S(a) + S(0)  [by Def. of 1] =  S(S(a) + 0)  [by A2] =  S((a + 1) + 0)  [as shown above] =  S(a + 1)  [by A1] =  S(1 + a)  [by the induction hypothesis] =  1 + S(a)  [by A2]\n\nThis completes the induction on a, and so we have proved the base case b = 1. Now, suppose that for all natural numbers a, we have a + b = b + a. We must show that for all natural numbers a, we have a + S(b) = S(b) + a. We have\n\n  a + S(b) =  a + (b + 1)  [as shown above] =  (a + b) + 1  [by associativity] =  (b + a) + 1  [by the induction hypothesis] =  b + (a + 1)  [by associativity] =  b + (1 + a)  [by the base case b = 1] =  (b + 1) + a  [by associativity] =  S(b) + a  [as shown above]\n\nThis completes the induction on b.\n\n See also\nBinary operation\nProof\nRing\n\n References \n\nEdmund Landau, Foundations of Analysis, Chelsea Pub Co. .\n\nCategory:Article proofs\nCategory:Abstract algebra\nCategory:Elementary algebra\nCategory:Binary operations"}

{"title": "Scott\u2013Potter set theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%E2%80%93Potter_set_theory", "text": "An approach to the foundations of mathematics that is of relatively recent origin, Scott\u2013Potter set theory is a collection of nested axiomatic set theories set out by the philosopher Michael Potter, building on earlier work by the mathematician Dana Scott and the philosopher George Boolos.\n\nPotter (1990, 2004) clarified and simplified the approach of Scott (1974), and showed how the resulting axiomatic set theory can do what is expected of such theory, namely grounding the cardinal and ordinal numbers, Peano arithmetic and the other usual number systems, and the theory of relations.\n\nZU etc.\n\nPreliminaries\nThis section and the next follow Part I of Potter (2004) closely. The background logic is first-order logic with identity. The ontology includes urelements as well as sets, which makes it clear that there can be sets of entities defined by first-order theories not based on sets. The urelements are not essential in that other mathematical structures can be defined as sets, and it is permissible for the set of urelements to be empty.\n\nSome terminology peculiar to Potter's set theory:\n \u03b9 is a definite description operator and binds a variable. (In Potter's notation the iota symbol is inverted.)\n The predicate U holds for all urelements (non-collections).\n \u03b9x\u03a6(x) exists iff (\u2203!x)\u03a6(x). (Potter uses \u03a6 and other upper-case Greek letters to represent formulas.)\n {x : \u03a6(x)} is an abbreviation for  \u03b9y(not U(y) and (\u2200x)(x \u2208 y \u21d4 \u03a6(x))). \n a is a collection if {x : x\u2208a} exists. (All sets are collections, but not all collections are sets.)\n The accumulation of a, acc(a), is the set {x : x is an urelement or \u2203b\u2208a (x\u2208b or x\u2282b)}.\n If \u2200v\u2208V(v = acc(V\u2229v)) then V is a history.\n A level is the accumulation of a history.\n An initial level has no other levels as members. \n A limit level is a level that is neither the initial level nor the level above any other level. \n A set is a subcollection of some level.\n The birthday of set a, denoted V(a), is the lowest level V such that a\u2282V.\n\nAxioms\nThe following three axioms define the theory ZU.\n\nCreation: \u2200V\u2203V' (V\u2208V' ).\n\nRemark: There is no highest level, hence there are infinitely many levels. This axiom establishes the ontology of levels.\n\nSeparation: An axiom schema. For any first-order formula \u03a6(x) with (bound) variables ranging over the level V, the collection {x\u2208V : \u03a6(x)} is also a set.  (See Axiom schema of separation.)\n\nRemark: Given the levels established by Creation, this schema establishes the existence of sets and how to form them. It tells us that  a level is a set, and all subsets, definable via first-order logic, of levels are also sets. This schema can be seen as an extension of the background logic.\n\nInfinity: There exists at least one limit level.  (See Axiom of infinity.)\n\nRemark: Among the sets Separation allows, at least one is infinite. This axiom is primarily mathematical, as there is no need for the actual infinite in other human contexts, the human sensory order being necessarily finite. For mathematical purposes, the axiom \"There exists an inductive set\" would suffice.\n\nFurther existence premises\nThe following statements, while in the nature of axioms, are not axioms of ZU. Instead, they assert the existence of sets satisfying a stated condition. As such, they are \"existence premises,\" meaning the following. Let X denote any statement below. Any theorem whose proof requires X is then formulated conditionally as \"If X holds, then...\" Potter defines several systems using existence premises, including the following two:\n ZfU =df  ZU + Ordinals;\n ZFU =df   Separation + Reflection.\n\nOrdinals: For each (infinite) ordinal \u03b1, there exists a corresponding level V\u03b1.\n\nRemark: In words, \"There exists a level corresponding to each infinite ordinal.\" Ordinals makes possible the conventional Von Neumann definition of ordinal numbers. \n\nLet \u03c4(x) be a first-order term.\n\nReplacement:  An axiom schema. For any collection a, \u2200x\u2208a[\u03c4(x) is a set] \u2192 {\u03c4(x) : x\u2208a} is a set.\n\nRemark: If the term \u03c4(x) is a function (call it f(x)), and if the domain of f is a set, then the range of f is also a set.\n\nReflection: Let \u03a6 denote a first-order formula in which any number of free variables are present. Let \u03a6(V) denote \u03a6 with these free variables all quantified, with the quantified variables restricted to the level V.\n\nThen \u2203V[\u03a6\u2192\u03a6(V)] is an axiom.\n\nRemark: This schema asserts the existence of a \"partial\" universe, namely the level V, in which all properties \u03a6 holding when the quantified variables range over all levels, also hold when these variables range over V only. Reflection turns Creation, Infinity, Ordinals, and Replacement into theorems (Potter 2004: \u00a713.3).\n\nLet A and a denote sequences of nonempty sets, each indexed by n.\n\nCountable Choice: Given any sequence A, there exists a sequence a such that:\n\u2200n\u2208\u03c9[an\u2208An].\n\nRemark. Countable Choice enables proving that any set must be one of finite or infinite.\n\nLet B and C denote sets, and let n index the members of B, each denoted Bn.\n\nChoice: Let the members of B be disjoint nonempty sets. Then:\n\u2203C\u2200n[C\u2229Bn is a singleton].\n\nDiscussion\nThe Von Neumann universe implements the \"iterative conception of set\" by stratifying the universe of sets into a series of \"levels,\" with the sets at a given level being the members of the sets making up the next higher level. Hence the levels form a nested and well-ordered sequence, and would form a hierarchy if set membership were transitive. The resulting iterative conception steers clear, in a well-motivated way, of the well-known paradoxes of Russell, Burali-Forti, and Cantor. These paradoxes all result from the unrestricted use of the principle of comprehension that naive set theory allows. Collections such as \"the class of all sets\" or \"the class of all ordinals\" include sets from all levels of the hierarchy. Given the iterative conception, such collections cannot form sets at any given level of the hierarchy and thus cannot be sets at all. The iterative conception has gradually become more accepted over time, despite an imperfect understanding of its historical origins.\n\nBoolos's (1989) axiomatic treatment of the iterative conception is his set theory  S, a two sorted first order theory involving sets and levels.\n\nScott's theory\nScott (1974) did not mention the \"iterative conception of set,\" instead proposing his theory as a natural outgrowth of the simple theory of types. Nevertheless, Scott's theory can be seen as an axiomatization of the iterative conception and the associated iterative hierarchy.\n\nScott began with an axiom he declined to name: the atomic formula x\u2208y implies that y is a set. In symbols:\n\u2200x,y\u2203a[x\u2208y\u2192y=a].\nHis axiom of Extensionality and axiom schema of Comprehension (Separation) are strictly analogous to their ZF counterparts and so do not mention levels. He then invoked two axioms that do mention levels:\n Accumulation. A given level \"accumulates\" all members and subsets of all earlier levels. See the above definition of accumulation.\n Restriction. All collections belong to some level.\nRestriction also implies the existence of at least one level and assures that all sets are well-founded.\n\nScott's final axiom, the Reflection schema, is identical to the above existence premise bearing the same name, and likewise does duty for ZF's Infinity and Replacement. Scott's system has the same strength as ZF.\n\nPotter's theory\nPotter (1990, 2004) introduced the idiosyncratic terminology described earlier in this entry, and discarded or replaced all of Scott's axioms except Reflection; the result is ZU. ZU, like ZF, cannot be finitely axiomatized. ZU differs from ZFC in that it:\n Includes no axiom of extensionality because the usual extensionality principle follows from the definition of collection and an easy lemma.\n Admits nonwellfounded collections. However Potter (2004) never invokes such collections, and all sets (collections which are contained in a level) are wellfounded. No theorem in Potter would be overturned if an axiom stating that all collections are sets were added to ZU.\nIncludes no equivalents of Choice or the axiom schema of Replacement.\n\nHence ZU is closer to the Zermelo set theory of 1908, namely ZFC minus Choice, Replacement, and Foundation. It is stronger than this theory, however, since cardinals and ordinals can be defined, despite the absence of Choice, using Scott's trick and the existence of levels, and no such definition is possible in Zermelo set theory. Thus in ZU, an equivalence class of:\nEquinumerous sets from a common level is a cardinal number;\n Isomorphic well-orderings, also from a common level, is an ordinal number.\n\nSimilarly the natural numbers are not defined as a particular set within the iterative hierarchy, but as models of a \"pure\" Dedekind algebra. \"Dedekind algebra\" is Potter's name for a set closed under a unary injective operation, successor, whose domain contains a unique element, zero, absent from its range. Because the theory of Dedekind algebras is categorical (all models are isomorphic), any such algebra can proxy for the natural numbers.\n\nAlthough Potter (2004) devotes an entire appendix to proper classes, the strength and merits of Scott\u2013Potter set theory relative to the well-known rivals to ZFC that admit proper classes, namely NBG and Morse\u2013Kelley set theory, have yet to be explored.\n\nScott\u2013Potter set theory resembles NFU in that the latter is a recently (Jensen 1967) devised axiomatic set theory admitting both urelements and sets that are not well-founded. But the urelements of NFU, unlike those of ZU, play an essential role; they and the resulting restrictions on Extensionality make possible a proof of NFU's consistency relative to Peano arithmetic. But nothing is known about the strength of NFU relative to Creation+Separation, NFU+Infinity relative to ZU, and of NFU+Infinity+Countable Choice relative to ZU + Countable Choice.\n\nUnlike nearly all writing on set theory in recent decades, Potter (2004) mentions mereological fusions. His collections are also synonymous with the \"virtual sets\" of Willard Quine and Richard Milton Martin: entities arising from the free use of the principle of comprehension that can never be admitted to the universe of discourse.\n\nSee also\nFoundation of mathematics\nHierarchy (mathematics)\nList of set theory topics\nPhilosophy of mathematics\nS (Boolos 1989)\nVon Neumann universe\nZermelo set theory\nZFC\n\nReferences\nGeorge Boolos, 1971, \"The iterative conception of set,\" Journal of Philosophy 68: 215\u201331.

{"title": "Second-order logic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_logic", "text": "In logic and mathematics second-order logic is an extension of first-order logic, which itself is an extension of propositional logic.Shapiro (1991) and Hinman (2005) give complete introductions to the subject, with full definitions. Second-order logic is in turn extended by higher-order logic and type theory.\n\nFirst-order logic quantifies only variables that range over individuals (elements of the domain of discourse); second-order logic, in addition, also quantifies over relations. For example, the second-order sentence  says that for every unary relation (or set) P of individuals, and every individual x, either x is in P or it is not (this is the principle of bivalence). Second-order logic also includes quantification over sets, functions, and other variables as explained in the section Syntax and fragments. Both first-order and second-order logic use the idea of a domain of discourse (often called simply the \"domain\" or the \"universe\"). The domain is a set over which individual elements may be quantified.\n\nSyntax and fragments\n\nThe syntax of second-order logic tells which expressions are well formed formulas. In addition to the syntax of first-order logic, second-order logic includes many new sorts (sometimes called types) of variables. These are:\n A sort of variables that range over sets of individuals. If S is a variable of this sort and t is a first-order term then the expression t \u2208 S (also written S(t), or St to save parentheses) is an atomic formula. Sets of individuals can also be viewed as unary relations on the domain.\n For each natural number k there is a sort of variables that ranges over all k-ary relations on the individuals. If R is such a k-ary relation variable and t1,...,tk are first-order terms then the expression R(t1,...,tk) is an atomic formula.\n For each natural number k there is a sort of variables that ranges over all functions taking k elements of the domain and returning a single element of the domain. If f is such a k-ary function variable and t1,...,tk are first-order terms then the expression f(t1,...,tk) is a first-order term.\nEach of the variables just defined may be universally and/or existentially quantified over, to build up formulas. Thus there are many kinds of quantifiers, two for each sort of variables. A sentence in second-order logic, as in first-order logic, is a well-formed formula with no free variables (of any sort).\n\nIt's possible to forgo the introduction of function variables in the definition given above (and some authors do this) because an n-ary function variable can be represented by a relation variable of arity n+1 and an appropriate formula for the uniqueness of the \"result\" in the n+1 argument of the relation. (Shapiro 2000, p.\u00a063)\n\nMonadic second-order logic (MSO) is a restriction of second-order logic in which only quantification over unary relations (i.e. sets) is allowed. Quantification over functions, owing to the equivalence to relations as described above, is thus also not allowed. The second-order logic without these restrictions is sometimes called full second-order logic to distinguish it from the monadic version. Monadic second-order logic is particularly used in the context of Courcelle's theorem, an algorithmic meta-theorem in graph theory.\n\nJust as in first-order logic, second-order logic may include non-logical symbols in a particular second-order language. These are restricted, however, in that all terms that they form must be either first-order terms (which can be substituted for a first-order variable) or second-order terms (which can be substituted for a second-order variable of an appropriate sort).\n\nA formula in second-order logic is said to be of first-order (and sometimes denoted  or ) if its quantifiers (which may be of either type) range only over variables of first order, although it may have free variables of second order. A  (existential second-order) formula is one additionally having some existential quantifiers over second order variables, i.e. , where  is a first-order formula. The fragment of second order logic consisting only of existential second-order formulas is called existential second-order logic and abbreviated as ESO, as , or even as \u2203SO. The fragment of  formulas is defined dually, it is called universal second-order logic. More expressive fragments are defined for any k > 0 by mutual recursion:  has the form , where  is a  formula, and similar,  has the form , where  is a  formula. (See analytical hierarchy for the analogous construction of second-order arithmetic.)\n\nSemantics\nThe semantics of second-order logic establish the meaning of each sentence. Unlike first-order logic, which has only one standard semantics, there are two different semantics that are commonly used for second-order logic: standard semantics and Henkin semantics. In each of these semantics, the interpretations of the first-order quantifiers and the logical connectives are the same as in first-order logic. Only the ranges of quantifiers over second-order variables differ in the two types of semantics (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2001).\n\nIn standard semantics, also called full semantics, the quantifiers range over all sets or functions of the appropriate sort. Thus once the domain of the first-order variables is established, the meaning of the remaining quantifiers is fixed. It is these semantics that give second-order logic its expressive power, and they will be assumed for the remainder of this article.\n\nIn Henkin semantics, each sort of second-order variable has a particular domain of its own to range over, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions of that sort. Leon Henkin (1950) defined these semantics and proved that G\u00f6del's completeness theorem and compactness theorem, which hold for first-order logic, carry over to second-order logic with Henkin semantics. This is because Henkin semantics are almost identical to many-sorted first-order semantics, where additional sorts of variables are added to simulate the new variables of second-order logic. Second-order logic with Henkin semantics is not more expressive than first-order logic. Henkin semantics are commonly used in the study of second-order arithmetic.\n\nV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (2001) argued that the choice between Henkin models and full models for second-order logic is analogous to the choice between ZFC and V as a basis for set theory: \"As with second-order logic, we cannot really choose whether we axiomatize mathematics using V or ZFC. The result is the same in both cases, as ZFC is the best attempt so far to use V as an axiomatization of mathematics.\"\n\nExpressive power\nSecond-order logic is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, if the domain is the set of all real numbers, one can assert in first-order logic the existence of an additive inverse of each real number by writing \u2200x \u2203y (x + y = 0) but one needs second-order logic to assert the least-upper-bound property for sets of real numbers, which states that every bounded, nonempty set of real numbers has a supremum. If the domain is the set of all real numbers, the following second-order sentence (split over two lines) expresses the least upper bound property:\n (\u2200 A) ([ \u2227 ] \n\u2192 )\nThis formula is a direct formalization of \"every ,  set A .\" It can be shown that any ordered field that satisfies this property is isomorphic to the real number field. On the other hand, the set of first-order sentences valid in the reals has arbitrarily large models due to the compactness theorem. Thus the least-upper-bound property cannot be expressed by any set of sentences in first-order logic.  (In fact, every real-closed field satisfies the same first-order sentences in the signature  as the real numbers.)\n\nIn second-order logic, it is possible to write formal sentences which say \"the domain is finite\" or \"the domain is of countable cardinality.\" To say that the domain is finite, use the sentence that says that every surjective function from the domain to itself is injective. To say that the domain has countable cardinality, use the sentence that says that there is a bijection between every two infinite subsets of the domain. It follows from the compactness theorem and the upward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem that it is not possible to characterize finiteness or countability, respectively, in first-order logic.\n\nCertain fragments of second order logic like ESO are also more expressive than first-order logic even though they are strictly less expressive than the full second-order logic. ESO also enjoys translation equivalence with some extensions of first-order logic which allow non-linear ordering of quantifier dependencies, like first-order logic extended with Henkin quantifiers, Hintikka and Sandu's independence-friendly logic, and V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen's dependence logic.\n\nDeductive systems\n\nA deductive system for a logic is a set of inference rules and logical axioms that determine which sequences of formulas constitute valid proofs. Several deductive systems can be used for second-order logic, although none can be complete for the standard semantics (see below). Each of these systems is sound, which means any sentence they can be used to prove is logically valid in the appropriate semantics.\n\nThe weakest deductive system that can be used consists of a standard deductive system for first-order logic (such as natural deduction) augmented with substitution rules for second-order terms.Such a system is used without comment by Hinman (2005). This deductive system is commonly used in the study of second-order arithmetic.\n\nThe deductive systems considered by Shapiro (1991) and Henkin (1950) add to the augmented first-order deductive scheme both comprehension axioms and choice axioms. These axioms are sound for standard second-order semantics. They are sound for Henkin semantics restricted to Henkin models satisfying the comprehension and choice axioms.These are the models originally studied by Henkin (1950).\n\nNon-reducibility to first-order logic\n\nOne might attempt to reduce the second-order theory of the real numbers, with full second-order semantics, to the first-order theory in the following way. First expand the domain from the set of all real numbers to a two-sorted domain, with the second sort containing all sets of real numbers. Add a new binary predicate to the language: the membership relation. Then sentences that were second-order become first-order, with the formerly second-order quantifiers ranging over the second sort instead. This reduction can be attempted in a one-sorted theory by adding unary predicates that tell whether an element is a number or a set, and taking the domain to be the union of the set of real numbers and the power set of the real numbers.\n\nBut notice that the domain was asserted to include all sets of real numbers. That requirement cannot be reduced to a first-order sentence, as the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows. That theorem implies that there is some countably infinite subset of the real numbers, whose members we will call internal numbers, and some countably infinite collection of sets of internal numbers, whose members we will call \"internal sets\", such that the domain consisting of internal numbers and internal sets satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as are satisfied by the domain of real numbers and sets of real numbers. In particular, it satisfies a sort of least-upper-bound axiom that says, in effect:\n\nEvery nonempty internal set that has an internal upper bound has a least internal upper bound.\n\nCountability of the set of all internal numbers (in conjunction with the fact that those form a densely ordered set) implies that that set does not satisfy the full least-upper-bound axiom. Countability of the set of all internal sets implies that it is not the set of all subsets of the set of all internal numbers (since Cantor's theorem implies that the set of all subsets of a countably infinite set is an uncountably infinite set). This construction is closely related to Skolem's paradox.\n\nThus the first-order theory of real numbers and sets of real numbers has many models, some of which are countable. The second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model, however.\nThis follows from the classical theorem that there is only one Archimedean complete ordered field, along with the fact that all the axioms of an Archimedean complete ordered field are expressible in second-order logic. This shows that the second-order theory of the real numbers cannot be reduced to a first-order theory, in the sense that the second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model but the corresponding first-order theory has many models.\n\nThere are more extreme examples showing that second-order logic with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. There is a finite second-order theory whose only model is the real numbers if the continuum hypothesis holds and which has no model if the continuum hypothesis does not hold (cf. Shapiro 2000, p.\u00a0105). This theory consists of a finite theory characterizing the real numbers as a complete Archimedean ordered field plus an axiom saying that the domain is of the first uncountable cardinality. This example illustrates that the question of whether a sentence in second-order logic is consistent is extremely subtle.\n\nAdditional limitations of second order logic are described in the next section.\n\nMetalogical results\nIt is a corollary of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem that there is no deductive system (that is, no notion of provability) for second-order formulas that simultaneously satisfies these three desired attributes:The proof of this corollary is that a sound, complete, and effective deduction system for standard semantics could be used to produce a recursively enumerable completion of Peano arithmetic, which G\u00f6del's theorem shows cannot exist.\n\n (Soundness) Every provable second-order sentence is universally valid, i.e., true in all domains under standard semantics.\n (Completeness) Every universally valid second-order formula, under standard semantics, is provable.\n (Effectiveness) There is a proof-checking algorithm that can correctly decide whether a given sequence of symbols is a proof or not.\n\nThis corollary is sometimes expressed by saying that second-order logic does not admit a complete proof theory. In this respect second-order logic with standard semantics differs from first-order logic; Quine (1970, pp.\u00a090\u201391) pointed to the lack of a complete proof system as a reason for thinking of second-order logic as not logic, properly speaking.\n\nAs mentioned above, Henkin proved that the standard deductive system for first-order logic is sound, complete, and effective for second-order logic with Henkin semantics, and the deductive system with comprehension and choice principles is sound, complete, and effective for Henkin semantics using only models that satisfy these principles.\n\nThe compactness theorem and the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem do not hold for full models of second-order logic. They do hold however for Henkin models. (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2001)\n\nHistory and disputed value\n\nPredicate logic was introduced to the mathematical community by C. S. Peirce, who coined the term second-order logic and whose notation is most similar to the modern form (Putnam 1982). However, today most students of logic are more familiar with the works of Frege, who published his work several years prior to Peirce but whose works remained less known until Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead made them famous.  Frege used different variables to distinguish quantification over objects from quantification over properties and sets; but he did not see himself as doing two different kinds of logic.  After the discovery of Russell's paradox it was realized that something was wrong with his system.  Eventually logicians found that restricting Frege's logic in various ways\u2014to what is now called first-order logic\u2014eliminated this problem: sets and properties cannot be quantified over in first-order-logic alone.  The now-standard hierarchy of orders of logics dates from this time.\n\nIt was found that set theory could be formulated as an axiomatized system within the apparatus of first-order logic (at the cost of several kinds of completeness, but nothing so bad as Russell's paradox), and this was done (see Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory), as sets are vital for mathematics.  Arithmetic, mereology, and a variety of other powerful logical theories could be formulated axiomatically without appeal to any more logical apparatus than first-order quantification, and this, along with G\u00f6del and Skolem's adherence to first-order logic, led to a general decline in work in second (or any higher) order logic.\n\nThis rejection was actively advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine.  Quine advanced the view that in predicate-language sentences like Fx the \"x\" is to be thought of as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in \"For all things, it is the case that . . .\" but the \"F\" is to be thought of as an abbreviation for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property).  For example, it might mean \" . . . is a dog.\"  But it makes no sense to think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by Boolos.\n\nIn recent years second-order logic has made something of a recovery, buoyed by George Boolos's interpretation of second-order quantification as plural quantification over the same domain of objects as first-order quantification (Boolos 1984).  Boolos furthermore points to the claimed nonfirstorderizability of sentences such as \"Some critics admire only each other\" and \"Some of Fianchetto's men went into the warehouse unaccompanied by anyone else\", which he argues can only be expressed by the full force of second-order quantification.  However, generalized quantification and partially ordered, or branching, quantification may suffice to express a certain class of purportedly nonfirstorderizable sentences as well and it does not appeal to second-order quantification.\n\n Relation to computational complexity\n\nThe expressive power of various forms of second-order logic on finite structures is intimately tied to computational complexity theory. The field of descriptive complexity studies which computational complexity classes can be characterized by the power of the logic needed to express languages (sets of finite strings) in  them. A string w\u00a0=\u00a0w1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7wn in a finite alphabet A can be represented by a finite structure with domain D\u00a0=\u00a0{1,...,n}, unary predicates Pa for each a\u00a0\u2208\u00a0A, satisfied by those indices i such that wi\u00a0=\u00a0a, and additional predicates which serve to uniquely identify which index is which (typically, one takes the graph of the successor function on D or the order relation <, possibly with other arithmetic predicates). Conversely, the table of any finite structure can be encoded by a finite string.\n\nWith this identification, we have the following characterizations of variants of second-order logic over finite structures:\n REG (the set of regular languages) is definable by monadic, second-order formulas (B\u00fcchi's theorem, 1960)\n NP is the set of languages definable by existential, second-order formulas (Fagin's theorem, 1974).\n co-NP is the set of languages definable by universal, second-order formulas.\n PH is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas.\n PSPACE is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added transitive closure operator.\n EXPTIME is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added least fixed point operator.\nRelationships among these classes directly impact the relative expressiveness of the logics over finite structures; for example, if PH\u00a0=\u00a0PSPACE, then adding a transitive closure operator to second-order logic would not make it any more expressive over finite structures.\n\nSee also\n\n First-order logic\n Hanf number\n Higher-order logic\n L\u00f6wenheim number\n Omega language\n Second-order propositional logic\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n.

For example, it has been used as a basis for the rapid construction of an approximate solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (which asks for the shortest sequence of a given set of points): The heuristic is simply to visit the points in the same sequence as they appear on the Sierpi\u0144ski curve.  To do this requires two steps: First compute an inverse image of each point to be visited; then sort the values. This idea has been used to build routing systems for commercial vehicles based only on Rolodex card files.\n\nA space-filling curve is a continuous map of the unit interval onto a unit square and so a (pseudo) inverse maps the unit square to the unit interval.  One way of constructing a pseudo-inverse is as follows.  Let the lower-left corner (0,\u00a00) of the unit square correspond to 0.0 (and 1.0).  Then the upper-left corner (0,\u00a01) must correspond to 0.25, the upper-right corner (1,\u00a01) to 0.50, and the lower-right corner (1,\u00a00) to 0.75.  The inverse map of interior points are computed by taking advantage of the recursive structure of the curve. Here is a function coded in Java that will compute the relative position of any point on the Sierpi\u0144ski curve (that is, a pseudo-inverse value).  It takes as input the coordinates of the point (x,y) to be inverted, and the corners of an enclosing right isosceles triangle (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy).

{"title": "Term logic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_logic", "text": "In philosophy, term logic, also known as traditional logic, syllogistic logic or Aristotelian logic, is a loose name for an approach to logic that began with Aristotle and that was dominant until the advent of modern predicate logic in the late nineteenth century. This entry is an introduction to the term logic needed to understand philosophy texts written before it was replaced as a formal logic system by predicate logic. Readers lacking a grasp of the basic terminology and ideas of term logic can have difficulty understanding such texts, because their authors typically assumed an acquaintance with term logic.\n\n Aristotle's system \n\nAristotle's logical work is collected in the six texts that are collectively known as the Organon. Two of these texts in particular, namely the Prior Analytics and De Interpretatione, contain the heart of Aristotle's treatment of judgements and formal inference, and it is principally this part of Aristotle's works that is about term logic. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Jan Lukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm.Degnan, M. 1994. Recent Work in Aristotle's Logic. Philosophical Books 35.2 (April, 1994): 81-89. The Jan Lukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley \u2013 which informs modern translations of Prior Analytics by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009.*Review of \"Aristotle, Prior Analytics: Book I, Gisela Striker (translation and commentary), Oxford UP, 2009, 268pp., $39.95 (pbk), .\" in the Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, 2010.02.02.\n\n Basics \n\nThe fundamental assumption behind the theory is that propositions are composed of two terms \u2013 hence the name \"two-term theory\" or \"term logic\" \u2013 and that the reasoning process is in turn built from propositions:\nThe term is a part of speech representing something, but which is not true or false in its own right, such as \"man\" or \"mortal\".\nThe proposition consists of two terms, in which one term (the \"predicate\") is \"affirmed\" or \"denied\" of the other (the \"subject\"), and which is capable of truth or falsity.\nThe syllogism is an inference in which one proposition (the \"conclusion\") follows of necessity from two other propositions (the \"premises\").\n\nA proposition may be universal or particular, and it may be affirmative or negative. Traditionally, the four kinds of propositions are:\n A-type: Universal and affirmative (\"All philosophers are mortal\")\n I-type: Particular and affirmative (\"Some philosophers are mortal\")\n E-type: Universal and negative (\"All philosophers are not mortal\")\n O-type: Particular and negative (\"Some philosophers are not mortal\")\nThis was called the fourfold scheme of propositions (see types of syllogism for an explanation of the letters A, I, E, and O in the traditional square). Aristotle's original square of opposition, however, does not lack existential import.\n\nIn the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article, \"The Traditional Square of Opposition\", Terence Parsons explains:\n\n Term \n\nA term (Greek horos) is the basic component of the proposition.  The original meaning of the horos (and also of the Latin terminus) is \"extreme\" or \"boundary\". The two terms lie on the outside of the proposition, joined by the act of affirmation or denial.\nFor early modern logicians like Arnauld (whose Port-Royal Logic was the best-known text of his day), it is a psychological entity like an \"idea\" or \"concept\".  Mill considers it a word.  To assert \"all Greeks are men\" is not to say that the concept of Greeks is the concept of men, or that word \"Greeks\" is the word \"men\".  A proposition cannot be built from real things or ideas, but it is not just meaningless words either.\n\n Proposition \n\nIn term logic, a \"proposition\" is simply a form of language: a particular kind of sentence, in which the subject and predicate are combined, so as to assert something true or false.  It is not a thought, or an abstract entity.  The word \"propositio\" is from the Latin, meaning the first premise of a syllogism.  Aristotle uses the word premise (protasis) as a sentence affirming or denying one thing or another (Posterior Analytics 1. 1 24a 16), so a premise is also a form of words.\nHowever, as in modern philosophical logic, it means that which is asserted by the sentence.  Writers before Frege and Russell, such as Bradley, sometimes spoke of the \"judgment\" as something distinct from a sentence, but this is not quite the same.  As a further confusion the word \"sentence\" derives from the Latin, meaning an opinion or judgment, and so is equivalent to \"proposition\".\n\nThe logical quality of a proposition is whether it is affirmative (the predicate is affirmed of the subject) or negative (the predicate is denied of the subject).  Thus every philosopher is mortal is affirmative, since the mortality of philosophers is affirmed universally, whereas no philosopher is mortal is negative by denying such mortality in particular.\n\nThe quantity of a proposition is whether it is universal (the predicate is affirmed or denied of all subjects or of \"the whole\") or particular (the predicate is affirmed or denied of some subject or a \"part\" thereof). In case where existential import is assumed, quantification implies the existence of at least one subject, unless disclaimed.\n\n Singular terms \n\nFor Aristotle, the distinction between singular and universal is a fundamental metaphysical one, and not merely grammatical.  A singular term for Aristotle is primary substance, which can only be predicated of itself: (this) \"Callias\" or (this) \"Socrates\" are not predicable of any other thing, thus one does not say every Socrates one says every human (De Int. 7; Meta. D9, 1018a4).  It may feature as a grammatical predicate, as in the sentence \"the person coming this way is Callias\".  But it is still a logical subject.\n\nHe contrasts universal (katholou). secondary substance, genera, with primary substance, particular (kath' hekaston). specimens. The formal nature of universals, in so far as they can be generalized \"always, or for the most part\", is the subject matter of both scientific study and formal logic.They are mentioned briefly in the De Interpretatione.  Afterwards, in the chapters of the Prior Analytics where Aristotle methodically sets out his theory of the syllogism, they are entirely ignored.\n\nThe essential feature of the syllogism is that, of the four terms in the two premises, one must occur twice.  Thus\n\nAll Greeks are men\nAll men are mortal.\n\nThe subject of one premise, must be the predicate of the other, and so it is necessary to eliminate from the logic any terms which cannot function both as subject and predicate, namely singular terms.\n\nHowever, in a popular 17th century version of the syllogism, Port-Royal Logic, singular terms were treated as universals:Arnauld, Antoine and Nicole, Pierre; (1662) La logique, ou l'art de penser. Part 2, chapter 3\n\nAll men are mortals\nAll Socrates are men\nAll Socrates are mortals\n\nThis is clearly awkward, a weakness exploited by Frege in his devastating attack on the system.\n\nThe famous syllogism \"Socrates is a man ...\", is frequently quoted as though from Aristotle,For example: Kapp, Greek Foundations of Traditional Logic, New York 1942, p.\u00a017, Copleston A History of Philosophy Vol. I., p.\u00a0277, Russell, A History of Western Philosophy London 1946 p.\u00a0218. but in fact, it is nowhere in the Organon.  Sextus Empiricus in his Hyp. Pyrrh (Outlines of Pyrronism) ii. 164 first mentions the related syllogism \"Socrates is a human being, Every human being is an animal, Therefore, Socrates is an animal.\"\n\n Influence on philosophy \nThe Aristotelian logical system had a formidable influence on the late-philosophy of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. In the early 1970s, Lacan reworked Aristotle's term logic by way of Frege and Jacques Brunschwig to produce his four formulae of sexuation. While these formulae retain the formal arrangement of the square of opposition, they seek to undermine the universals of both qualities by the 'existence without essence' of Lacan's particular negative proposition.\n\n Decline of term logic \n\nTerm logic began to decline in Europe during the Renaissance, when logicians like Rodolphus Agricola Phrisius (1444\u20131485) and Ramus (1515\u20131572) began to promote place logics. The logical tradition called Port-Royal Logic, or sometimes \"traditional logic\", saw propositions as combinations of ideas rather than of terms, but otherwise followed many of the conventions of term logic. It remained influential, especially in England, until the 19th century. Leibniz created a distinctive logical calculus, but nearly all of his work on logic remained unpublished and unremarked until Louis Couturat went through the Leibniz Nachlass around 1900, publishing his pioneering studies in logic.\n\n19th-century attempts to algebraize logic, such as the work of Boole (1815\u20131864) and Venn (1834\u20131923), typically yielded systems highly influenced by the term-logic tradition. The first predicate logic was that of Frege's landmark Begriffsschrift (1879), little read before 1950, in part because of its eccentric notation. Modern predicate logic as we know it began in the 1880s with the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, who influenced Peano (1858\u20131932) and even more, Ernst Schr\u00f6der (1841\u20131902). It reached fruition in the hands of Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead, whose Principia Mathematica (1910\u201313) made use of a variant of Peano's predicate logic.\n\nTerm logic also survived to some extent in traditional Roman Catholic education, especially in seminaries. Medieval Catholic theology, especially the writings of Thomas Aquinas, had a powerfully Aristotelean cast, and thus term logic became a part of Catholic theological reasoning. For example, Joyce's Principles of Logic (1908; 3rd edition 1949), written for use in Catholic seminaries, made no mention of Frege or of Bertrand Russell.Copleston's A History of Philosophy\n\n Revival \n\nSome philosophers have complained that predicate logic:\n Is unnatural in a sense, in that its syntax does not follow the syntax of the sentences that figure in our everyday reasoning. It is, as Quine acknowledged, \"Procrustean,\" employing an artificial language of function and argument, quantifier, and bound variable.\n Suffers from theoretical problems, probably the most serious being empty names and identity statements.\n\nEven academic philosophers entirely in the mainstream, such as Gareth Evans, have written as follows:\n\"I come to semantic investigations with a preference for homophonic theories; theories which try to take serious account of the syntactic and semantic devices which actually exist in the language ...I would prefer [such] a theory ... over a theory which is only able to deal with [sentences of the form \"all A's are B's\"] by \"discovering\" hidden logical constants ... The objection would not be that such [Fregean] truth conditions are not correct, but that, in a sense which we would all dearly love to have more exactly explained, the syntactic shape of the sentence is treated as so much misleading surface structure\"  (Evans 1977)\n\n See also \n\nConverse (logic)\nObversion\nPort-Royal Logic\n\nPropositional calculus\nStoic logic\nTransposition (logic)\n\n Notes \n\n References \n Bochenski, I.

{"title": "Thoralf Skolem", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoralf_Skolem", "text": "Thoralf Albert Skolem (23 May 1887 \u2013 23 March 1963) () was a Norwegian mathematician who worked in mathematical logic and set theory.\n\n Life \nAlthough Skolem's father was a primary school teacher, most of his extended family were farmers. Skolem attended secondary school in Kristiania (later renamed Oslo), passing the university entrance examinations in 1905. He then entered Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet to study mathematics, also taking courses in physics, chemistry, zoology and botany.\n\nIn 1909, he began working as an assistant to the physicist Kristian Birkeland, known for bombarding magnetized spheres with electrons and obtaining aurora-like effects; thus Skolem's first publications were physics papers written jointly with Birkeland. In 1913, Skolem passed the state examinations with distinction, and completed a dissertation titled Investigations on the Algebra of Logic. He also traveled with Birkeland to the Sudan to observe the zodiacal light. He spent the winter semester of 1915 at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, at the time the leading research center in mathematical logic, metamathematics, and abstract algebra, fields in which Skolem eventually excelled. In 1916 he was appointed a research fellow at Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet. In 1918, he became a Docent in Mathematics and was elected to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.\n\nSkolem did not at first formally enroll as a Ph.D. candidate, believing that the Ph.D. was unnecessary in Norway. He later changed his mind and submitted a thesis in 1926, titled Some theorems about integral solutions to certain algebraic equations and inequalities. His notional thesis advisor was Axel Thue, even though Thue had died in 1922.\n\nIn 1927, he married Edith Wilhelmine Hasvold.\n\nSkolem continued to teach at Det kongelige Frederiks Universitet (renamed the University of Oslo in 1939) until 1930 when he became a Research Associate in Chr. Michelsen Institute in Bergen. This senior post allowed Skolem to conduct research free of administrative and teaching duties. However, the position also required that he reside in Bergen, a city which then lacked a university and hence had no research library, so that he was unable to keep abreast of the mathematical literature. In 1938, he returned to Oslo to assume the Professorship of Mathematics at the university. There he taught the graduate courses in algebra and number theory, and only occasionally on mathematical logic. Skolem's Ph.D. student \u00d8ystein Ore went on to a career in the USA.\n\nSkolem served as president of the Norwegian Mathematical Society, and edited the Norsk Matematisk Tidsskrift (\"The Norwegian Mathematical Journal\") for many years. He was also the founding editor of Mathematica Scandinavica.\n\nAfter his 1957 retirement, he made several trips to the United States, speaking and teaching at universities there. He remained intellectually active until his sudden and unexpected death.\n\nFor more on Skolem's academic life, see Fenstad (1970).\n\n Mathematics \nSkolem published around 180 papers on Diophantine equations, group theory, lattice theory, and most of all, set theory and mathematical logic. He mostly published in Norwegian journals with limited international circulation, so that his results were occasionally rediscovered by others. An example is the Skolem\u2013Noether theorem, characterizing the automorphisms of simple algebras. Skolem published a proof in 1927, but Emmy Noether independently rediscovered it a few years later.\n\nSkolem was among the first to write on lattices. In 1912, he was the first to describe a free distributive lattice generated by n elements. In 1919, he showed that every implicative lattice (now also called a Skolem lattice) is distributive and, as a partial converse, that every finite distributive lattice is implicative. After these results were rediscovered by others, Skolem published a 1936 paper in German, \"\u00dcber gewisse 'Verb\u00e4nde' oder 'Lattices'\", surveying his earlier work in lattice theory.\n\nSkolem was a pioneer model theorist. In 1920, he greatly simplified the proof of a theorem Leopold L\u00f6wenheim first proved in 1915, resulting in the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, which states that if a countable first-order theory has an infinite model, then it has a countable model. His 1920 proof employed the axiom of choice, but he later (1922 and 1928) gave proofs using K\u0151nig's lemma in place of that axiom. It is notable that Skolem, like L\u00f6wenheim, wrote on mathematical logic and set theory employing the notation of his fellow pioneering model theorists Charles Sanders Peirce and Ernst Schr\u00f6der, including \u220f, \u2211 as variable-binding quantifiers, in contrast to the notations of Peano, Principia Mathematica, and Principles of Mathematical Logic. Skolem (1934) pioneered the construction of non-standard models of arithmetic and set theory.\n\nSkolem (1922) refined Zermelo's axioms for set theory by replacing Zermelo's vague notion of a \"definite\" property with any property that can be coded in first-order logic. The resulting axiom is now part of the standard axioms of set theory. Skolem also pointed out that a consequence of the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem is what is now known as Skolem's paradox: If Zermelo's axioms are consistent, then they must be satisfiable within a countable domain, even though they prove the existence of uncountable sets.\n\n Completeness \nThe completeness of first-order logic is an easy corollary of results Skolem proved in the early 1920s and discussed in Skolem (1928), but he failed to note this fact, perhaps because mathematicians and logicians did not become fully aware of completeness as a fundamental metamathematical problem until the 1928 first edition of Hilbert and Ackermann's Principles of Mathematical Logic clearly articulated it. In any event, Kurt G\u00f6del first proved this completeness in 1930.\n\nSkolem distrusted the completed infinite and was one of the founders of finitism in mathematics. Skolem (1923) sets out his primitive recursive arithmetic, a very early contribution to the theory of computable functions, as a means of avoiding the so-called paradoxes of the infinite. Here he developed the arithmetic of the natural numbers by first defining objects by primitive recursion, then devising another system to prove properties of the objects defined by the first system. These two systems enabled him to define prime numbers and to set out a considerable amount of number theory. If the first of these systems can be considered as a programming language for defining objects, and the second as a programming logic for proving properties about the objects, Skolem can be seen as an unwitting pioneer of theoretical computer science.\n\nIn 1929, Presburger proved that Peano arithmetic without multiplication was consistent, complete, and decidable. The following year, Skolem proved that the same was true of Peano arithmetic without addition, a system named Skolem arithmetic in his honor. G\u00f6del's famous 1931 result is that Peano arithmetic itself (with both addition and multiplication) is incompletable and hence a posteriori undecidable.\n\nHao Wang praised Skolem's work as follows:\n\"Skolem tends to treat general problems by concrete examples. He often seemed to present proofs in the same order as he came to discover them. This results in a fresh informality as well as a certain inconclusiveness. Many of his papers strike one as progress reports. Yet his ideas are often pregnant and potentially capable of wide application. He was very much a 'free spirit': he did not belong to any school, he did not found a school of his own, he did not usually make heavy use of known results... he was very much an innovator and most of his papers can be read and understood by those without much specialized knowledge. It seems quite likely that if he were young today, logic... would not have appealed to him.\" (Skolem 1970: 17-18)\n\nFor more on Skolem's accomplishments, see Hao Wang (1970).\n\nSee also\n\nLeopold L\u00f6wenheim\nModel theory\nSkolem normal form\nSkolem's paradox\nSkolem problem\nSkolem sequence\nSkolem\u2013Mahler\u2013Lech theorem\n\nReferences\n\nPrimary\n  \nSkolem, T.

Thus there is one set V\u03b1 for each ordinal number \u03b1. V\u03b1 may be defined by transfinite recursion as follows:\n Let V0 be the empty set:\n\n For any ordinal number \u03b2, let V\u03b2+1 be the power set of V\u03b2:\n \n For any limit ordinal \u03bb, let V\u03bb be the union of all the V-stages so far:\n \nA crucial fact about this definition is that there is a single formula \u03c6(\u03b1,x) in the language of ZFC that defines \"the set x is in V\u03b1\".\n\nThe sets  V\u03b1 are called stages or ranks.\n\nThe class V is defined to be the union of all the V-stages:\n \n\nAn equivalent definition sets\n\nfor each ordinal \u03b1, where  is the powerset of .\n\nThe rank of a set S is the smallest \u03b1 such that  Another way to calculate rank is:\n.\n\nFinite and low cardinality stages of the hierarchy\n\nThe first five von Neumann stages V0 to V4 may be visualized as follows. (An empty box represents the empty set. A box containing only an empty box represents the set containing only the empty set, and so forth.)\n\n750px|frameless|center|First 5 von Neumann stages\n\nThe set V5 contains 216 = 65536 elements. The set V6 contains 265536 elements, which very substantially exceeds the number of atoms in the known universe. So the finite stages of the cumulative hierarchy cannot be written down explicitly after stage 5. The set V\u03c9 has the same cardinality as \u03c9. The set V\u03c9+1 has the same cardinality as the set of real numbers.\n\nApplications and interpretations\n\nApplications of V as models for set theories\nIf \u03c9 is the set of natural numbers, then V\u03c9 is the set of hereditarily finite sets, which is a model of set theory without the axiom of infinity., proves that: \"V\u03c9 is a model of all of the axioms of ZFC except infinity.\", states: \"The first really interesting axiom [of ZF set theory] is the Axiom of Infinity. If we drop it, then we can take as a model for ZF the set M of all finite sets which can be built up from \u2205. [...] It is clear that M will be a model for the other axioms, since none of these lead out of the class of finite sets.\"\n\nV\u03c9+\u03c9 is the universe of \"ordinary mathematics\", and is a model of Zermelo set theory..\nSee page 96 for proof that V\u03c9+\u03c9 is a Zermelo model.  A simple argument in favour of the adequacy of V\u03c9+\u03c9 is the observation that V\u03c9+1 is adequate for the integers, while V\u03c9+2 is adequate for the real numbers, and most other normal mathematics can be built as relations of various kinds from these sets without needing the axiom of replacement to go outside V\u03c9+\u03c9.\n\nIf \u03ba is an inaccessible cardinal, then V\u03ba is a model of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) itself, and V\u03ba+1 is a model of Morse\u2013Kelley set theory., states and justifies that if \u03ba is strongly inaccessible, then V\u03ba is a model of ZF.\n \"It is clear that if A is an inaccessible cardinal, then the set of all sets of rank less than A is a model for ZF, since the only two troublesome axioms, Power Set and Replacement, do not lead out of the set of cardinals less than A.\", proves that if \u03ba is strongly inaccessible, then V\u03ba is a model of ZFC. (Note that every ZFC model is also a ZF model, and every ZF model is also a Z model.)\n\nInterpretation of V as the \"set of all sets\"\nV is not \"the set of all sets\" for two reasons. First, it is not a set; although each individual stage V\u03b1 is a set, their union V is a proper class. Second, the sets in V are only the well-founded sets. The axiom of foundation (or regularity) demands that every set be well founded and hence in V, and thus in ZFC every set is in V. But other axiom systems may omit the axiom of foundation or replace it by a strong negation (an example is Aczel's anti-foundation axiom). These non-well-founded set theories are not commonly employed, but are still possible to study.\n\nA third objection to the \"set of all sets\" interpretation is that not all sets are necessarily \"pure sets\", which are constructed from the empty set using power sets and unions. Zermelo proposed in 1908 the inclusion of urelements, from which he constructed a transfinite recursive hierarchy in 1930. Such urelements are used extensively in model theory, particularly in Fraenkel-Mostowski models..\n\nV and the axiom of regularity\nThe formula V = \u22c3\u03b1V\u03b1 is often considered to be a theorem, not a definition. Roitman states (without references) that the realization that the axiom of regularity is equivalent to the equality of the universe of ZF sets to the cumulative hierarchy is due to von Neumann.. See page 79.\n\nThe existential status of V\n\nSince the class V may be considered to be the arena for most of mathematics, it is important to establish that it \"exists\" in some sense. Since existence is a difficult concept, one typically replaces the existence question with the consistency question, that is, whether the concept is free of contradictions. A major obstacle is posed by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, which effectively imply the impossibility of proving the consistency of ZF set theory in ZF set theory itself, provided that it is in fact consistent.See article On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems and .\n\nThe integrity of the von Neumann universe depends fundamentally on the integrity of the ordinal numbers, which act as the rank parameter in the construction, and the integrity of transfinite induction, by which both the ordinal numbers and the von Neumann universe are constructed. The integrity of the ordinal number construction may be said to rest upon von Neumann's 1923 and 1928 papers., . See also the English-language presentation of von Neumann's \"general recursion theorem\" by . The integrity of the construction of V by transfinite induction may be said to have then been established in Zermelo's 1930 paper.\n\nHistory\n\nThe cumulative type hierarchy, also known as the von Neumann universe, is claimed by Gregory H. Moore (1982) to be inaccurately attributed to von Neumann.. See page 279 for the assertion of the false attribution to von Neumann. See pages 270 and 281 for the attribution to Zermelo. The first publication of the von Neumann universe was by Ernst Zermelo in 1930.. See particularly pages 36\u201340.\n\nExistence and uniqueness of the general transfinite recursive definition of sets was demonstrated in 1928 by von Neumann for both Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. and Neumann's own set theory (which later developed into NBG set theory).. See pages 745\u2013752. In neither of these papers did he apply his transfinite recursive method to construct the universe of all sets. The presentations of the von Neumann universe by Bernays. See pages 203\u2013209. and Mendelson. See page 202. both give credit to von Neumann for the transfinite induction construction method, although not for its application to the construction of the universe of ordinary sets.\n\nThe notation V is not a tribute to the name of von Neumann. It was used for the universe of sets in 1889 by Peano, the letter V signifying \"Verum\", which he used both as a logical symbol and to denote the class of all individuals.. See pages VIII and XI. Peano's notation V was adopted also by Whitehead and Russell for the class of all sets in 1910.. See page 229. The V notation (for the class of all sets) was not used by von Neumann in his 1920s papers about ordinal numbers and transfinite induction. Paul Cohen. See page 88. explicitly attributes his use of the letter V (for the class of all sets) to a 1940 paper by G\u00f6del,. although G\u00f6del most likely obtained the notation from earlier sources such as Whitehead and Russell.\n\nPhilosophical perspectives\n\nThere are two approaches to understanding the relationship of the von Neumann universe V to ZFC (along with many variations of each approach, and shadings between them). Roughly, formalists will tend to view V as something that flows from the ZFC axioms (for example, ZFC proves that every set is in V). On the other hand, realists are more likely to see the von Neumann hierarchy as something directly accessible to the intuition, and the axioms of ZFC as propositions for whose truth in V we can give direct intuitive arguments in natural language. A possible middle position is that the mental picture of the von Neumann hierarchy provides the ZFC axioms with a motivation (so that they are not arbitrary), but does not necessarily describe objects with real existence.\n\nSee also\n\nUniverse (mathematics)\nConstructible universe\nGrothendieck universe\nInaccessible cardinal\nS (set theory)\nJohn von Neumann\n\nNotes\n\n References \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .

{"title": "Well-ordering principle", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_principle", "text": "In mathematics, the well-ordering principle states that every non-empty set of positive integers contains a least element. In other words, the set of positive integers is well-ordered by its \"natural\" or \"magnitude\" order in which x precedes y if and only if y is either x or the sum of x and some positive integer (other orderings include the ordering 2, 4, 6, ..., 1, 3, 5, ...).\n\nThe phrase \"well-ordering principle\" is sometimes taken to be synonymous with the \"well-ordering theorem\". On other occasions it is understood to be the proposition that the set of integers {\u2026, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026} contains a well-ordered subset, called the natural numbers, in which every nonempty subset contains a least element.\n\nDepending on the framework in which the natural numbers are introduced, this (second order) property of the set of natural numbers is either an axiom or a provable theorem. For example:\n In Peano arithmetic, second-order arithmetic and related systems, and indeed in most (not necessarily formal) mathematical treatments of the well-ordering principle, the principle is derived from the principle of mathematical induction, which is itself taken as basic. \n Considering the natural numbers as a subset of the real numbers, and assuming that we know already that the real numbers are complete (again, either as an axiom or a theorem about the real number system), i.e., every bounded (from below) set has an infimum, then also every set A of natural numbers has an infimum, say a*. We can now find an integer n* such that a* lies in the half-open interval (n*\u22121,\u00a0n*], and can then show that we must have a*\u00a0=\u00a0n*, and n* in A. \n In axiomatic set theory, the natural numbers are defined as the smallest inductive set (i.e., set containing 0 and closed under the successor operation). One can (even without invoking the regularity axiom) show that the set of all natural numbers n such that \"{0,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0n} is well-ordered\" is inductive, and must therefore contain all natural numbers; from this property one can conclude that the set of all natural numbers is also well-ordered. \n\nIn the second sense, this phrase is used when that proposition is relied on for the purpose of justifying proofs that take the following form: to prove that every natural number belongs to a specified set S, assume the contrary, which implies that the set of counterexamples is non-empty and thus contains a smallest counterexample.  Then show that for any counterexample there is a still smaller counterexample, producing a contradiction.  This mode of argument is the contrapositive of proof by complete induction. It is known light-heartedly as the \"minimal criminal\" method and is similar in its nature to Fermat's method of \"infinite descent\".\n\nGarrett Birkhoff and Saunders Mac Lane wrote in A Survey of Modern Algebra that this property, like the least upper bound axiom for real numbers, is non-algebraic; i.e., it cannot be deduced from the algebraic properties of the integers (which form an ordered integral domain).\n\nReferences\n \n\nCategory:Wellfoundedness\nCategory:Mathematical principles\n\ncs:Princip dobr\u00e9ho uspo\u0159\u00e1d\u00e1n\u00ed"}

His major writings include \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" (1951), which attacked the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions and advocated a form of semantic holism, and Word and Object (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine's famous indeterminacy of translation thesis, advocating a behaviorist theory of meaning.

Zalta (ed.)\n\nBiography\nAccording to his autobiography, The Time of My Life (1986), Quine grew up in Akron, Ohio, where he lived with his parents and older brother Robert Cloyd. His father, Cloyd Robert,The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1 was a manufacturing entrepreneur (founder of the Akron Equipment Company, which produced tire molds)The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1 and his mother, Harriett E., was a schoolteacher and later a housewife. He received his B.A. in mathematics from Oberlin College in 1930, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University in 1932. His thesis supervisor was Alfred North Whitehead. He was then appointed a Harvard Junior Fellow, which excused him from having to teach for four years. During the academic year 1932\u201333, he travelled in Europe thanks to a Sheldon fellowship, meeting Polish logicians (including Stanislaw Lesniewski and Alfred Tarski) and members of the Vienna Circle (including Rudolf Carnap), as well as the logical positivist A. J. Ayer.\n\nIt was Quine who arranged for Tarski to be invited to the September 1939 Unity of Science Congress in Cambridge, for which Tarski sailed on the last ship to leave Danzig before the Third Reich invaded Poland. Tarski survived the war and worked another 44 years in the US.\n\nDuring World War II, Quine lectured on logic in Brazil, in Portuguese, and served in the United States Navy in a military intelligence role, deciphering messages from German submarines, and reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.\n\nAt Harvard, Quine helped supervise the Harvard graduate theses of, among others, David Lewis, Daniel Dennett, Gilbert Harman, Dagfinn F\u00f8llesdal, Hao Wang, Hugues LeBlanc,  Henry Hiz and George Myro. For the academic year 1964\u20131965, Quine was a fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.\"Guide to the Center for Advanced Studies Records, 1958\u20131969\" . Weselyan University. Wesleyan.edu. Accessed March 8, 2010. In 1980\nQuine received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Humanities at Uppsala University, Sweden.http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/\n\nQuine was an atheist when he was a teenager.\n\nHe had four children by two marriages. Guitarist Robert Quine was his nephew.\n\nIn the foreword to the new edition of Word and Object, Quine's student Dagfinn F\u00f8llesdal noted that Quine began to lose his memory toward the end of his life. The deterioration of his short-term memory was so severe that he struggled to continue following arguments. Quine also had considerable difficulty in his project to make the desired revisions to Word and Object. Before passing away, Quine noted to Morton White, \"I do not remember what my illness is called, Althusser or Alzheimer, but since I cannot remember it, it must be Alzheimer.\" He died from the illness on Christmas Day in 2000. W.V. Quine. Word and Object 2013. MIT Press.\n\nPolitical beliefs\nQuine was politically conservative, but the bulk of his writing was in technical areas of philosophy removed from direct political issues.The Wall Street Journal, obituary for W V Quine \u2013 January 4, 2001 He did, however, write in defense of several conservative positions: for example, in Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary, he wrote a defense of moral censorship;Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary, entry for Tolerance (pp. 206\u20138) while, in his autobiography, he made some criticisms of American postwar academic culture.\"Paradoxes of Plenty\" in Theories and Things, p. 197The Time of My Life: An Autobiography, pp. 352\u20133.\n\nWork\nQuine's Ph.D. thesis and early publications were on formal logic and set theory. Only after World War II did he, by virtue of seminal papers on ontology, epistemology and language, emerge as a major philosopher. By the 1960s, he had worked out his \"naturalized epistemology\" whose aim was to answer all substantive questions of knowledge and meaning using the methods and tools of the natural sciences. Quine roundly rejected the notion that there should be a \"first philosophy\", a theoretical standpoint somehow prior to natural science and capable of justifying it. These views are intrinsic to his naturalism.\n\nQuine could lecture in French, Spanish, Portuguese and German, as well as his native English. Like the logical positivists, Quine evinced little interest in the philosophical canon: only once did he teach a course in the history of philosophy, on David Hume.\n\nRejection of the analytic\u2013synthetic distinction\n\nIn the 1930s and 40s, discussions with Rudolf Carnap, Nelson Goodman and Alfred Tarski, among others, led Quine to doubt the tenability of the distinction between \"analytic\" statements\u2014those true simply by the meanings of their words, such as \"All bachelors are unmarried\"\u2014and \"synthetic\" statements, those true or false by virtue of facts about the world, such as \"There is a cat on the mat.\" This distinction was central to logical positivism. Although Quine is not normally associated with verificationism, some philosophers believe the tenet is not incompatible with his general philosophy of language, citing his Harvard colleague B. F. Skinner and his analysis of language in Verbal Behavior.Prawitz, Dag. 'Quine and Verificationism.' In Inquiry, Stockholm, 1994, pp 487\u2013494\n\nLike other Analytic philosophers before him, Quine accepted the definition of \"analytic\" as \"true in virtue of meaning alone\". Unlike them, however, he concluded that ultimately the definition was circular. In other words, Quine accepted that analytic statements are those that are true by definition, then argued that the notion of truth by definition was unsatisfactory. \n\nQuine's chief objection to analyticity is with the notion of synonymy (sameness of meaning), a sentence being analytic, just in case it substitutes a synonym for one \"black\" in a proposition like \"All black things are black\" (or any other logical truth). The objection to synonymy hinges upon the problem of collateral information. We intuitively feel that there is a distinction between \"All unmarried men are bachelors\" and \"There have been black dogs\", but a competent English speaker will assent to both sentences under all conditions since such speakers also have access to collateral information bearing on the historical existence of black dogs. Quine maintains that there is no distinction between universally known collateral information and conceptual or analytic truths.\n\nAnother approach to Quine's objection to analyticity and synonymy emerges from the modal notion of logical possibility. A traditional Wittgensteinian view of meaning held that each meaningful sentence was associated with a region in the space of possible worlds. Quine finds the notion of such a space problematic, arguing that there is no distinction between those truths which are universally and confidently believed and those which are necessarily true.\n\nConfirmation holism and ontological relativity\nThe central theses underlying the indeterminacy of translation and other extensions of Quine's work are ontological relativity and the related doctrine of confirmation holism. The premise of confirmation holism is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by empirical data (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks' assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.\n\nQuine concluded his \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" as follows:\nAs an empiricist I continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of past experience. Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer . . . For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.\n\nQuine's ontological relativism (evident in the passage above) led him to agree with Pierre Duhem that for any collection of empirical evidence, there would always be many theories able to account for it. However, Duhem's holism is much more restricted and limited than Quine's. For Duhem, underdetermination applies only to physics or possibly to natural science, while for Quine it applies to all of human knowledge. Thus, while it is possible to verify or falsify whole theories, it is not possible to verify or falsify individual statements. Almost any particular statement can be saved, given sufficiently radical modifications of the containing theory. For Quine, scientific thought forms a coherent web in which any part could be altered in the light of empirical evidence, and in which no empirical evidence could force the revision of a given part.\n\nExistence and its contrary\nThe problem of non-referring names is an old puzzle in philosophy, which Quine captured when he wrote,\n\nA curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity.  It can be put into three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: 'What is there?'  It can be answered, moreover, in a word\u2014'Everything'\u2014and everyone will accept this answer as true.W. V. O. Quine, \"On What There Is\", The Review of Metaphysics 2(5), 1948.\n\nMore directly, the controversy goes,\n\nHow can we talk about Pegasus?  To what does the word 'Pegasus' refer?  If our answer is, 'Something,' then we seem to believe in mystical entities; if our answer is, 'nothing', then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this?  Certainly when we said that Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and moreover we speak the truth!  If we speak the truth, this must be truth about something.  So we cannot be speaking of nothing.\n\nQuine resists the temptation to say that non-referring terms are meaningless for reasons made clear above.  Instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know the proper way to understand them.  However, Czes\u0142aw Lejewski criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it seems we should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain.  Lejewski writes further,\n\nThis state of affairs does not seem to be very satisfactory.  The idea that some of our rules of inference should depend on empirical information, which may not be forthcoming, is so foreign to the character of logical inquiry that a thorough re-examination of the two inferences [existential generalization and universal instantiation] may prove worth our while.\n\nLejewski then goes on to offer a description of free logic, which he claims accommodates an answer to the problem.\n\nLejewski also points out that free logic additionally can handle the problem of the empty set for statements like .  Quine had considered the problem of the empty set unrealistic, which left Lejewski unsatisfied.Czeslaw Lejewski, \"Logic and Existence\". British Journal for the Philosophy of Science Vol. 5 (1954\u201355), pp. 104\u2013119.\n\nLogic\nOver the course of his career, Quine published numerous technical and expository papers on formal logic, some of which are reprinted in his Selected Logic Papers and in The Ways of Paradox.\n\nQuine confined logic to classical bivalent first-order logic, hence to truth and falsity under any (nonempty) universe of discourse. Hence the following were not logic for Quine:\n Higher-order logic and set theory. He referred to higher-order logic as \"set theory in disguise\";\n Much of what Principia Mathematica included in logic was not logic for Quine.\n Formal systems involving intensional notions, especially modality. Quine was especially hostile to modal logic with quantification, a battle he largely lost when Saul Kripke's relational semantics became canonical for modal logics.\n\nQuine wrote three undergraduate texts on formal logic:\n Elementary Logic. While teaching an introductory course in 1940, Quine discovered that extant texts for philosophy students did not do justice to quantification theory or first-order predicate logic. Quine wrote this book in 6 weeks as an ad hoc solution to his teaching needs.\n Methods of Logic. The four editions of this book resulted from a more advanced undergraduate course in logic Quine taught from the end of World War II until his 1978 retirement.\n Philosophy of Logic. A concise and witty undergraduate treatment of a number of Quinian themes, such as the prevalence of use-mention confusions, the dubiousness of quantified modal logic, and the non-logical character of higher-order logic.\n\nMathematical Logic is based on Quine's graduate teaching during the 1930s and '40s. It shows that much of what Principia Mathematica took more than 1000 pages to say can be said in 250 pages. The proofs are concise, even cryptic. The last chapter, on G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem and Tarski's indefinability theorem, along with the article Quine (1946), became a launching point for Raymond Smullyan's later lucid exposition of these and related results.\n\nQuine's work in logic gradually became dated in some respects. Techniques he did not teach and discuss include analytic tableaux, recursive functions, and model theory. His treatment of metalogic left something to be desired. For example, Mathematical Logic does not include any proofs of soundness and completeness. Early in his career, the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic. His later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of Principia Mathematica. Set against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method (as exposited in his Methods of Logic) for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas, the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights, and the fine prose in which he expressed them.\n\nMost of Quine's original work in formal logic from 1960 onwards was on variants of his predicate functor logic, one of several ways that have been proposed for doing logic without quantifiers. For a comprehensive treatment of predicate functor logic and its history, see Quine (1976). For an introduction, see chpt. 45 of his Methods of Logic.\n\nQuine was very warm to the possibility that formal logic would eventually be applied outside of philosophy and mathematics. He wrote several papers on the sort of Boolean algebra employed in electrical engineering, and with Edward J. McCluskey, devised the Quine\u2013McCluskey algorithm of reducing Boolean equations to a minimum covering sum of prime implicants.\n\nSet theory\nWhile his contributions to logic include elegant expositions and a number of technical results, it is in set theory that Quine was most innovative. He always maintained that mathematics required set theory and that set theory was quite distinct from logic. He flirted with Nelson Goodman's nominalism for a while, but backed away when he failed to find a nominalist grounding of mathematics.\n\nOver the course of his career, Quine proposed three variants of axiomatic set theory, each including the axiom of extensionality:\n New Foundations, NF, creates and manipulates sets using a single axiom schema for set admissibility, namely an axiom schema of stratified comprehension, whereby all individuals satisfying a stratified formula compose a set. A stratified formula is one that type theory would allow, were the ontology to include types. However, Quine's set theory does not feature types. The metamathematics of NF are curious. NF allows many \"large\" sets the now-canonical ZFC set theory does not allow, even sets for which the axiom of choice does not hold. Since the axiom of choice holds for all finite sets, the failure of this axiom in NF proves that NF includes infinite sets. The consistency of NF relative to other formal systems adequate for mathematics is an open question, albeit that a number of candidate proofs are current in the NF community suggesting that NF is equiconsistent with Zermelo set theory without Choice.

Jensen and admitting urelements (entities that can be members of sets but that lack elements), turns out to be consistent relative to Peano arithmetic, thus vindicating the intuition behind NF. NF and NFU are the only Quinean set theories with a following. For a derivation of foundational mathematics in NF, see Rosser (1952);\n The set theory of Mathematical Logic is NF augmented by the proper classes of von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory, except axiomatized in a much simpler way;\n The set theory of Set Theory and Its Logic does away with stratification and is almost entirely derived from a single axiom schema. Quine derived the foundations of mathematics once again. This book includes the definitive exposition of Quine's theory of virtual sets and relations, and surveyed axiomatic set theory as it stood circa 1960. \n\nAll three set theories admit a universal class, but since they are free of any hierarchy of types, they have no need for a distinct universal class at each type level.\n\nQuine's set theory and its background logic were driven by a desire to minimize posits; each innovation is pushed as far as it can be pushed before further innovations are introduced. For Quine, there is but one connective, the Sheffer stroke, and one quantifier, the universal quantifier. All polyadic predicates can be reduced to one dyadic predicate, interpretable as set membership. His rules of proof were limited to modus ponens and substitution. He preferred conjunction to either disjunction or the conditional, because conjunction has the least semantic ambiguity. He was delighted to discover early in his career that all of first order logic and set theory could be grounded in a mere two primitive notions: abstraction and inclusion. For an elegant introduction to the parsimony of Quine's approach to logic, see his \"New Foundations for Mathematical Logic,\" ch. 5 in his From a Logical Point of View.\n\nEpistemology\nJust as he challenged the dominant analytic\u2013synthetic distinction, Quine also took aim at traditional normative epistemology.  According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by Rudolf Carnap) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs:  \"Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input \u2014 certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance \u2014 and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output a description of the three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology.\" (Quine, 1969: 82\u20133)\n\nQuine's proposal is controversial among contemporary philosophers and has several critics, with Jaegwon Kim the most prominent among them.\"Naturalized Epistemology\". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Plato.stanford.edu. July 5, 2001. Accessed March 8, 2010.\n\nIn popular culture\n A computer program whose output is its own source code is called a \"quine\" after Quine. This usage was introduced by Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book, G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.\n Quine is a recurring character in the webcomic \"Existential Comics\"..

A day later, a similar agreement was reached with San Lorenzo for the sales of Bruno and Mauro Pitt\u00f3n. The departures of Br\u00edtez and Zabala were completed on 21 June, with the previously mentioned brothers following suit on 22 June. After four outgoings, Uni\u00f3n revealed their first incoming on 25 June in goalkeeper Sebasti\u00e1n Moyano from La Plata's Gimnasia y Esgrima. Jonatan Fleita's loan deal with Nueva Chicago was extended for a further season on 25 June. On 28 June, Uni\u00f3n communicated that they had earned $6.125m from the sales of Br\u00edtez, Zabala and the Pitt\u00f3n brothers.\n\nEzequiel Bonifacio joined the club on 29 June, signing from Gimnasia y Esgrima; \u00e0 la Moyano. A fifth player left on 30 June, as Franco Fragapane went to Talleres. Numerous loans from the previous campaign officially expired on and around 30 June. Franco Troyansky converted a penalty as Uni\u00f3n beat Godoy Cruz in a pre-season friendly on 3 July, though lost the secondary encounter by two goals. Dami\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, who spent the last two campaigns on loan from Independiente, was signed permanently on 3 July.

{"title": "Basis (linear algebra)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_%28linear_algebra%29", "text": "130px|thumb|The same vector can be represented in two different bases (purple and red arrows).\nIn mathematics, a set  of elements (vectors) in a vector space  is called a basis, if every element of  may be written in a unique way as a (finite) linear combination of elements of . The coefficients of this linear combination are referred to as components or coordinates on  of the vector. The elements of a basis are called .\n\nEquivalently  is a basis if its elements are linearly independent and every element of  is a linear combination of elements of .  In more general terms, a basis is a linearly independent spanning set.\n\nA vector space can have several bases; however all the bases have the same number of elements, called the dimension of the vector space.\n\n Definition \nA basis  of a vector space  over a field  (such as the real numbers  or the complex numbers ) is a linearly independent subset of  that spans .\nThis means that a subset  of  is a basis if it satisfies the two following conditions:\n the linear independence property:\n for every finite subset  of  and every  in  , if , then necessarily ;\n the spanning property:\n for every (vector)  in , it is possible to choose  in  and  in  such that .\n\nThe scalars  are called the coordinates of the vector  with respect to the basis , and by the first property they are uniquely determined.\n\nA vector space that has a finite basis is called finite-dimensional. In this case, the subset  that is considered (twice) in the above definition may be chosen as  itself.\n\nIt is often convenient or even necessary to have an ordering on the basis vectors, e.g. for discussing orientation, or when one considers the scalar coefficients of a vector with respect to a basis, without referring explicitly to the basis elements. In this case, the ordering is necessary for associating each coefficient to the corresponding basis element. This ordering can be done by numbering the basis elements. For example, when dealing with (m, n)-matrices, the  element (in the th row and th column) can be referred to the th element of a basis consisting of the (m, n)-unit-matrices (varying column-indices before row-indices). For emphasizing that an order has been chosen, one speaks of an ordered basis, which is therefore not simply an unstructured set, but e.g. a sequence, or an indexed family, or similar; see Ordered bases and coordinates below.\n\n Examples \nthumb|400px|This picture illustrates the standard basis in R2. The blue and orange vectors are the elements of the basis; the green vector can be given in terms of the basis vectors, and so is linearly dependent upon them.\nThe set  of the ordered pairs of real numbers is a vector space for the component-wise addition\n\nand scalar multiplication \n\nwhere  is any real number. A simple basis of this vector space, called the standard basis consists of the two vectors  and , since, any vector  of  may be uniquely written as\n\nAny other pair of linearly independent vectors of , such as  and , forms also a basis of R2.\nMore generally, if  is a field, the set  of -tuples of elements of  is a vector space for similarly defined addition and scalar multiplication. Let\n\n be the -tuple with all components equal to 0, except the th, which is 1. Then  is a basis of  which is called the standard basis of \nIf  is a field, the polynomial ring  of the polynomials in one indeterminate has a basis , called the monomial basis, consisting of all monomials:\n\nAny set of polynomials such that there is exactly one polynomial of each degree is also a basis. Such a set of polynomials is called a polynomial sequence. Example (among many) of such polynomial sequences are Bernstein basis polynomials, and Chebyshev polynomials.\n\n Properties \n\nMany properties of finite bases result from the Steinitz exchange lemma, which states that, given a finite spanning set  and a linearly independent subset  of  elements of , one may replace  well chosen elements of  by the elements of  for getting a spanning set containing , having its other elements in , and having the same number of elements as .\n\nMost properties resulting from the Steinitz exchange lemma remain true when there is no finite spanning set, but their proof in the infinite case requires generally the axiom of choice or a weaker form of it, such as the ultrafilter lemma.\n\nIf  is a vector space over a field , then:\n If  is a linearly independent subset of a spanning set , then there is a basis  such that \n\n  has a basis (this is the preceding property with  being the empty set, and ).\n All bases of  have the same cardinality, which is called the dimension of . This is the dimension theorem.\n A generating set  is a basis of  if and only if it is minimal, that is, no proper subset of  is also a generating set of .\n A linearly independent set  is a basis if and only if it is maximal, that is, it is not a proper subset of any linearly independent set.\n\nIf  is a vector space of dimension , then:\n A subset of  with  elements is a basis if and only if it is linearly independent.\n A subset of  with  elements is a basis if and only if it is spanning set of .\n\n Coordinates  \n\nLet  be a vector space of finite dimension  over a field , and \n\nbe a basis of . By definition of a basis, for every  in  may be written, in a unique way,\n\nwhere the coefficients  are scalars (that is, elements of ), which are called the coordinates of  over . However, if one talks of the set of the coefficients, one looses the correspondence between coefficients and basis elements, and several vectors may have the same set of coefficients. For example,  and  have the same set of coefficients , and are different. It is therefore often convenient to work with an ordered basis; this is typically done by indexing the basis elements by the first natural numbers. Then, the coordinates of a vector form a sequence similarly indexed, and a vector is completely characterized by the sequence of coordinates. An ordered basis is also called a frame, a word commonly used, in various contexts, for referring to a sequence of data allowing defining coordinates.\n\nLet, as usual,  be the set of the -tuples of elements of . This set is an -vector space, with addition and scalar multiplication defined component-wise. The map \n\nis a linear isomorphism from the vector space  onto . In other words,  is the coordinate space of , and the -tuple  is the coordinate vector of .\n\nThe inverse image by  of  is the -tuple  all of whose components are 0, except the th that is 1. The  form an ordered basis of  which is called its standard basis or canonical basis. The ordered basis  is the image by  of the canonical basis of  \n\nIt follows from what precedes that every ordered basis is the image by a linear isomorphism of the canonical basis of  and that every linear isomorphism from  onto  may be defined as the isomorphism that maps the canonical basis of  onto a given ordered basis of . In other words it is equivalent to define an ordered basis of , or a linear isomorphism from  onto .\n\n Change of basis \n\nLet  be a vector space of dimension  over a field . Given two (ordered) bases  and  of , it is often useful to express the coordinates of a vector  with respect to  in terms of the coordinates with respect to  This can be done by the change-of-basis formula, that is described below. The subscripts \"old\" and \"new\" have been chosen because it is customary to refer to  and  as the old basis and the new basis, respectively. It is useful to describe the old coordinates in terms of the new ones, because, in general, one has expressions involving the old coordinates, and if one wants to obtain equivalent expressions in terms of the new coordinates; this is obtained by replacing  the old coordinates by their expressions in terms of the new coordinates.\n\nTypically, the new basis vectors are given by their coordinates over the old basis, that is, \n\nIf  and  are the coordinates of a vector  over the old and the new basis respectively, the change-of-basis formula is \n\nfor .\n\nThis formula may be concisely written in matrix notation. Let  be the matrix of the  and\n and \nbe the column vectors of the coordinates of  in the old and the new basis respectively, then the formula for changing coordinates is\n\nThe formula can be proven by considering the decomposition of the vector  on the two bases: one has \n\nand\n\nThe change-of-basis formula results then from the uniqueness of the decomposition of a vector over a basis, here  that is\n\nfor .\n\n Related notions \nFree module\n \nIf one replaces the field occurring in the definition of a vector space by a ring, one gets the definition of a module. For modules, linear independence and spanning sets are defined exactly as for vector spaces, although \"generating set\" is more commonly used than that of \"spanning set\".\n\nLike for vector spaces, a basis of a module is a linearly independent subset that is also a generating set. A major difference with the theory of vector spaces is that not every module has a basis. A module that has a basis is called a free module. Free modules play a fundamental role in module theory, as they may be used for describing the structure of non-free modules through free resolutions.\n\nA module over the integers is exactly the same thing as an abelian group. Thus a free module over the integers is also a free abelian group. Free abelian groups have specific properties that are not shared by modules over other rings. Specifically, every subgroup of a free abelian group is a group, and, if  is a subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group  (that is an abelian group that has a finite basis), there is a basis  of  and an integer  such that  is a basis of , for some nonzero integers  For details, see .\n\n Analysis \nIn the context of infinite-dimensional vector spaces over the real or complex numbers, the term  (named after Georg Hamel) or algebraic basis can be used to refer to a basis as defined in this article. This is to make a distinction with other notions of \"basis\" that exist when infinite-dimensional vector spaces are endowed with extra structure. The most important alternatives are orthogonal bases on Hilbert spaces, Schauder bases, and Markushevich bases on normed linear spaces. In the case of the real numbers R viewed as a vector space over the field Q of rational numbers, Hamel bases are uncountable, and have specifically the cardinality of the continuum, which is the cardinal number  where  is the smallest infinite cardinal, the cardinal of the integers.\n\nThe common feature of the other notions is that they permit the taking of infinite linear combinations of the basis vectors in order to generate the space. This, of course, requires that infinite sums are meaningfully defined on these spaces, as is the case for topological vector spaces \u2013 a large class of vector spaces including e.g. Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, or Fr\u00e9chet spaces.\n\nThe preference of other types of bases for infinite-dimensional spaces is justified by the fact that the Hamel basis becomes \"too big\" in Banach spaces: If X is an infinite-dimensional normed vector space which is complete (i.e. X is  a Banach space), then any Hamel basis of X is necessarily uncountable. This is a consequence of the Baire category theorem. The completeness as well as infinite dimension are crucial assumptions in the previous claim. Indeed, finite-dimensional spaces have by definition finite bases and there are infinite-dimensional (non-complete) normed spaces which have countable Hamel bases. Consider  , the space of the sequences  of real numbers which have only finitely many non-zero elements, with the norm  Its standard basis, consisting of the sequences having only one non-zero element, which is equal to 1, is a countable Hamel basis.\n\n Example \nIn the study of Fourier series, one learns that the functions {1} \u222a { sin(nx), cos(nx) : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } are an \"orthogonal basis\" of the (real or complex) vector space of all (real or complex valued) functions on the interval [0, 2\u03c0] that are square-integrable on this interval, i.e., functions f satisfying\n\nThe functions {1} \u222a { sin(nx), cos(nx) : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } are linearly independent, and every function f that is square-integrable on [0, 2\u03c0] is an \"infinite linear combination\" of them, in the sense that\n\nfor suitable (real or complex) coefficients ak, bk.  But manyNote that one cannot say \"most\" because the cardinalities of the two sets (functions that can and cannot be represented with a finite number of basis functions) are the same. square-integrable functions cannot be represented as finite linear combinations of these basis functions, which therefore do not comprise a Hamel basis. Every Hamel basis of this space is much bigger than this merely countably infinite set of functions. Hamel bases of spaces of this kind are typically not useful, whereas orthonormal bases of these spaces are essential in Fourier analysis.\n\nGeometry\nThe geometric notions of an affine space, projective space, convex set, and cone have related notions of  basis. An affine basis for an n-dimensional affine space is  points in general linear position. A   is  points in general position, in a projective space of dimension n. A  of a polytope is the set of the vertices of its convex hull. A  consists of one point by edge of a polygonal cone. See also a Hilbert basis (linear programming).\n\nRandom basis\nFor a probability distribution in Rn with a probability density function, such as the equidistribution  in a n-dimensional ball with respect to Lebesgue measure, it can be shown that n randomly and independently chosen vectors will form a basis with probability one, which is due to the fact that n linearly dependent vectors x1, ..., xn in Rn should satisfy the equation  (zero determinant of the matrix with columns xi), and the set of zeros of a non-trivial polynomial has zero measure. This observation has led to techniques for approximating random bases.\n\nthumb|270px|Empirical distribution of lengths N of pairwise almost orthogonal chains of vectors that are independently randomly sampled from the n-dimensional cube  as a function of dimension, n. Boxplots show the second and third quartiles of this data for each n, red bars correspond to the medians, and blue stars indicate means. Red curve shows theoretical bound given by Eq. (1) and green curve shows a refined estimate. \n\nIt is difficult to check numerically the linear dependence or exact orthogonality. Therefore, the notion of \u03b5-orthogonality is used. For spaces with inner product,  x is  \u03b5-orthogonal to y if  (that is, cosine  of the angle between x and y is less than \u03b5).\n\nIn high dimensions, two independent random vectors are with high probability almost orthogonal, and the number of independent random vectors, which all are with given high probability pairwise almost orthogonal, grows exponentially with dimension. More precisely, consider equidistribution in n-dimensional ball. Choose N independent random vectors from a ball (they are independent and identically distributed). Let \u03b8 be a small positive number. Then for\n\nN random vectors are all pairwise \u03b5-orthogonal with probability . This N growth exponentially with dimension n and  for sufficiently big n. This property of random bases is a manifestation of the so-called measure concentration phenomenon.\n\nThe figure (right) illustrates distribution of lengths N of pairwise almost orthogonal chains of vectors that are independently randomly sampled from the n-dimensional cube  as a function of dimension, n. A point is first randomly selected in the cube. The second point is randomly chosen in the same cube. If the angle between the vectors was within  then the vector was retained. At the next step a new vector is generated in the same hypercube, and its angles with the previously generated vectors are evaluated. If these angles are within  then the vector is retained. The process is repeated until the chain of almost orthogonality breaks, and the number of such pairwise almost orthogonal vectors (length of the chain) is recorded. For each n, 20 pairwise almost orthogonal chains where constructed numerically for each dimension. Distribution of the length of these chains is presented.\n\nProof that every vector space has a basis\n\nLet V be any vector space over some field F.\nLet X be the set of all linearly independent subsets of V.\n\nThe set X is nonempty since the empty set is an independent subset of V,\nand it is partially ordered by inclusion, which is denoted, as usual, by .\n\nLet Y be a subset of X that is totally ordered by ,\nand let LY be the union of all the elements of Y (which are themselves certain subsets of V).\n\nSince (Y, \u2286) is totally ordered, every finite subset of LY is a subset of an element of Y,\nwhich is a linearly independent subset of V,\nand hence every finite subset of LY is linearly independent.\nThus LY is linearly independent, so LY is an element of X.\nTherefore, LY is an upper bound for Y in (X, \u2286):\nit is an element of X, that contains every element Y.\n\nAs X is nonempty, and every totally ordered subset of (X, \u2286) has an upper bound in X, Zorn's lemma asserts that X has a maximal element. In other words, there exists some element Lmax of X satisfying the condition that whenever Lmax \u2286 L for some element L of X, then L = Lmax.\n\nIt remains to prove that Lmax is a basis of V.  Since Lmax belongs to X, we already know that Lmax is a linearly independent subset of V.\n\nIf Lmax would not span V, there would exist some vector w of V that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of elements of Lmax (with coefficients in the field F). In particular, w cannot be an element of Lmax.\nLet Lw  =  Lmax \u222a {w}. This set is an element of X, that is, it is a linearly independent subset of V (because w is not in the span of Lmax, and Lmax is independent). As Lmax \u2286 Lw, and Lmax \u2260 Lw (because Lw contains the vector w that is not contained in Lmax), this contradicts the maximality of Lmax. Thus this shows that Lmax spans V.\n\nHence Lmax is linearly independent and spans V. It is thus a basis of V, and this proves that every vector space has a basis.\n\nThis proof relies on Zorn's lemma, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice. Conversely, it may be proved that if every vector space has a basis, then the axiom of choice is true; thus the two assertions are equivalent.\n\nSee also\n Change of basis\n Frame of a vector space\n Spherical basis\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nGeneral references\n \n \n \n\nHistorical references\n \n \n \n \n \n , reprint: \n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n Instructional videos from Khan Academy\nIntroduction to bases of subspaces\nProof that any subspace basis has same number of elements\n \n \n\nCategory:Linear algebra\nCategory:Articles containing proofs\nCategory:Matroid theory\nCategory:Axiom of choice"}
{"title": "David Lewis (philosopher)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_%28philosopher%29", "text": "David Kellogg Lewis (September 28, 1941\u00a0\u2013 October 14, 2001) was an American philosopher. Lewis taught briefly at UCLA and then at Princeton from 1970 until his death.  He is also closely associated with Australia, whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than thirty years. He made contributions in philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, philosophy of probability, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophical logic, and aesthetics. He is probably best known for his controversial modal realist stance: <br/ >(i) Possible worlds exist. <br/ >(ii) Every possible world is a concrete entity. <br/ >(iii) Any possible world is causally and spatiotemporally isolated from any other possible world. <br/ >(iv) Our world is among the possible worlds.\n\n Early life and education \nLewis was born in Oberlin, Ohio, to John D. Lewis, a Professor of Government at Oberlin College, and Ruth Ewart Kelloggs Lewis, a distinguished medieval historian. The formidable intellect for which he was known later in his life was already manifest during his years at Oberlin High School, when he attended college lectures in chemistry. He went on to Swarthmore College and spent a year at Oxford University (1959\u20131960), where he was tutored by Iris Murdoch and attended lectures by Gilbert Ryle, H.P. Grice, P.F. Strawson, and J.L. Austin. It was his year at Oxford that played a seminal role in his decision to study philosophy, and which made him the quintessentially analytic philosopher that he would soon become. Lewis went on to receive his Ph.D from Harvard in 1967, where he studied under W.V.O. Quine, many of whose views he came to repudiate. It was there that his connection with Australia was first established when he took a seminar with J.J.C. Smart, a leading Australian philosopher. \"I taught David Lewis,\" Smart would say in later years, \"Or rather, he taught me.\"\n\n Early work on convention \nLewis's first monograph was Convention: A Philosophical Study (1969), which is based on his doctoral dissertation and uses concepts of game theory to analyze the nature of social conventions; it won the American Philosophical Association's first Franklin Matchette Prize for the best book published in philosophy by a philosopher under 40 years old. Lewis claimed that social conventions, such as the convention in most states that one drives on the right (not on the left), the convention that the original caller will re-call if a phone conversation is interrupted, etc., are solutions to so-called \"'co-ordination problems'\". Co-ordination problems were at the time of Lewis's book an under-discussed kind of game-theoretical problem; most of the game-theoretical discussion had circulated around problems where the participants are in conflict, such as the prisoner's dilemma.\n\nCo-ordination problems are problematic, for, though the participants have common interests, there are several solutions. Sometimes, one of the solutions may be \"'salient'\", a concept invented by the game-theorist and economist Thomas Schelling (by whom Lewis was much inspired). For example, a co-ordination problem that has the form of a meeting may have a salient solution if there is only one possible spot to meet in town. But in most cases, we must rely on what Lewis calls \"precedent\" in order to get a salient solution. If both participants know that a particular co-ordination problem, say \"which side should we drive on?\" has been solved in the same way numerous times before, both know that both know this, both know that both know that both know this, etc. (this particular state Lewis calls common knowledge, and it has since been much discussed by philosophers and game theorists), then they will easily solve the problem. That they have solved the problem successfully will be seen by even more people, and thus the convention will spread in the society. A convention is thus a behavioural regularity that sustains itself because it serves the interests of everyone involved. Another important feature of a convention is that a convention could be entirely different: one could just as well drive on the left; it is more or less arbitrary that one drives on the right in the US, for example.\n\nLewis's main goal in the book, however, wasn't simply to provide an account of convention but rather to investigate the \"platitude that language is ruled by convention\" (Convention, p.\u00a01.) The last two chapters of the book (Signalling Systems and Conventions of Language; cf. also \"Languages and Language\", 1975) make the case that the use of a language in a population consists of conventions of truthfulness and trust among members of the population. Lewis recasts in this framework notions such as those of truth and analyticity, claiming that they are better understood as relations between sentences and a language, rather than as properties of sentences.\n\n Counterfactuals and modal realism \n\nLewis went on to publish Counterfactuals (1973), which contained an analysis of counterfactual conditionals in terms of the theory of possible worlds. According to Lewis, what makes a statement of the form\nHad I made that shot our team would have won the game.\ntrue is that in any world where I make the shot but the world is otherwise as similar as possible to the actual one, our team wins the game. If there is a world maximally similar to ours where I make the shot but our team still loses, the counterfactual is false. This treatment of counterfactuals is a variation or generalization of the one published by Robert Stalnaker a few years earlier, and consequently this kind of treatment is called the Stalnaker-Lewis theory.\n\nRealism about possible worlds\nWhat made Lewis's views about counterfactuals controversial is that whereas Stalnaker treated possible worlds as imaginary entities, \"made up\" for the sake of theoretical convenience, Lewis adopted a position his formal account of counterfactuals did not commit him to, namely modal realism. According to this view as Lewis formulated it, when we speak of a world where I made the shot that in this world I missed, we are speaking of a world just as real as this one, and although we say that in that world I made the shot, more precisely it is not I but a counterpart of mine that was successful.\n\nHe had already proposed this view in some of his earlier papers: \"Counterpart Theory and Quantified Modal Logic\" (1968), \"Anselm and Actuality\" (1970), and \"Counterparts of Persons and their Bodies\" (1971). The theory was widely considered implausible, but Lewis urged that it should be taken seriously. Most often the idea that there exists an infinite number of causally isolated universes, each as real as our own but different from it in some way, and that furthermore that alluding to objects in this universe as necessary in order to explain what makes certain counterfactual statements true but not others, meets with what Lewis calls the \"incredulous stare\" (Lewis, OPW, 2005, pg. 135\u2013137). Lewis defends and elaborates his theory of extreme modal realism, while insisting that there is nothing extreme about it, in On the Plurality of Worlds (1986). Lewis acknowledges that his theory is contrary to common sense, but believes that its advantages far outweigh this disadvantage, and that therefore we should not be hesitant to pay this price.\n\nAccording to Lewis, \"actual\" is merely an indexical label we give to a world when we locate ourselves in it. Things are necessarily true when they are true in all possible worlds. (Note that Lewis is not the first one to speak of possible worlds in this context. Leibniz and C.I. Lewis, for example, both speak of possible worlds as a way of thinking about possibility and necessity, and some of David Kaplan's early work is on the counterpart theory. Lewis's original suggestion was that all possible worlds are equally concrete, and the world in which we find ourselves is no more real than any other possible world.)\n\n Criticisms \nThis theory has faced a number of criticisms. In particular, it is not clear how we could know what goes on in other worlds. After all, they are causally disconnected from ours; we can't look into them to see what is going on there.Stalnaker, Inquiry, p. 49: \"But if other possible worlds are causally disconnected from us, how do we know anything about them?\" A related objection is that, while people are concerned with what they could have done, they are not concerned with what some people in other worlds, no matter how similar to them, do. As Saul Kripke once put it, a presidential candidate could not care less whether someone else, in another world, wins an election, but does care whether he himself could have won it (Kripke 1980, p.\u00a045). A more basic criticism is that introducing so many entities into our ontology violates the maxim of Occam's razor, which tells us not to multiply theoretical entities beyond what is necessary to explain the facts our theories aim to explain.\n\nPossible worlds are employed in the work of Saul Kripke\"Naming and Necessity\", In Semantics of Natural Language, edited by D. Davidson and G. Harman. 1980 (1972) Dordrecht; Boston: Reidel. and many others, but not in the concrete sense propounded by Lewis. While none of these alternative approaches has found anything near universal acceptance, very few philosophers accept Lewis's particular brand of modal realism.\n\n Influence \nAt Princeton, Lewis was a mentor of young philosophers, and trained dozens of successful figures in the field, including several current Princeton faculty members, as well as people now teaching at a number of the leading philosophy departments in the U.S. Among his most prominent students are Bob Brandom at the University of Pittsburgh, L.A. Paul at Yale, Cian Dorr and David Velleman at NYU, Peter Railton at Michigan, and Joshua Greene at Harvard. His direct and indirect influence is evident in the work of many prominent philosophers of the current generation.\n\n Later life and death \n\nLewis suffered from severe diabetes for much of his life, which eventually grew worse and led to kidney failure. In July 2000 he received a kidney transplant from his wife Stephanie. The transplant allowed him to work and travel for another year, before he died suddenly and unexpectedly from further complications of his diabetes, on October 14, 2001.\n\nSince his death a number of posthumous papers have been published, on topics ranging from truth and causation to philosophy of physics. Lewisian Themes, a collection of papers on his philosophy, was published in 2004.\n\n Works \n Books \nConvention: A Philosophical Study, Harvard University Press 1969.\nCounterfactuals, Harvard University Press 1973; revised printing Blackwell 1986.\nSemantic Analysis: Essays Dedicated to Stig Kanger on His Fiftieth Birthday, Reidel 1974.\nOn the Plurality of Worlds, Blackwell 1986.\nParts of Classes, Blackwell 1991.\n\nLewis published five volumes containing 99 papers\u00a0\u2014 almost all of the papers he published during his lifetime.

{"title": "Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_for_the_Adoption_of_an_International_Auxiliary_Language", "text": "The Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language (French: D\u00e9l\u00e9gation pour l'Adoption d'une Langue Auxiliaire Internationale) was a body of academics convened in the early part of the 1900s (decade) to decide on the issue of which international auxiliary language should be chosen for international use. The ultimate decision of the committee charged by the Delegation was to adopt the Esperanto language, but with certain reforms. The result became a distinct language known as Ido.\n\nCreation\nThe Delegation was founded in 1901 by French academics Louis Couturat and L\u00e9opold Leau, who had noted the language difficulties arising among international bodies convening during the 1900 World's Fair in Paris.Document sans titre  Working with European esperantists, they gathered support for the Delegation from professional societies, companies, and universities.\n\nAmong the chief aims of the Delegation were to select a language to be taught alongside \"natural languages\" and allow written and spoken communication in an international environment. Three conditions were laid out for the language to be chosen:\n\nIt must be capable of serving the needs of science, in addition to everyday life, commerce and general communication,\nIt must be able to be easily learned by all people of average education, and especially those of the civilized nations of Europe, and\nIt must not be a living language.\n\nIn June 1907, the Delegation convened and refused to decide the ultimate issue, but rather, at Couturat's insistence, created a committee to make the decision.\n\nThe Committee\nThe Delegation Committee arranged to meet in Paris in October 1907. Supporters of Esperanto, including its author L. L. Zamenhof, warned Couturat that the committee had no authority to impose an international language, but they had received assurances from Couturat that Esperanto would be chosen anyway.The Esperanto Book: 3 Zamenhof to Couturat: 21. I. 1907 The members of the Committee were:\n\nManuel Barrios, President of the Peruvian Senate\nJan Baudouin de Courtenay, Professor of Linguistics, University of St. Petersburg\n\u00c9mile Boirac, University of Dijon, author and Esperanto supporter known for the phrase d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nCharles Jacques Bouchard, Professor, Paris College of Medicine\nLor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, Hungarian Academy of Sciences\nWilhelm F\u00f6rster, President of the International Committee for Weights and Measures\nCol.

Esperanto was represented by Louis de Beaufront, an active supporter of the language. Other languages, such as Bolak, Spokil and Idiom Neutral received the attention of the committee.\n\nTowards the end of the Committee's meeting, committee members received a proposal by an anonymous author identified as \"Ido\" (I.D. in Esperanto, possibly for Internacia Delegacio International Delegation, but also meaning \"offspring\" in Esperanto). The proposal reformed Esperanto in a number of ways, including removing circumflexed letters, dropping the mandatory accusative ending and reforming the plural. The reforms were endorsed by Esperanto's representative, de Beaufront.\n\nThe decision of the committee was to adopt Esperanto in principle, but with the reforms spelled out by Ido. A permanent commission was set up to see the implementation of the reforms. The anonymous \"Ido\", author of the reform project, was later revealed to be Louis de Beaufront, acting in concert with Louis Couturat.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe commission delivered an ultimatum to the Esperanto Language Committee, the nearest approximate to a governing body of the Esperanto movement at the time. A response was demanded in one month, but this was logistically impossible as members of the Language Committee spread out all over Europe and beyond. After a month passed with no response, the commission broke relations with the Esperantists.\n\nA number of Esperantists did migrate to the movement, including a number of influential leaders of the movement, but most ordinary speakers did not support the Ido reforms. This prompted the observation from outsiders that the Idists were generals without an army, and the Esperantists were an army with no generals. Less than a year later, the Universala Esperanto-Asocio was created to provide stronger leadership within the Esperanto movement, which had not received organizational guidance from its inventor, Dr. Zamenhof. While Esperantists have little regard for the Delegation and its decisions, partisans of Ido continue to insist that the Delegation Committee was legitimate. The Truth about the Delegation in 1907 The Ido language even today still has a following.http://www.idolinguo.com/ The Uniono por la Linguo Internaciona Ido organizes annual conventions of Ido speakers and supporters \n\nThe Encyclopedia of Esperanto summarizes the Esperantists' position as follows: \n\nLa \"Delegitaro\" estis unu-homa afero, sen kunvenoj a\u016d difinita regularo. La unu klara regulo, ke a\u016dtoroj de lingvoprojekto ne rajtas partopreni, estis rompita. El la 12 membroj de la komitato nur du estis lingvistoj, kaj nur 4 partoprenis; oni aldonis nomojn de anstata\u016dantoj a\u016d novaj membroj sen rajtigo. La fina rezolucio estis vo\u0109donita de nur tri el la 12 plus 4 anstata\u016dantaj kaj la sekretarioj. Oni sendis al la L. K. 25 kopiojn de la projekto, por disdoni ilin inter 100 membroj de la L. K. (lo\u011dantaj anka\u016d ekster E\u016dropo) kaj postulis respondon post unu monato.\n\nThe \"Delegation\" was a one-man enterprise, without meetings or a definitive set of rules. The one clear rule, that authors of language projects have no right to participate, was broken. Of the 12 members of the committee, only two were linguists, and only four participated; they added names of substitutes or new members without permission. The final resolution was voted upon by only three of the twelve plus four substitutes and the secretaries. They sent to the L.K. (Esperanto Language Committee) 25 copies of the project, to distribute among its 100 members (some of whom were living outside of Europe) and demanded a response in one month.\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\nEsperantido\nEsperanto and Ido compared\nCriticism of Esperanto\n\nCategory:International organizations based in France\nCategory:International auxiliary languages\nCategory:Organizations established in 1901"}

Tessellation refer to a finite number of objects/cells that cover the surface as discrete partitions while Lattice refer to ordered sets of points that cover the surface in continuous vector space. The mathematical frame for a digital Earth reference model is a tessellation while the mathematical frame for an analog Earth reference is a lattice.\n\nThe value of a digital Earth reference model to encode information about the Earth is akin to the value obtained from other digital technologies, namely synchronization of the physical domain with the information domain, such as in digital audio and digital photography.  Efficiencies are found in  data storage, processing, integration, discovery, transmission, visualization, aggregation, and analytical, fusion and modeling transforms.  Data reference to a Digital Earth Reference Model (DERM) becomes ubiquitous facilitating distributed spatial queries such as \u201cWhat is here?\u201d and \u201cWhat has changed?\u201d.  Image and signal processing theory can be utilized to operate on data referenced to a DERM.\n\nThe DERM structure is data independent allowing for the general quantization of all georeferenced data sources onto the common grid.  Application, algorithms and operations can then be developed on the grid independent of data sources.\n\nApproaches using an analog reference require rigorous manual conflation to satisfy the creation of digital products such as digital maps or other cartographic, navigation or geospatial information (see also GIS).  However, digital models are weaker at geometric transformations where translation, scaling and rotation must conform to the discrete cell locations wherein on an analog model with a continuum of locations geometric transformation are straight forward with no requirements for reprocessing or resampling.\n\nA cell shape in such representations can be critical to the validity, adaptability and usefulness of the grid.  As rectilinear structures are intuitive but lack optimization characteristics as a tessellation especially when tiled to a sphere, other schemes including voronoi regions, peano curves, triangles and hexagonal tilings have been advanced as superior alternatives.\n \nMany ordering and naming models have been implemented as geospatial database indexing for efficient data retrieval (R-Trees, QTM, HHC).  Few of these models have encompassed a complete digital Earth reference model where both a formation of digits that represent a hierarchy where the index contains a parent child relationship and a formation of digits that monotonically converges by a set modulus to all vector Reals.\n\nThe International Society on Digital Earth has a standing committee considering DERM implementations and standards which includes both the Earth reference frame and the ancillary requirements for metadata and attribute semantics.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Geographic information systems"}

{"title": "Elementary equivalence", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_equivalence", "text": "In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, two structures M and N of the same signature \u03c3 are called elementarily equivalent if they satisfy the same first-order \u03c3-sentences.\n\nIf N is a substructure of M, one often needs a stronger condition. In this case N is called an elementary substructure of M if every first-order \u03c3-formula \u03c6(a1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0an) with parameters a1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0an from N is true in N if and only if it is true in\u00a0M.\nIf N is an elementary substructure of M, M is called an elementary extension of\u00a0N. An embedding h:\u00a0N\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M is called an elementary embedding of N into M if h(N) is an elementary substructure of\u00a0M.\n\nA substructure N of M is elementary if and only if it passes the Tarski\u2013Vaught test: every first-order formula \u03c6(x,\u00a0b1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0bn) with parameters in N that has a solution in M also has a solution in\u00a0N when evaluated in\u00a0M. One can prove that two structures are elementary equivalent with the Ehrenfeucht\u2013Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games.\n\nElementarily equivalent structures\nTwo structures M and N of the same signature\u00a0\u03c3 are elementarily equivalent if every first-order sentence (formula without free variables) over\u00a0\u03c3 is true in M if and only if it is true in N, i.e. if M and N have the same complete first-order theory.\nIf M and N are elementarily equivalent, one writes M\u00a0\u2261\u00a0N.\n\nA first-order theory is complete if and only if any two of its models are elementarily equivalent.\n\nFor example, consider the language with one binary relation symbol '<'.  The model R of real numbers with its usual order and the model Q of rational numbers with its usual order are elementarily equivalent, since they both interpret '<' as an unbounded dense linear ordering. This is sufficient to ensure elementary equivalence, because the theory of unbounded dense linear orderings is complete, as can be shown by Vaught's test.\n\nMore generally, any first-order theory with an infinite model has non-isomorphic, elementary equivalent models, which can be obtained via the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem. Thus, for example, there are non-standard models of Peano arithmetic, which contain other objects than just the numbers 0, 1, 2, etc., and yet are elementarily equivalent to the standard model.\n\nElementary substructures and elementary extensions\nN is an elementary substructure of M if N and M are structures of the same signature\u00a0\u03c3 such that for all first-order \u03c3-formulas \u03c6(x1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0xn) with free variables x1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0xn, and all elements a1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0an of\u00a0N, \u03c6(a1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0an) holds in N if and only if it holds in M:\nN  \u03c6(a1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0an) iff M  \u03c6(a1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0an).\nIt follows that N is a substructure of M.\n\nIf N is a substructure of M, then both N and M can be interpreted as structures in the signature \u03c3N consisting of \u03c3 together with a new constant symbol for every element of\u00a0N. N is an elementary substructure of M if and only if N is a substructure of M and N and M are elementarily equivalent as \u03c3N-structures.\n\nIf N is an elementary substructure of M, one writes N  M and says that M is an elementary extension of N: M  N.\n\nThe downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem gives a countable elementary substructure for any infinite first-order structure in at most countable signature; the upward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem gives elementary extensions of any infinite first-order structure of arbitrarily large cardinality.\n\nTarski\u2013Vaught test\nThe Tarski\u2013Vaught test (or Tarski\u2013Vaught criterion) is a necessary and sufficient condition for a substructure N of a structure M to be an elementary substructure. It can be useful for constructing an elementary substructure of a large structure.\n\nLet M be a structure of signature \u03c3 and N a substructure of M. N is an elementary substructure of M if and only if for every first-order formula \u03c6(x,\u00a0y1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0yn) over \u03c3 and all elements b1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0bn from N, if M  x\u00a0\u03c6(x,\u00a0b1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0bn), then there is an element a in N such that M \u03c6(a,\u00a0b1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0bn).\n\nElementary embeddings\nAn elementary embedding of a structure N into a structure M of the same signature \u03c3 is a map h:\u00a0N\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M such that for every first-order \u03c3-formula \u03c6(x1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0xn) and all elements a1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0an of\u00a0N, \nN  \u03c6(a1,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0an) if and only if M  \u03c6(h(a1),\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0h(an)).\nEvery elementary embedding is a strong homomorphism, and its image is an elementary substructure.\n\nElementary embeddings are the most important maps in model theory.

This is similar to EFA and has the same proof theoretic strength, but is more cumbersome to work with.\n\nThere are weak fragments of second-order arithmetic called RCA and WKL that have the same consistency strength as EFA and are conservative over it for \u03a0 sentences, which are sometimes studied in reverse mathematics .\n\nElementary recursive arithmetic (ERA) is a subsystem of primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA) in which recursion is restricted to bounded sums and products. This also has the same \u03a0 sentences as EFA, in the sense that whenever EFA proves \u2200x\u2203y P(x,y), with P quantifier-free, ERA proves the open formula P(x,T(x)), with T a term definable in ERA. Like PRA, ERA can be defined in an entirely logic-free manner, with just the rules of substitution and induction, and defining equations for all elementary recursive functions. Unlike PRA, however, the elementary recursive functions can be characterized by the closure under composition and projection of a finite number of basis functions, and thus only a finite number of defining equations are needed.\n\n See also \n\nGrzegorczyk hierarchy\nReverse mathematics\nTarski's high school algebra problem\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Formal theories of arithmetic\nCategory:Proof theory\nCategory:Conjectures"}

{"title": "Fast-growing hierarchy", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-growing_hierarchy", "text": "In computability theory, computational complexity theory and proof theory, a fast-growing hierarchy (also called an extended Grzegorczyk hierarchy) is an ordinal-indexed family of rapidly increasing functions f\u03b1: N \u2192 N (where N is the set of natural numbers {0, 1, ...}, and \u03b1 ranges up to some large countable ordinal). A primary example is the Wainer hierarchy, or L\u00f6b\u2013Wainer hierarchy, which is an extension to all \u03b1 < \u03b50.  Such hierarchies provide a natural way to classify computable functions according to rate-of-growth and computational complexity.\n\nDefinition\nLet \u03bc be a large countable ordinal such to every limit ordinal \u03b1 < \u03bc there is assigned a fundamental sequence (a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals whose supremum is \u03b1).  A fast-growing hierarchy of functions f\u03b1: N \u2192 N, for \u03b1 < \u03bc, is then defined as follows:\n\n if \u03b1 is a limit ordinal.\n\nHere f\u03b1n(n) =  f\u03b1(f\u03b1(...(f\u03b1(n))...)) denotes the nth iterate of  f\u03b1 applied to n, and \u03b1[n] denotes the nth element of the fundamental sequence assigned to the limit ordinal \u03b1.  (An alternative definition takes the number of iterations to be n+1, rather than n, in the second line above.)\n\nThe initial part of this hierarchy, comprising the functions f\u03b1 with finite index (i.e., \u03b1 < \u03c9), is often called the Grzegorczyk hierarchy because of its close relationship to the Grzegorczyk hierarchy; note, however, that the former is here an indexed family of functions fn, whereas the latter is an indexed family of sets of functions . (See Points of Interest below.)\n\nGeneralizing the above definition even further, a fast iteration hierarchy is obtained by taking f0 to be any increasing function g: N \u2192 N.\n\nFor limit ordinals not greater than \u03b50, there is a straightforward natural definition of the fundamental sequences (see the Wainer hierarchy below), but beyond \u03b50 the definition is much more complicated.  However, this is possible well beyond the Feferman\u2013Sch\u00fctte ordinal, \u03930, up to at least the Bachmann\u2013Howard ordinal. Using Buchholz psi functions one can extend this definition easily to the ordinal of transfinitely iterated -comprehension (see Analytical hierarchy).\n\nA fully specified extension beyond the recursive ordinals is thought to be unlikely; e.g., Pr\u04e7mel et al. [1991](p.\u00a0348) note that in such an attempt \"there would even arise problems in ordinal notation\".\n\nThe Wainer hierarchy\n\nThe Wainer hierarchy is the particular fast-growing hierarchy of functions f\u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b50) obtained by defining the fundamental sequences as follows [Gallier 1991][Pr\u04e7mel, et al., 1991]:\n\nFor limit ordinals \u03bb < \u03b50, written in Cantor normal form,\n\n if \u03bb = \u03c9\u03b11 + ... + \u03c9\u03b1k\u22121 + \u03c9\u03b1k for \u03b11 \u2265 ... \u2265 \u03b1k\u22121 \u2265 \u03b1k, then \u03bb[n] = \u03c9\u03b11 + ... + \u03c9\u03b1k\u22121 + \u03c9\u03b1k[n],\n if \u03bb = \u03c9\u03b1+1, then \u03bb[n] = \u03c9\u03b1n,\n if \u03bb = \u03c9\u03b1 for a limit ordinal \u03b1, then \u03bb[n] = \u03c9\u03b1[n],\n\nand\n\n if \u03bb = \u03b50, take \u03bb[0] = 0 and \u03bb[n + 1] = \u03c9\u03bb[n] as in [Gallier 1991]; alternatively, take the same sequence except starting with \u03bb[0] = 1 as in [Pr\u04e7mel, et al., 1991]. For n > 0, the alternative version has one additional \u03c9 in the resulting exponential tower, i.e. \u03bb[n] = \u03c9\u03c9...\u03c9 with n omegas.\n\nSome authors use slightly different definitions (e.g., \u03c9\u03b1+1[n] = \u03c9\u03b1(n+1), instead of \u03c9\u03b1n), and some define this hierarchy only for \u03b1 < \u03b50 (thus excluding f\u03b50 from the hierarchy).\n\nTo continue beyond \u03b50, see the Fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy.\n\nPoints of interest\n\nFollowing are some relevant points of interest about fast-growing hierarchies:\n\n Every f\u03b1 is a total function.  If the fundamental sequences are computable (e.g., as in the Wainer hierarchy), then every f\u03b1 is a total computable function.\n In the Wainer hierarchy, f\u03b1 is dominated by f\u03b2 if \u03b1 < \u03b2. (For any two functions f, g: N \u2192 N, f is said to dominate g if f(n) > g(n) for all sufficiently large n.)  The same property holds in any fast-growing hierarchy with fundamental sequences satisfying the so-called Bachmann property. (This property holds for most natural well orderings.)\n In the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, every primitive recursive function is dominated by some f\u03b1 with \u03b1 < \u03c9.  Hence, in the Wainer hierarchy, every primitive recursive function is dominated by f\u03c9, which is a variant of the Ackermann function.\n For n \u2265 3, the set  in the Grzegorczyk hierarchy is composed of just those total multi-argument functions which, for sufficiently large arguments, are computable within time bounded by some fixed iterate fn-1k evaluated at the maximum argument.\n In the Wainer hierarchy, every f\u03b1 with \u03b1 < \u03b50 is computable and provably total in Peano arithmetic.\n Every computable function that's provably total in Peano arithmetic is dominated by some f\u03b1 with \u03b1 < \u03b50 in the Wainer hierarchy.  Hence f\u03b50 in the Wainer hierarchy is not provably total in Peano arithmetic.\n The Goodstein function has approximately the same growth rate (i.e. each is dominated by some fixed iterate of the other) as f\u03b50 in the Wainer hierarchy, dominating every f\u03b1 for which \u03b1 < \u03b50, and hence is not provably total in Peano Arithmetic.\n In the Wainer hierarchy, if \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u03b50, then f\u03b2 dominates every computable function within time and space bounded by some fixed iterate f\u03b1k.\n Friedman's TREE function dominates f\u03930 in a fast-growing hierarchy described by Gallier (1991).\n The Wainer hierarchy of functions f\u03b1 and the Hardy hierarchy of functions h\u03b1 are related by f\u03b1 = h\u03c9\u03b1 for all \u03b1 < \u03b50.  The Hardy hierarchy \"catches up\" to the Wainer hierarchy at \u03b1 = \u03b50, such that f\u03b50 and h\u03b50 have the same growth rate, in the sense that f\u03b50(n-1) \u2264 h\u03b50(n) \u2264 f\u03b50(n+1) for all n \u2265 1. (Gallier 1991)\n  and Cichon & Wainer (1983) showed that the slow-growing hierarchy of functions g\u03b1 attains the same growth rate as the function f\u03b50 in the Wainer hierarchy when \u03b1 is the Bachmann\u2013Howard ordinal. Girard (1981) further showed that the slow-growing hierarchy g\u03b1 attains the same growth rate  as f\u03b1 (in a particular fast-growing hierarchy) when \u03b1 is the ordinal of the theory ID<\u03c9 of arbitrary finite iterations of an inductive definition. (Wainer 1989)\n\nFunctions in fast-growing hierarchies\n\nThe functions at finite levels (\u03b1 < \u03c9) of any fast-growing hierarchy coincide with those of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy: (using hyperoperation)\n\n f0(n) = n + 1 = 2 [1] n \u2212 1\n f1(n) = f0n(n) = n + n = 2n = 2 [2] n\n f2(n) = f1n(n) = 2n \u00b7 n > 2n = 2 [3] n for n \u2265 2\n fk+1(n) = fkn(n) > (2 [k + 1])n n \u2265 2 [k + 2] n for n \u2265 2, k < \u03c9.\n\nBeyond the finite levels are the functions of the Wainer hierarchy (\u03c9 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b50):\n\n f\u03c9(n) = fn(n) > 2 [n + 1] n > 2 [n] (n + 3) \u2212 3 = A(n, n) for n \u2265 4, where A is the Ackermann function (of which f\u03c9 is a unary version).\n f\u03c9+1(n) = f\u03c9n(n) \u2265 fn [n + 2] n(n) for all n > 0, where n [n + 2] n is the nth Ackermann number.\n f\u03c9+1(64) > f\u03c964(6) > Graham's number (= g64 in the sequence defined by g0 = 4, gk+1 = 3 [gk + 2] 3).  This follows by noting f\u03c9(n) > 2 [n + 1] n > 3 [n] 3 + 2, and hence f\u03c9(gk + 2) > gk+1 + 2.\n f\u03b50(n) is the first function in the Wainer hierarchy that dominates the Goodstein function.\n\nApproximate growth rates in comparison to other googological notations\n\n (see Knuth's up-arrow notation)\n\n (see Bird's Array Notation)\n\n (m entries)\n (n entries) \n\nReferences\n Buchholz, W.; Wainer, S.S (1987). \"Provably Computable Functions and the Fast Growing Hierarchy\".

{"title": "Finitism", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism", "text": "Finitism is a philosophy of mathematics that accepts the existence only of finite mathematical objects. It is best understood in comparison to the mainstream philosophy of mathematics where infinite mathematical objects (e.g., infinite sets) are accepted as legitimate.\n\n Main idea \nThe main idea of finitistic mathematics is not accepting the existence of infinite objects such as infinite sets. While all natural numbers are accepted as existing, the set of all natural numbers is not considered to exist as a mathematical object. Therefore quantification over infinite domains is not considered meaningful. The mathematical theory often associated with finitism is Thoralf Skolem's primitive recursive arithmetic.\n\n History \nThe introduction of infinite mathematical objects occurred a few centuries ago when the use of infinite objects was already a controversial topic among mathematicians. The issue entered a new phase when Georg Cantor in 1874 introduced what is now called naive set theory and used it as a base for his work on transfinite numbers. When paradoxes such as Russell's paradox, Berry's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox were discovered in Cantor's naive set theory, the issue became a heated topic among mathematicians.\n\nThere were various positions taken by mathematicians. All agreed about finite mathematical objects such as natural numbers. However there were disagreements regarding infinite mathematical objects. \nOne position was the intuitionistic mathematics that was advocated by L. E. J. Brouwer, which rejected the existence of infinite objects until they are constructed.\n\nAnother position was endorsed by David Hilbert: finite mathematical objects are concrete objects, infinite mathematical objects are ideal objects, and accepting ideal mathematical objects does not cause a problem regarding finite mathematical objects. More formally, Hilbert believed that it is possible to show that any theorem about finite mathematical objects that can be obtained using ideal infinite objects can be also obtained without them. Therefore allowing infinite mathematical objects would not cause a problem regarding finite objects. This led to Hilbert's program of proving consistency of set theory using finitistic means as this would imply that adding ideal mathematical objects is conservative over the finitistic part. Hilbert's views are also associated with the formalist philosophy of mathematics. Hilbert's goal of proving the consistency of set theory or even arithmetic through finitistic means turned out to be an impossible task due to Kurt G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems. However, by Harvey Friedman's grand conjecture most mathematical results should be provable using finitistic means.\n\nHilbert did not give a rigorous explanation of what he considered finitistic and refer to as elementary. However, based on his work with Paul Bernays some experts such as William Tait have argued that the primitive recursive arithmetic can be considered an upper bound on what Hilbert considered finitistic mathematics.\n\nIn the years following G\u00f6del's theorems, as it became clear that there is no hope of proving consistency of mathematics, and with development of axiomatic set theories such as Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory and the lack of any evidence against its consistency, most mathematicians lost interest in the topic. Today most classical mathematicians are considered Platonist and readily use infinite mathematical objects and a set-theoretical universe.\n\n Classical finitism vs. strict finitism \nIn her book Philosophy of Set Theory, Mary Tiles characterized those who allow potentially infinite objects as classical finitists, and those who do not allow potentially infinite objects as strict finitists: for example, a classical finitist would allow statements such as \"every natural number has a successor\" and would accept the meaningfulness of infinite series in the sense of limits of finite partial sums, while a strict finitist would not. Historically, the written history of mathematics was thus classically finitist until Cantor created the hierarchy of transfinite cardinals at the end of the 19th century.\n\n Views regarding infinite mathematical objects \nLeopold Kronecker remained a strident opponent to Cantor's set theory:\n\nReuben Goodstein was another proponent of finitism.  Some of his work involved building up to analysis from finitist foundations.\n\nAlthough he denied it, much of Ludwig Wittgenstein's writing on mathematics has a strong affinity with finitism. \n\nIf finitists are contrasted with transfinitists (proponents of e.g. Georg Cantor's hierarchy of infinities), then also Aristotle may be characterized as a strict finitist. Aristotle especially promoted the potential infinity as a middle option between strict finitism and actual infinity (the latter being an actualization of something never-ending in nature, in contrast with the Cantorist actual infinity consisting of the transfinite cardinal and ordinal numbers, which have nothing to do with the things in nature):\n\n Other related philosophies of mathematics \nUltrafinitism (also known as ultraintuitionism) has an even more conservative attitude towards mathematical objects than finitism, and has objections to the existence of finite mathematical objects when they are too large.\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century John Penn Mayberry developed a system of finitary mathematics which he called \"Euclidean Arithmetic\". The most striking tenet of his system is a complete and rigorous rejection of the special foundational status normally accorded to iterative processes, including in particular the construction of the natural numbers by the iteration \"+1\". Consequently Mayberry is in sharp dissent from those who would seek to equate finitary mathematics with Peano Arithmetic or any of its fragments such as primitive recursive arithmetic.\n\n See also \n Rational trigonometry\n Temporal finitism\n Transcomputational problem\n Finitist set theory\n\n References \n\nFurther reading\n \n\n External links \n \n\nCategory:Constructivism (mathematics)\nCategory:Infinity\nCategory:Epistemological theories"}

The \u03b2 function is used, in particular, in showing that the class of arithmetically definable functions is closed under primitive recursion, and therefore includes all primitive recursive functions.\n\nThe  \u03b2 function has been introduced  without the name in the proof of the first of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems (G\u00f6del 1931). The  \u03b2 function lemma given below is an essential step of that proof. G\u00f6del gave the  \u03b2 function its name in (G\u00f6del 1934). \n\n Definition \n\nThe  function takes three natural numbers as arguments. It is defined as\n\nwhere  denotes the remainder after integer division of  by  (Mendelson 1997:186).\n\n Properties \n\nThe \u03b2 function is arithmetically definable in an obvious way, because it uses only arithmetic operations and the remainder function which is arithmetically definable. It is therefore representable in Robinson arithmetic and stronger theories such as Peano arithmetic. By fixing the first two arguments appropriately, one can arrange that the values obtained by varying the final argument from 0 to n run through any specified (n+1)-tuple of natural numbers (the \u03b2 lemma described in detail below). This allows simulating the quantification over sequences of natural numbers of arbitrary length, which cannot be done directly in the language of arithmetic, by quantification over just two numbers, to be used as the first two arguments of the \u03b2 function.\n\nConcretely, if f is a function defined by primitive recursion on a parameter n, say by f(0) = c and f(n+1) = g(n, f(n)), then to express f(n) = y one would like to say: there exists a sequence a0, a1, \u2026, an such that a0 = c,  an = y and for all i < n one has g(i, ai) = ai+1. While that is not possible directly, one can say instead: there exist natural numbers a and b such that \u03b2(a,b,0) = c, \u03b2(a,b,n) = y and for all i < n one has g(i, \u03b2(a,b,i)) = \u03b2(a,b,i+1).\n\n The \u03b2 function lemma \n\nThe utility of the \u03b2 function comes from the following result, which is the purpose of the \u03b2 function in G\u00f6del's incompleteness proof (G\u00f6del 1931).

{"title": "Hilbert space", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space", "text": "thumb|The state of a vibrating string can be modeled as a point in a Hilbert space. The decomposition of a vibrating string into its vibrations in distinct overtones is given by the projection of the point onto the coordinate axes in the space.\n\nThe mathematical concept of a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.\n\nHilbert spaces arise naturally and frequently in mathematics and physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied from this point of view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer), and ergodic theory (which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics). John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.\n\nGeometric intuition plays an important role in many aspects of Hilbert space theory. Exact analogs of the Pythagorean theorem and parallelogram law hold in a Hilbert space. At a deeper level, perpendicular projection onto a subspace (the analog of \"dropping the altitude\" of a triangle) plays a significant role in optimization problems and other aspects of the theory. An element of a Hilbert space can be uniquely specified by its coordinates with respect to a set of coordinate axes (an orthonormal basis), in analogy with Cartesian coordinates in the plane. When that set of axes is countably infinite, the Hilbert space can also be usefully thought of in terms of the space of infinite sequences that are square-summable. The latter space is often in the older literature referred to as the Hilbert space. Linear operators on a Hilbert space are likewise fairly concrete objects: in good cases, they are simply transformations that stretch the space by different factors in mutually perpendicular directions in a sense that is made precise by the study of their spectrum.\n\nDefinition and illustration\n\nMotivating example: Euclidean space\nOne of the most familiar examples of a Hilbert space is the Euclidean space consisting of three-dimensional vectors, denoted by , and equipped with the dot product. The dot product takes two vectors  and , and produces a real number . If  and  are represented in Cartesian coordinates, then the dot product is defined by\n\nThe dot product satisfies the properties:\n It is symmetric in  and : .\n It is linear in its first argument:  for any scalars , , and vectors , , and .\n It is positive definite: for all vectors , , with equality if and only if .\n\nAn operation on pairs of vectors that, like the dot product, satisfies these three properties is known as a (real) inner product. A vector space equipped with such an inner product is known as a (real) inner product space. Every finite-dimensional inner product space is also a Hilbert space. The basic feature of the dot product that connects it with Euclidean geometry is that it is related to both the length (or norm) of a vector, denoted , and to the angle  between two vectors  and  by means of the formula\n\nthumb|right|Completeness means that if a particle moves along the broken path (in blue) travelling a finite total distance, then the particle has a well-defined net displacement (in orange).\nMultivariable calculus in Euclidean space relies on the ability to compute limits, and to have useful criteria for concluding that limits exist. A mathematical series\n \n\nconsisting of vectors in  is absolutely convergent provided that the sum of the lengths converges as an ordinary series of real numbers:\n \n\nJust as with a series of scalars, a series of vectors that converges absolutely also converges to some limit vector  in the Euclidean space, in the sense that\n \n\nThis property expresses the completeness of Euclidean space: that a series that converges absolutely also converges in the ordinary sense.\n\nHilbert spaces are often taken over the complex numbers. The complex plane denoted by  is equipped with a notion of magnitude, the complex modulus  which is defined as the square root of the product of  with its complex conjugate:\n \n\nIf  is a decomposition of  into its real and imaginary parts, then the modulus is the usual Euclidean two-dimensional length:\n\n \n\nThe inner product of a pair of complex numbers  and  is the product of  with the complex conjugate of :\n \n\nThis is complex-valued. The real part of  gives the usual two-dimensional Euclidean dot product.\n\nA second example is the space  whose elements are pairs of complex numbers . Then the inner product of  with another such vector  is given by\n\nThe real part of  is then the four-dimensional Euclidean dot product. This inner product is Hermitian symmetric, which means that the result of interchanging  and  is the complex conjugate:\n\nDefinition\nA Hilbert space  is a real or complex inner product space that is also a complete metric space with respect to the distance function induced by the inner product.The mathematical material in this section can be found in any good textbook on functional analysis, such as , ,  or .\n\nTo say that  is a complex inner product space means that  is a complex vector space on which there is an inner product  associating a complex number to each pair of elements  of  that satisfies the following properties:\n The inner product is conjugate symmetric; that is, the inner product of a pair of elements is equal to the complex conjugate of the inner product of the swapped elements:\n \n The inner product is linear in its firstIn some conventions, inner products are linear in their second arguments instead. argument. For all complex numbers  and ,\n \n The inner product of an element with itself is positive definite:\n \n\nIt follows from properties 1 and 2 that a complex inner product is conjugate linear in its second argument, meaning that\n\nA real inner product space is defined in the same way, except that  is a real vector space and the inner product takes real values. Such an inner product will be bilinear: that is, linear in each argument.\n\nThe norm is the real-valued function\n\nand the distance  between two points  in  is defined in terms of the norm by\n\nThat this function is a distance function means firstly that it is symmetric in  and , secondly that the distance between  and itself is zero, and otherwise the distance between  and  must be positive, and lastly that the triangle inequality holds, meaning that the length of one leg of a triangle  cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the other two legs:\n\n300px|none\n\nThis last property is ultimately a consequence of the more fundamental Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, which asserts\n\nwith equality if and only if  and  are linearly dependent.\n\nWith a distance function defined in this way, any inner product space is a metric space, and sometimes is known as a pre-Hilbert space. Any pre-Hilbert space that is additionally also a complete space is a Hilbert space.\n\nThe completeness of  is expressed using a form of the Cauchy criterion for sequences in : a pre-Hilbert space  is complete if every Cauchy sequence converges with respect to this norm to an element in the space. Completeness can be characterized by the following equivalent condition: if a series of vectors\n \n\nconverges absolutely in the sense that\n\nthen the series converges in , in the sense that the partial sums converge to an element of .\n\nAs a complete normed space, Hilbert spaces are by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well defined. Of special importance is the notion of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in a complete metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.\n\nSecond example: sequence spaces\nThe sequence space  consists of all infinite sequences  of complex numbers such that the series\n \n\nconverges. The inner product on  is defined by\n \n\nwith the latter series converging as a consequence of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality.\n\nCompleteness of the space holds provided that whenever a series of elements from  converges absolutely (in norm), then it converges to an element of . The proof is basic in mathematical analysis, and permits mathematical series of elements of the space to be manipulated with the same ease as series of complex numbers (or vectors in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space).\n\nHistory\nthumb|right|David Hilbert\nPrior to the development of Hilbert spaces, other generalizations of Euclidean spaces were known to mathematicians and physicists. In particular, the idea of an abstract linear space had gained some traction towards the end of the 19th century:Largely from the work of Hermann Grassmann, at the urging of August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius . The first modern axiomatic account of abstract vector spaces ultimately appeared in Giuseppe Peano's 1888 account (; ). this is a space whose elements can be added together and multiplied by scalars (such as real or complex numbers) without necessarily identifying these elements with \"geometric\" vectors, such as position and momentum vectors in physical systems. Other objects studied by mathematicians at the turn of the 20th century, in particular spaces of sequences (including series) and spaces of functions,A detailed account of the history of Hilbert spaces can be found in . can naturally be thought of as linear spaces. Functions, for instance, can be added together or multiplied by constant scalars, and these operations obey the algebraic laws satisfied by addition and scalar multiplication of spatial vectors.\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, parallel developments led to the introduction of Hilbert spaces. The first of these was the observation, which arose during David Hilbert and Erhard Schmidt's study of integral equations, that two square-integrable real-valued functions  and  on an interval  have an inner product\n\n \n\nwhich has many of the familiar properties of the Euclidean dot product. In particular, the idea of an orthogonal family of functions has meaning. Schmidt exploited the similarity of this inner product with the usual dot product to prove an analog of the spectral decomposition for an operator of the form\n\n \n\nwhere  is a continuous function symmetric in  and . The resulting eigenfunction expansion expresses the function  as a series of the form\n\n \n\nwhere the functions  are orthogonal in the sense that  for all . The individual terms in this series are sometimes referred to as elementary product solutions. However, there are eigenfunction expansions that fail to converge in a suitable sense to a square-integrable function: the missing ingredient, which ensures convergence, is completeness.\n\nThe second development was the Lebesgue integral, an alternative to the Riemann integral introduced by Henri Lebesgue in 1904.. Further details on the history of integration theory can be found in  and . The Lebesgue integral made it possible to integrate a much broader class of functions. In 1907, Frigyes Riesz and Ernst Sigismund Fischer independently proved that the space  of square Lebesgue-integrable functions is a complete metric space.. As a consequence of the interplay between geometry and completeness, the 19th century results of Joseph Fourier, Friedrich Bessel and Marc-Antoine Parseval on trigonometric series easily carried over to these more general spaces, resulting in a geometrical and analytical apparatus now usually known as the Riesz\u2013Fischer theorem.\n\nFurther basic results were proved in the early 20th century. For example, the Riesz representation theorem was independently established by Maurice Fr\u00e9chet and Frigyes Riesz in 1907.In , the result that every linear functional on  is represented by integration is jointly attributed to  and . The general result, that the dual of a Hilbert space is identified with the Hilbert space itself, can be found in . John von Neumann coined the term abstract Hilbert space in his work on unbounded Hermitian operators.. Although other mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener had already studied particular Hilbert spaces in great detail, often from a physically motivated point of view, von Neumann gave the first complete and axiomatic treatment of them. Von Neumann later used them in his seminal work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, and in his continued work with Eugene Wigner. The name \"Hilbert space\" was soon adopted by others, for example by Hermann Weyl in his book on quantum mechanics and the theory of groups..\n\nThe significance of the concept of a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics.. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are hermitian operators on that space, the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus for the development of the unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space (Koopman\u2013von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.\n\nThe algebra of observables in quantum mechanics is naturally an algebra of operators defined on a Hilbert space, according to Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory. Von Neumann began investigating operator algebras in the 1930s, as rings of operators on a Hilbert space. The kind of algebras studied by von Neumann and his contemporaries are now known as von Neumann algebras. In the 1940s, Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark and Irving Segal gave a definition of a kind of operator algebras called C*-algebras that on the one hand made no reference to an underlying Hilbert space, and on the other extrapolated many of the useful features of the operator algebras that had previously been studied. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators in particular that underlies much of the existing Hilbert space theory was generalized to C*-algebras. These techniques are now basic in abstract harmonic analysis and representation theory.\n\nExamples\n\nLebesgue spaces\n\nLebesgue spaces are function spaces associated to measure spaces , where  is a set,  is a \u03c3-algebra of subsets of , and  is a countably additive measure on . Let  be the space of those complex-valued measurable functions on  for which the Lebesgue integral of the square of the absolute value of the function is finite, i.e., for a function  in ,\n\n \n\nand where functions are identified if and only if they differ only on a set of measure zero.\n\nThe inner product of functions  and  in  is then defined as\n\nFor  and  in , this integral exists because of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, and defines an inner product on the space. Equipped with this inner product,  is in fact complete.. The Lebesgue integral is essential to ensure completeness: on domains of real numbers, for instance, not enough functions are Riemann integrable..\n\nThe Lebesgue spaces appear in many natural settings. The spaces  and  of square-integrable functions with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the real line and unit interval, respectively, are natural domains on which to define the Fourier transform and Fourier series. In other situations, the measure may be something other than the ordinary Lebesgue measure on the real line. For instance, if  is any positive measurable function, the space of all measurable functions  on the interval  satisfying\n \n\nis called the weighted  space , and  is called the weight function. The inner product is defined by\n\nThe weighted space  is identical with the Hilbert space  where the measure  of a Lebesgue-measurable set  is defined by\n\nWeighted  spaces like this are frequently used to study orthogonal polynomials, because different families of orthogonal polynomials are orthogonal with respect to different weighting functions.\n\nSobolev spaces\nSobolev spaces, denoted by  or , are Hilbert spaces. These are a special kind of function space in which differentiation may be performed, but that (unlike other Banach spaces such as the H\u00f6lder spaces) support the structure of an inner product. Because differentiation is permitted, Sobolev spaces are a convenient setting for the theory of partial differential equations. They also form the basis of the theory of direct methods in the calculus of variations..\n\nFor  a non-negative integer and , the Sobolev space  contains  functions whose weak derivatives of order up to  are also . The inner product in  is\n\n \n\nwhere the dot indicates the dot product in the Euclidean space of partial derivatives of each order. Sobolev spaces can also be defined when  is not an integer.\n\nSobolev spaces are also studied from the point of view of spectral theory, relying more specifically on the Hilbert space structure. If  is a suitable domain, then one can define the Sobolev space  as the space of Bessel potentials; roughly,\n \n\nHere  is the Laplacian and  is understood in terms of the spectral mapping theorem. Apart from providing a workable definition of Sobolev spaces for non-integer , this definition also has particularly desirable properties under the Fourier transform that make it ideal for the study of pseudodifferential operators. Using these methods on a compact Riemannian manifold, one can obtain for instance the Hodge decomposition, which is the basis of Hodge theory.Details can be found in .\n\nSpaces of holomorphic functions\nHardy spaces\nThe Hardy spaces are function spaces, arising in complex analysis and harmonic analysis, whose elements are certain holomorphic functions in a complex domain.A general reference on Hardy spaces is the book . Let  denote the unit disc in the complex plane. Then the Hardy space  is defined as the space of holomorphic functions  on  such that the means\n\n \n\nremain bounded for . The norm on this Hardy space is defined by\n\n \n\nHardy spaces in the disc are related to Fourier series. A function  is in  if and only if\n\n \n\nwhere\n\n \n\nThus  consists of those functions that are L2 on the circle, and whose negative frequency Fourier coefficients vanish.\n\nBergman spaces\nThe Bergman spaces are another family of Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions. Let  be a bounded open set in the complex plane (or a higher-dimensional complex space) and let  be the space of holomorphic functions  in  that are also in  in the sense that\n\nwhere the integral is taken with respect to the Lebesgue measure in . Clearly  is a subspace of ; in fact, it is a closed subspace, and so a Hilbert space in its own right. This is a consequence of the estimate, valid on compact subsets  of , that\n\nwhich in turn follows from Cauchy's integral formula. Thus convergence of a sequence of holomorphic functions in  implies also compact convergence, and so the limit function is also holomorphic. Another consequence of this inequality is that the linear functional that evaluates a function  at a point of  is actually continuous on . The Riesz representation theorem implies that the evaluation functional can be represented as an element of . Thus, for every , there is a function  such that\n \n\nfor all . The integrand\n \n\nis known as the Bergman kernel of . This integral kernel satisfies a reproducing property\n \n\nA Bergman space is an example of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which is a Hilbert space of functions along with a kernel  that verifies a reproducing property analogous to this one. The Hardy space  also admits a reproducing kernel, known as the Szeg\u0151 kernel. Reproducing kernels are common in other areas of mathematics as well. For instance, in harmonic analysis the Poisson kernel is a reproducing kernel for the Hilbert space of square-integrable harmonic functions in the unit ball. That the latter is a Hilbert space at all is a consequence of the mean value theorem for harmonic functions.\n\nApplications\nMany of the applications of Hilbert spaces exploit the fact that Hilbert spaces support generalizations of simple geometric concepts like projection and change of basis from their usual finite dimensional setting. In particular, the spectral theory of continuous self-adjoint linear operators on a Hilbert space generalizes the usual spectral decomposition of a matrix, and this often plays a major role in applications of the theory to other areas of mathematics and physics.\n\nSturm\u2013Liouville theory\n\nright|thumb|The overtones of a vibrating string. These are eigenfunctions of an associated Sturm\u2013Liouville problem. The eigenvalues 1, , , \u2026 form the (musical) harmonic series.\nIn the theory of ordinary differential equations, spectral methods on a suitable Hilbert space are used to study the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of differential equations. For example, the Sturm\u2013Liouville problem arises in the study of the harmonics of waves in a violin string or a drum, and is a central problem in ordinary differential equations.. The problem is a differential equation of the form\n \n\nfor an unknown function  on an interval , satisfying general homogeneous Robin boundary conditions\n \nThe functions , , and  are given in advance, and the problem is to find the function  and constants  for which the equation has a solution. The problem only has solutions for certain values of , called eigenvalues of the system, and this is a consequence of the spectral theorem for compact operators applied to the integral operator defined by the Green's function for the system. Furthermore, another consequence of this general result is that the eigenvalues  of the system can be arranged in an increasing sequence tending to infinity.The eigenvalues of the Fredholm kernel are , which tend to zero.\n\nPartial differential equations\nHilbert spaces form a basic tool in the study of partial differential equations.. For many classes of partial differential equations, such as linear elliptic equations, it is possible to consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or, often what is more important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic equations, one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax\u2013Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution of partial differential equations.More detail on finite element methods from this point of view can be found in .\n\nA typical example is the Poisson equation  with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a bounded domain  in . The weak formulation consists of finding a function  such that, for all continuously differentiable functions  in  vanishing on the boundary:\n \n\nThis can be recast in terms of the Hilbert space  consisting of functions  such that , along with its weak partial derivatives, are square integrable on , and vanish on the boundary. The question then reduces to finding  in this space such that for all  in this space\n \n\nwhere  is a continuous bilinear form, and  is a continuous linear functional, given respectively by\n\nSince the Poisson equation is elliptic, it follows from Poincar\u00e9's inequality that the bilinear form  is coercive. The Lax\u2013Milgram theorem then ensures the existence and uniqueness of solutions of this equation.\n\nHilbert spaces allow for many elliptic partial differential equations to be formulated in a similar way, and the Lax\u2013Milgram theorem is then a basic tool in their analysis. With suitable modifications, similar techniques can be applied to parabolic partial differential equations and certain hyperbolic partial differential equations.\n\nErgodic theory\nthumb|right|The path of a billiard ball in the Bunimovich stadium is described by an ergodic dynamical system.\nThe field of ergodic theory is the study of the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which\u2014though the microscopic state of a system is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)\u2014the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is tractable. The laws of thermodynamics are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.\n\nAn ergodic dynamical system is one for which, apart from the energy\u2014measured by the Hamiltonian\u2014there are no other functionally independent conserved quantities on the phase space. More explicitly, suppose that the energy  is fixed, and let  be the subset of the phase space consisting of all states of energy  (an energy surface), and let  denote the evolution operator on the phase space. The dynamical system is ergodic if there are no continuous non-constant functions on  such that\n \n\nfor all  on  and all time . Liouville's theorem implies that there exists a measure  on the energy surface that is invariant under the time translation. As a result, time translation is a unitary transformation of the Hilbert space  consisting of square-integrable functions on the energy surface  with respect to the inner product\n \n\nThe von Neumann mean ergodic theorem states the following:\n If  is a (strongly continuous) one-parameter semigroup of unitary operators on a Hilbert space , and  is the orthogonal projection onto the space of common fixed points of , , then\n \n\nFor an ergodic system, the fixed set of the time evolution consists only of the constant functions, so the ergodic theorem implies the following: for any function ,\n \n\nThat is, the long time average of an observable  is equal to its expectation value over an energy surface.\n\nFourier analysis\nthumb|right|Superposition of sinusoidal wave basis functions (bottom) to form a sawtooth wave (top)\nthumb|right|Spherical harmonics, an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the sphere, shown graphed along the radial direction\nOne of the basic goals of Fourier analysis is to decompose a function into a (possibly infinite) linear combination of given basis functions: the associated Fourier series. The classical Fourier series associated to a function  defined on the interval  is a series of the form\n \n\nwhere\n \n\nThe example of adding up the first few terms in a Fourier series for a sawtooth function is shown in the figure. The basis functions are sine waves with wavelengths  (for integer ) shorter than the wavelength  of the sawtooth itself (except for , the fundamental wave). All basis functions have nodes at the nodes of the sawtooth, but all but the fundamental have additional nodes. The oscillation of the summed terms about the sawtooth is called the Gibbs phenomenon.\n\nA significant problem in classical Fourier series asks in what sense the Fourier series converges, if at all, to the function . Hilbert space methods provide one possible answer to this question.A treatment of Fourier series from this point of view is available, for instance, in  or . The functions  form an orthogonal basis of the Hilbert space . Consequently, any square-integrable function can be expressed as a series\n\nand, moreover, this series converges in the Hilbert space sense (that is, in the  mean).\n\nThe problem can also be studied from the abstract point of view: every Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis, and every element of the Hilbert space can be written in a unique way as a sum of multiples of these basis elements. The coefficients appearing on these basis elements are sometimes known abstractly as the Fourier coefficients of the element of the space. The abstraction is especially useful when it is more natural to use different basis functions for a space such as . In many circumstances, it is desirable not to decompose a function into trigonometric functions, but rather into orthogonal polynomials or wavelets for instance, and in higher dimensions into spherical harmonics..\n\nFor instance, if  are any orthonormal basis functions of , then a given function in  can be approximated as a finite linear combination\n \n\nThe coefficients  are selected to make the magnitude of the difference  as small as possible. Geometrically, the best approximation is the orthogonal projection of  onto the subspace consisting of all linear combinations of the , and can be calculated by\n \n\nThat this formula minimizes the difference  is a consequence of Bessel's inequality and Parseval's formula.\n\nIn various applications to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms the foundation for the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator.The classic reference for spectral methods is . A more up-to-date account is . A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental modes of vibration that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, that represent the fundamental modes of vibration in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental modes of vibration of the violin string.\n\nSpectral theory also underlies certain aspects of the Fourier transform of a function. Whereas Fourier analysis decomposes a function defined on a compact set into the discrete spectrum of the Laplacian (which corresponds to the vibrations of a violin string or drum), the Fourier transform of a function is the decomposition of a function defined on all of Euclidean space into its components in the continuous spectrum of the Laplacian. The Fourier transformation is also geometrical, in a sense made precise by the Plancherel theorem, that asserts that it is an isometry of one Hilbert space (the \"time domain\") with another (the \"frequency domain\"). This isometry property of the Fourier transformation is a recurring theme in abstract harmonic analysis, as evidenced for instance by the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions occurring in noncommutative harmonic analysis.\n\nQuantum mechanics\nright|thumb|The orbitals of an electron in a hydrogen atom are eigenfunctions of the energy.\nIn the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system are represented by unit vectors (called state vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state space, well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate.\n\nThe inner product between two state vectors is a complex number known as a probability amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, the probability that a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator\u2014which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.\n\nFor a general system, states are typically not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace one on a Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, the effects of a single measurement can influence other parts of a system in a manner that is described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.\n\nColor perception\n\nAny true physical color can be represented by a combination of pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of any number of spectral colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors can be represented by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The many-to-one linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light, see metamerism).\n\nProperties\n\nPythagorean identity\nTwo vectors  and  in a Hilbert space  are orthogonal when . The notation for this is . More generally, when  is a subset in , the notation  means that  is orthogonal to every element from .\n\nWhen  and  are orthogonal, one has\n \n\nBy induction on , this is extended to any family  of  orthogonal vectors,\n\n \n\nWhereas the Pythagorean identity as stated is valid in any inner product space, completeness is required for the extension of the Pythagorean identity to series. A series  of orthogonal vectors converges in  if and only if the series of squares of norms converges, and\n \nFurthermore, the sum of a series of orthogonal vectors is independent of the order in which it is taken.\n\nParallelogram identity and polarization\nright|thumb|Geometrically, the parallelogram identity asserts that . In words, the sum of the squares of the diagonals is twice the sum of the squares of any two adjacent sides.\nBy definition, every Hilbert space is also a Banach space. Furthermore, in every Hilbert space the following parallelogram identity holds:\n \n\nConversely, every Banach space in which the parallelogram identity holds is a Hilbert space, and the inner product is uniquely determined by the norm by the polarization identity.. For real Hilbert spaces, the polarization identity is\n \n\nFor complex Hilbert spaces, it is\n \n\nThe parallelogram law implies that any Hilbert space is a uniformly convex Banach space..\n\nBest approximation\nThis subsection employs the Hilbert projection theorem. If  is a non-empty closed convex subset of a Hilbert space  and  a point in , there exists a unique point  that minimizes the distance between  and points in ,\n\n \n\nThis is equivalent to saying that there is a point with minimal norm in the translated convex set . The proof consists in showing that every minimizing sequence  is Cauchy (using the parallelogram identity) hence converges (using completeness) to a point in  that has minimal norm. More generally, this holds in any uniformly convex Banach space.\n\nWhen this result is applied to a closed subspace  of , it can be shown that the point  closest to  is characterized by\n\n \n\nThis point  is the orthogonal projection of  onto , and the mapping  is linear (see Orthogonal complements and projections). This result is especially significant in applied mathematics, especially numerical analysis, where it forms the basis of least squares methods.\n\nIn particular, when  is not equal to , one can find a nonzero vector  orthogonal to  (select  and ). A very useful criterion is obtained by applying this observation to the closed subspace  generated by a subset  of .\n A subset  of  spans a dense vector subspace if (and only if) the vector 0 is the sole vector  orthogonal to .\n\nDuality\nThe dual space  is the space of all continuous linear functions from the space  into the base field. It carries a natural norm, defined by\n \nThis norm satisfies the parallelogram law, and so the dual space is also an inner product space. The dual space is also complete, and so it is a Hilbert space in its own right.\n\nThe Riesz representation theorem affords a convenient description of the dual. To every element  of , there is a unique element  of , defined by\n \n\nThe mapping  is an antilinear mapping from  to . The Riesz representation theorem states that this mapping is an antilinear isomorphism. Thus to every element  of the dual  there exists one and only one  in  such that\n \n\nfor all . The inner product on the dual space  satisfies\n \n\nThe reversal of order on the right-hand side restores linearity in  from the antilinearity of . In the real case, the antilinear isomorphism from  to its dual is actually an isomorphism, and so real Hilbert spaces are naturally isomorphic to their own duals.\n\nThe representing vector  is obtained in the following way. When , the kernel  is a closed vector subspace of , not equal to , hence there exists a nonzero vector  orthogonal to . The vector  is a suitable scalar multiple  of . The requirement that  yields\n \n\nThis correspondence  is exploited by the bra\u2013ket notation popular in physics. It is common in physics to assume that the inner product, denoted by , is linear on the right,\n \n\nThe result  can be seen as the action of the linear functional  (the bra) on the vector  (the ket).\n\nThe Riesz representation theorem relies fundamentally not just on the presence of an inner product, but also on the completeness of the space. In fact, the theorem implies that the topological dual of any inner product space can be identified with its completion. An immediate consequence of the Riesz representation theorem is also that a Hilbert space  is reflexive, meaning that the natural map from  into its double dual space is an isomorphism.\n\nWeakly-convergent sequences\n\nIn a Hilbert space , a sequence  is weakly convergent to a vector  when\n\n \n\nfor every .\n\nFor example, any orthonormal sequence  converges weakly to\u00a00, as a consequence of Bessel's inequality. Every weakly convergent sequence  is bounded, by the uniform boundedness principle.\n\nConversely, every bounded sequence in a Hilbert space admits weakly convergent subsequences (Alaoglu's theorem). This fact may be used to prove minimization results for continuous convex functionals, in the same way that the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem is used for continuous functions on . Among several variants, one simple statement is as follows:\n\nIf  is a convex continuous function such that  tends to  when  tends to , then  admits a minimum at some point .\n\nThis fact (and its various generalizations) are fundamental for direct methods in the calculus of variations. Minimization results for convex functionals are also a direct consequence of the slightly more abstract fact that closed bounded convex subsets in a Hilbert space  are weakly compact, since  is reflexive. The existence of weakly convergent subsequences is a special case of the Eberlein\u2013\u0160mulian theorem.\n\nBanach space properties\nAny general property of Banach spaces continues to hold for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove in the case of Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).\n\nThe (geometrical) Hahn\u2013Banach theorem asserts that a closed convex set can be separated from any point outside it by means of a hyperplane of the Hilbert space. This is an immediate consequence of the best approximation property: if  is the element of a closed convex set  closest to , then the separating hyperplane is the plane perpendicular to the segment  passing through its midpoint.\n\nOperators on Hilbert spaces\n\nBounded operators\nThe continuous linear operators  from a Hilbert space  to a second Hilbert space  are bounded in the sense that they map bounded sets to bounded sets. Conversely, if an operator is bounded, then it is continuous. The space of such bounded linear operators has a norm, the operator norm given by\n\nThe sum and the composite of two bounded linear operators is again bounded and linear. For y in H2, the map that sends x\u00a0\u2208 H1 to \u27e8Ax, y\u27e9 is linear and continuous, and according to the Riesz representation theorem can therefore be represented in the form\n \n\nfor some vector  in . This defines another bounded linear operator , the adjoint of . One can see that .\n\nThe set  of all bounded linear operators on  (operators ), together with the addition and composition operations, the norm and the adjoint operation, is a C*-algebra, which is a type of operator algebra.\n\nAn element  of  is called 'self-adjoint' or 'Hermitian' if . If  is Hermitian and  for every , then  is called 'nonnegative', written ; if equality holds only when , then  is called 'positive'. The set of self adjoint operators admits a partial order, in which  if . If  has the form  for some , then  is nonnegative; if  is invertible, then  is positive. A converse is also true in the sense that, for a non-negative operator , there exists a unique non-negative square root  such that\n \n\nIn a sense made precise by the spectral theorem, self-adjoint operators can usefully be thought of as operators that are \"real\". An element  of  is called normal if . Normal operators decompose into the sum of a self-adjoint operators and an imaginary multiple of a self adjoint operator\n \n\nthat commute with each other. Normal operators can also usefully be thought of in terms of their real and imaginary parts.\n\nAn element  of  is called unitary if  is invertible and its inverse is given by . This can also be expressed by requiring that  be onto and  for all . The unitary operators form a group under composition, which is the isometry group of .\n\nAn element of  is compact if it sends bounded sets to relatively compact sets. Equivalently, a bounded operator  is compact if, for any bounded sequence , the sequence  has a convergent subsequence. Many integral operators are compact, and in fact define a special class of operators known as Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operators that are especially important in the study of integral equations. Fredholm operators differ from a compact operator by a multiple of the identity, and are equivalently characterized as operators with a finite dimensional kernel and cokernel. The index of a Fredholm operator  is defined by\n \n\nThe index is homotopy invariant, and plays a deep role in differential geometry via the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem.\n\nUnbounded operators\nUnbounded operators are also tractable in Hilbert spaces, and have important applications to quantum mechanics.See ,  and . An unbounded operator  on a Hilbert space  is defined as a linear operator whose domain  is a linear subspace of . Often the domain  is a dense subspace of , in which case  is known as a densely defined operator.\n\nThe adjoint of a densely defined unbounded operator is defined in essentially the same manner as for bounded operators. Self-adjoint unbounded operators play the role of the observables in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. Examples of self-adjoint unbounded operators on the Hilbert space  are:\n\nThese correspond to the momentum and position observables, respectively. Note that neither  nor  is defined on all of , since in the case of  the derivative need not exist, and in the case of  the product function need not be square integrable. In both cases, the set of possible arguments form dense subspaces of .\n\nConstructions\n\nDirect sums\nTwo Hilbert spaces  and  can be combined into another Hilbert space, called the (orthogonal) direct sum, and denoted\n \n\nconsisting of the set of all ordered pairs  where , , and inner product defined by\n \n\nMore generally, if  is a family of Hilbert spaces indexed by , then the direct sum of the , denoted\n \n\nconsists of the set of all indexed families\n \n\nin the Cartesian product of the  such that\n \n\nThe inner product is defined by\n \n\nEach of the  is included as a closed subspace in the direct sum of all of the . Moreover, the  are pairwise orthogonal. Conversely, if there is a system of closed subspaces, , , in a Hilbert space , that are pairwise orthogonal and whose union is dense in , then  is canonically isomorphic to the direct sum of . In this case,  is called the internal direct sum of the . A direct sum (internal or external) is also equipped with a family of orthogonal projections  onto the th direct summand . These projections are bounded, self-adjoint, idempotent operators that satisfy the orthogonality condition\n \n\nThe spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space  states that  splits into an orthogonal direct sum of the eigenspaces of an operator, and also gives an explicit decomposition of the operator as a sum of projections onto the eigenspaces. The direct sum of Hilbert spaces also appears in quantum mechanics as the Fock space of a system containing a variable number of particles, where each Hilbert space in the direct sum corresponds to an additional degree of freedom for the quantum mechanical system. In representation theory, the Peter\u2013Weyl theorem guarantees that any unitary representation of a compact group on a Hilbert space splits as the direct sum of finite-dimensional representations.\n\nTensor products\n\nIf  and , then one defines an inner product on the (ordinary) tensor product as follows. On simple tensors, let\n\n \n\nThis formula then extends by sesquilinearity to an inner product on . The Hilbertian tensor product of  and , sometimes denoted by , is the Hilbert space obtained by completing  for the metric associated to this inner product.\n\nAn example is provided by the Hilbert space . The Hilbertian tensor product of two copies of  is isometrically and linearly isomorphic to the space  of square-integrable functions on the square . This isomorphism sends a simple tensor  to the function\n\n \n\non the square.\n\nThis example is typical in the following sense. Associated to every simple tensor product  is the rank one operator from  to  that maps a given  as\n\n \n\nThis mapping defined on simple tensors extends to a linear identification between  and the space of finite rank operators from  to . This extends to a linear isometry of the Hilbertian tensor product  with the Hilbert space  of Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operators from  to .\n\nOrthonormal bases\nThe notion of an orthonormal basis from linear algebra generalizes over to the case of Hilbert spaces.. In a Hilbert space , an orthonormal basis is a family  of elements of  satisfying the conditions:\n Orthogonality: Every two different elements of  are orthogonal:  for all  with .\n Normalization: Every element of the family has norm 1:  for all .\n Completeness: The linear span of the family , , is dense in H.\n\nA system of vectors satisfying the first two conditions basis is called an orthonormal system or an orthonormal set (or an orthonormal sequence if  is countable). Such a system is always linearly independent. Completeness of an orthonormal system of vectors of a Hilbert space can be equivalently restated as:\n\n if  for all  and some  then .\n\nThis is related to the fact that the only vector orthogonal to a dense linear subspace is the zero vector, for if  is any orthonormal set and  is orthogonal to , then  is orthogonal to the closure of the linear span of , which is the whole space.\n\nExamples of orthonormal bases include:\n the set  forms an orthonormal basis of  with the dot product;\n the sequence  with  forms an orthonormal basis of the complex space ;\n\nIn the infinite-dimensional case, an orthonormal basis will not be a basis in the sense of linear algebra; to distinguish the two, the latter basis is also called a Hamel basis. That the span of the basis vectors is dense implies that every vector in the space can be written as the sum of an infinite series, and the orthogonality implies that this decomposition is unique.\n\nSequence spaces\nThe space  of square-summable sequences of complex numbers is the set of infinite sequences\n\n \n\nof complex numbers such that\n\n \n\nThis space has an orthonormal basis:\n\n \n\nMore generally, if  is any set, then one can form a Hilbert space of sequences with index set , defined by\n\n \n\nThe summation over B is here defined by\n\n \n\nthe supremum being taken over all finite subsets of\u00a0. It follows that, for this sum to be finite, every element of  has only countably many nonzero terms. This space becomes a Hilbert space with the inner product\n\nfor all . Here the sum also has only countably many nonzero terms, and is unconditionally convergent by the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality.\n\nAn orthonormal basis of  is indexed by the set , given by\n\nBessel's inequality and Parseval's formula\nLet  be a finite orthonormal system in\u00a0. For an arbitrary vector , let\n\n \n\nThen  for every . It follows that  is orthogonal to each , hence  is orthogonal to\u00a0. Using the Pythagorean identity twice, it follows that\n\n \n\nLet , be an arbitrary orthonormal system in\u00a0. Applying the preceding inequality to every finite subset  of  gives the Bessel inequalityFor the case of finite index sets, see, for instance, . For infinite index sets, see .\n\n \n\n(according to the definition of the sum of an arbitrary family of non-negative real numbers).\n\nGeometrically, Bessel's inequality implies that the orthogonal projection of  onto the linear subspace spanned by the  has norm that does not exceed that of . In two dimensions, this is the assertion that the length of the leg of a right triangle may not exceed the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nBessel's inequality is a stepping stone to the more powerful Parseval identity, which governs the case when Bessel's inequality is actually an equality. If  is an orthonormal basis of , then every element  of  may be written as\n\n \n\nEven if  is uncountable, Bessel's inequality guarantees that the expression is well-defined and consists only of countably many nonzero terms. This sum is called the Fourier expansion of , and the individual coefficients  are the Fourier coefficients of . Parseval's formula is then\n \n\nConversely, if  is an orthonormal set such that Parseval's identity holds for every , then  is an orthonormal basis.\n\nHilbert dimension\nAs a consequence of Zorn's lemma, every Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis; furthermore, any two orthonormal bases of the same space have the same cardinality, called the Hilbert dimension of the space.. Many authors, such as , refer to this just as the dimension. Unless the Hilbert space is finite dimensional, this is not the same thing as its dimension as a linear space (the cardinality of a Hamel basis). For instance, since  has an orthonormal basis indexed by , its Hilbert dimension is the cardinality of  (which may be a finite integer, or a countable or uncountable cardinal number).\n\nAs a consequence of Parseval's identity, if  is an orthonormal basis of , then the map  defined by  is an isometric isomorphism of Hilbert spaces: it is a bijective linear mapping such that\n\nfor all . The cardinal number of  is the Hilbert dimension of . Thus every Hilbert space is isometrically isomorphic to a sequence space  for some set .\n\nSeparable spaces\nA Hilbert space is separable if and only if it admits a countable orthonormal basis. All infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces are therefore isometrically isomorphic to .\n\nIn the past, Hilbert spaces were often required to be separable as part of the definition. Most spaces used in physics are separable, and since these are all isomorphic to each other, one often refers to any infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space as \"the Hilbert space\" or just \"Hilbert space\". defines a Hilbert space via a countable Hilbert basis, which amounts to an isometric isomorphism with l2. The convention still persists in most rigorous treatments of quantum mechanics; see for instance . Even in quantum field theory, most of the Hilbert spaces are in fact separable, as stipulated by the Wightman axioms. However, it is sometimes argued that non-separable Hilbert spaces are also important in quantum field theory, roughly because the systems in the theory possess an infinite number of degrees of freedom and any infinite Hilbert tensor product (of spaces of dimension greater than one) is non-separable. For instance, a bosonic field can be naturally thought of as an element of a tensor product whose factors represent harmonic oscillators at each point of space. From this perspective, the natural state space of a boson might seem to be a non-separable space. However, it is only a small separable subspace of the full tensor product that can contain physically meaningful fields (on which the observables can be defined). Another non-separable Hilbert space models the state of an infinite collection of particles in an unbounded region of space. An orthonormal basis of the space is indexed by the density of the particles, a continuous parameter, and since the set of possible densities is uncountable, the basis is not countable.\n\nOrthogonal complements and projections\nIf  is a subset of a Hilbert space , the set of vectors orthogonal to  is defined by\n \n\n is a closed subspace of  (can be proved easily using the linearity and continuity of the inner product) and so forms itself a Hilbert space. If  is a closed subspace of , then  is called the orthogonal complement of . In fact, every  can then be written uniquely as , with  and . Therefore,  is the internal Hilbert direct sum of  and .\n\nThe linear operator  that maps  to  is called the orthogonal projection onto . There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the set of all closed subspaces of  and the set of all bounded self-adjoint operators  such that . Specifically,\n\n Theorem. The orthogonal projection  is a self-adjoint linear operator on  of norm \u2264\u00a01 with the property . Moreover, any self-adjoint linear operator  such that  is of the form , where  is the range of . For every  in ,  is the unique element  of  that minimizes the distance .\n\nThis provides the geometrical interpretation of : it is the best approximation to x by elements of V.\n\nProjections  and  are called mutually orthogonal if . This is equivalent to  and  being orthogonal as subspaces of . The sum of the two projections  and  is a projection only if  and  are orthogonal to each other, and in that case . The composite  is generally not a projection; in fact, the composite is a projection if and only if the two projections commute, and in that case .\n\nBy restricting the codomain to the Hilbert space , the orthogonal projection  gives rise to a projection mapping ; it is the adjoint of the inclusion mapping\n\n \n\nmeaning that\n\n \n\nfor all  and .\n\nThe operator norm of the orthogonal projection  onto a nonzero closed subspace  is equal to 1:\n \n\nEvery closed subspace V of a Hilbert space is therefore the image of an operator  of norm one such that . The property of possessing appropriate projection operators characterizes Hilbert spaces:\n\n A Banach space of dimension higher than 2 is (isometrically) a Hilbert space if and only if, for every closed subspace , there is an operator  of norm one whose image is  such that .\n\nWhile this result characterizes the metric structure of a Hilbert space, the structure of a Hilbert space as a topological vector space can itself be characterized in terms of the presence of complementary subspaces:\n A Banach space  is topologically and linearly isomorphic to a Hilbert space if and only if, to every closed subspace , there is a closed subspace  such that  is equal to the internal direct sum .\n\nThe orthogonal complement satisfies some more elementary results. It is a monotone function in the sense that if , then  with equality holding if and only if  is contained in the closure of . This result is a special case of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem. The closure of a subspace can be completely characterized in terms of the orthogonal complement: if  is a subspace of , then the closure of  is equal to . The orthogonal complement is thus a Galois connection on the partial order of subspaces of a Hilbert space. In general, the orthogonal complement of a sum of subspaces is the intersection of the orthogonal complements:\n \n\nIf the  are in addition closed, then\n \n\nSpectral theory\nThere is a well-developed spectral theory for self-adjoint operators in a Hilbert space, that is roughly analogous to the study of symmetric matrices over the reals or self-adjoint matrices over the complex numbers.A general account of spectral theory in Hilbert spaces can be found in . A more sophisticated account in the language of C*-algebras is in  or  In the same sense, one can obtain a \"diagonalization\" of a self-adjoint operator as a suitable sum (actually an integral) of orthogonal projection operators.\n\nThe spectrum of an operator , denoted , is the set of complex numbers  such that  lacks a continuous inverse. If  is bounded, then the spectrum is always a compact set in the complex plane, and lies inside the disc . If  is self-adjoint, then the spectrum is real. In fact, it is contained in the interval  where\n \n\nMoreover,  and  are both actually contained within the spectrum.\n\nThe eigenspaces of an operator  are given by\n \n\nUnlike with finite matrices, not every element of the spectrum of  must be an eigenvalue: the linear operator  may only lack an inverse because it is not surjective. Elements of the spectrum of an operator in the general sense are known as spectral values. Since spectral values need not be eigenvalues, the spectral decomposition is often more subtle than in finite dimensions.\n\nHowever, the spectral theorem of a self-adjoint operator  takes a particularly simple form if, in addition,  is assumed to be a compact operator. The spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators states:See, for instance,  or . This result was already known to  in the case of operators arising from integral kernels.\n A compact self-adjoint operator  has only countably (or finitely) many spectral values. The spectrum of  has no limit point in the complex plane except possibly zero. The eigenspaces of  decompose  into an orthogonal direct sum:\n \n Moreover, if  denotes the orthogonal projection onto the eigenspace , then\n \n where the sum converges with respect to the norm on .\n\nThis theorem plays a fundamental role in the theory of integral equations, as many integral operators are compact, in particular those that arise from Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operators.\n\nThe general spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators involves a kind of operator-valued Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral, rather than an infinite summation. The spectral family associated to  associates to each real number \u03bb an operator , which is the projection onto the nullspace of the operator , where the positive part of a self-adjoint operator is defined by\n \n\nThe operators  are monotone increasing relative to the partial order defined on self-adjoint operators; the eigenvalues correspond precisely to the jump discontinuities. One has the spectral theorem, which asserts\n \n\nThe integral is understood as a Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral, convergent with respect to the norm on . In particular, one has the ordinary scalar-valued integral representation\n \n\nA somewhat similar spectral decomposition holds for normal operators, although because the spectrum may now contain non-real complex numbers, the operator-valued Stieltjes measure  must instead be replaced by a resolution of the identity.\n\nA major application of spectral methods is the spectral mapping theorem, which allows one to apply to a self-adjoint operator  any continuous complex function  defined on the spectrum of  by forming the integral\n \n\nThe resulting continuous functional calculus has applications in particular to pseudodifferential operators.\n\nThe spectral theory of unbounded self-adjoint operators is only marginally more difficult than for bounded operators. The spectrum of an unbounded operator is defined in precisely the same way as for bounded operators:  is a spectral value if the resolvent operator\n \n\nfails to be a well-defined continuous operator. The self-adjointness of  still guarantees that the spectrum is real. Thus the essential idea of working with unbounded operators is to look instead at the resolvent  where  is nonreal. This is a bounded normal operator, which admits a spectral representation that can then be transferred to a spectral representation of  itself. A similar strategy is used, for instance, to study the spectrum of the Laplace operator: rather than address the operator directly, one instead looks as an associated resolvent such as a Riesz potential or Bessel potential.\n\nA precise version of the spectral theorem in this case is:.\n Given a densely defined self-adjoint operator  on a Hilbert space , there corresponds a unique resolution of the identity  on the Borel sets of , such that\n \n for all  and . The spectral measure  is concentrated on the spectrum of .\nThere is also a version of the spectral theorem that applies to unbounded normal operators.\n\n In popular culture \nThomas Pynchon introduced the fictional character, Sammy Hilbert-Spaess (a pun on \"Hilbert Space\"), in his 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow.  Hilbert-Spaess is first described as a \"a ubiquitous double agent\" and later as \"at least a double agent\".  The novel had earlier referenced the work of fellow German mathematician Kurt G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems which showed that Hilbert's Program, Hilbert's formalized plan to unify mathematics into a single set of axioms, was not possible.\n\nSee also\n\n Hadamard space\n Hilbert algebra\n Hilbert C*-module\n Hilbert manifold\n Operator theory\n Operator topologies\n Rigged Hilbert space\n\nRemarks\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n.\n .\n .\n .\n.\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n\n.\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n \n .\n .\n .\n .\n.\n\n.\n.\n .\n .\n .\n.\n.\n.\n .\n .\n .\n .\n.\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n.\n ; originally published Monografje Matematyczne, vol. 7, Warszawa, 1937.\n .\n.\n.\n .\n.\n.\n .\n .\n .\n.\n.\n.\n .\n .\n\nExternal links\n\n \n Hilbert space at Mathworld\n 245B, notes 5: Hilbert spaces by Terence Tao\n\n*\nCategory:Linear algebra\nCategory:Operator theory\nCategory:Quantum mechanics\nCategory:Functional analysis\nCategory:David Hilbert"}

More generally, the condition can be formulated for functions between any two metric spaces. The number \u03b1 is called the exponent of the H\u00f6lder condition.  A function on an interval satisfying the condition with \u03b1 > 1 is constant. If \u03b1 = 1, then the function satisfies a Lipschitz condition. For any \u03b1 > 0, the condition implies the function is uniformly continuous. The condition is named after Otto H\u00f6lder.\n\nWe have the following chain of strict inclusions for functions over a closed and bounded non-trivial interval of the real line\n\n Continuously differentiable \u2282 Lipschitz continuous \u2282 \u03b1-H\u00f6lder continuous \u2282  uniformly continuous  = continuous\n\nwhere 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1.\n\nH\u00f6lder spaces\nH\u00f6lder spaces consisting of functions satisfying a H\u00f6lder condition are basic in areas of functional analysis relevant to solving partial differential equations, and in dynamical systems. The H\u00f6lder space Ck,\u03b1(\u03a9), where \u03a9 is an open subset of some Euclidean space and k \u2265 0 an integer, consists of those functions on \u03a9 having continuous derivatives up to order k and such that the kth partial derivatives are H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent \u03b1, where 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1. This is a locally convex topological vector space. If the H\u00f6lder coefficient\n\nis finite, then the function f is said to be (uniformly) H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent \u03b1 in \u03a9. In this case, the H\u00f6lder coefficient serves as a seminorm. If the H\u00f6lder coefficient is merely bounded on compact subsets of \u03a9, then the function f is said to be locally H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent \u03b1 in \u03a9.\n\nIf the function f and its derivatives up to order k are bounded on the closure of \u03a9, then the H\u00f6lder space  can be assigned the norm\n\nwhere \u03b2 ranges over multi-indices and\n\nThese seminorms and norms are often denoted simply  and  or also  and  in order to stress the dependence on the domain of f.  If \u03a9 is open and bounded, then  is a Banach space with respect to the norm .\n\nCompact embedding of H\u00f6lder spaces\nLet \u03a9 be a bounded subset of some Euclidean space (or more generally, any totally bounded metric space) and let 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b2 \u2264 1 two H\u00f6lder exponents. Then, there is an obvious inclusion map of the corresponding H\u00f6lder spaces:\n\nwhich is continuous since, by definition of the H\u00f6lder norms, we have:\n\nMoreover, this inclusion is compact, meaning that bounded sets in the \u2016 \u00b7 \u20160,\u03b2 norm are relatively compact in the \u2016 \u00b7 \u20160,\u03b1 norm. This is a direct consequence of the Ascoli-Arzel\u00e0 theorem. Indeed, let (un) be a bounded sequence in C0,\u03b2(\u03a9). Thanks to the Ascoli-Arzel\u00e0 theorem we can assume without loss of generality that un \u2192 u uniformly, and we can also assume u = 0. Then\n\nbecause\n\nExamples\n If 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1 then all  H\u00f6lder continuous functions on a bounded set \u03a9 are also  H\u00f6lder continuous. This also includes \u03b2 = 1 and therefore all Lipschitz continuous functions on a bounded set are also C0,\u03b1 H\u00f6lder continuous.\n\n The function f(x) = x\u03b2 (with \u03b2 \u2264 1) defined on [0, 1] serves as a prototypical example of a function that is C0,\u03b1 H\u00f6lder continuous for 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2, but not for \u03b1 > \u03b2. Further, if we defined f analogously on , it would be C0,\u03b1 H\u00f6lder continuous only for \u03b1 = \u03b2.\n\n For \u03b1 > 1, any \u03b1\u2013H\u00f6lder continuous function on [0, 1] (or any interval) is a constant.\n\n There are examples of uniformly continuous functions that are not \u03b1\u2013H\u00f6lder continuous for any \u03b1. For instance, the function defined on [0, 1/2] by f(0) = 0 and by f(x) = 1/log(x) otherwise is continuous, and therefore uniformly continuous by the Heine-Cantor theorem.  It does not satisfy a H\u00f6lder condition of any order, however.\n\nThe Weierstrass function defined by:\n \nwhere  is an integer,  and  is \u03b1-H\u00f6lder continuous with \nHardy, G.

This result was originally due to Sergio Campanato.\n\nFunctions whose oscillation decay at a fixed rate with respect to distance are H\u00f6lder continuous with an exponent that is determined by the rate of decay. For instance, if\n\nfor some function u(x) satisfies\n\nfor a fixed \u03bb with 0 < \u03bb < 1 and all sufficiently small values of r, then u is H\u00f6lder continuous.\n\nFunctions in Sobolev space can be embedded into the appropriate H\u00f6lder space via Morrey's inequality if the spatial dimension is less than the exponent of the Sobolev space.

Under Rosenberger, who became the Academy\u2019s director in 1892, the group began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volap\u00fck, changing its nature into an entirely different language. The vocabulary was almost completely replaced by words more closely resembling those used in Western European languages, and a number of grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were discarded. It was understood that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named \u201cIdiom Neutral\u201d (which means \u201cthe neutral idiom\u201d or \u201cthe neutral language\u201d).\n\nThe name of the Academy was changed to Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year. Those who continued to use Volap\u00fck re-formed the International Academy of Volap\u00fck, retaining its name (with a spelling change) as Kad\u00e4m Bev\u00fcnetik Volap\u00fcka.\n\nDictionaries of Idiom Neutral including an outline of the grammar were published in several European languages in 1902 and 1903.\n\nThe language, sometimes referred to as \u201cNeutral\u201d or \u201cthe Neutral language\u201d by English-speaking writers, created interest among international language enthusiasts at the time. Rosenberger published a periodical in the language called Progres. In 1907 Neutral was one of the projects considered by a committee of scholars which met in Paris to select an international auxiliary language (what the committee actually decided upon is disputed; see Ido and its external links for more information).\n\nIn 1908 the Akademi which had created Idiom Neutral effectively chose to abandon it in favor of Latino sine flexione, a simplified form of Latin developed by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. Peano was appointed the director of the Akademi, and its name was changed to Academia pro Interlingua. Peano's language was sometimes called Interlingua, not to be confused with the better-known Interlingua presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).\n \nIn 1912 Rosenberger published a reformed version of Neutral called Reform-Neutral  Handbook of Reform-Neutral (1912) at archive.org.\n\n Grammar \n\nThe following is a rough sketch of Idiom Neutral grammar. It does not lay out every detail of grammar worked out for the language. The simple grammar of Idiom Neutral is similar to Interlingua's.\n\n Writing and pronunciation \n+ Idiom neutral alphabet (+ 1 digraph) Number 12345688910111213141516171819202122- Upper case  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSTUVYSH Lower case abcdefghijklmnoprstuvysh IPA phonemes\n\nTwenty-two letters of the Latin script are used to write Neutral; the letters q, w, x, and z do not occur. The five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are pronounced roughly as in Spanish. Vowels which appear next to each other are pronounced separately, not as a diphthong. The consonants have the same values as in English, except that c is pronounced like English ch in church, g is always like the g in gate, and j is pronounced as the s in measure. The combination sh is pronounced like English sh.\n\nThe stress falls on the vowel that precedes the last consonant. If no vowel precedes the last consonant (e.g. via way) the stress is on the first vowel. In a few cases the vowel at the end of a word is stressed; these vowels are marked with an acute accent (e.g. id\u00e9 idea). Such accents are the only diacritics used in writing Neutral words.\n\nNouns and adjectives\n\nUnlike Esperanto and Ido, nouns can end in any letter. There is no inflection for case. The plural is formed by adding the letter i at the end of the word.\n\nAdjectives can also end in any letter. They normally appear after the nouns they modify and do not agree in number with their nouns, e.g. kaset grand big box, kaseti grand big boxes.\n\nComparison of adjectives (and adverbs) is with plu ... ka (more ... than), tale ... kuale (as ... as) and leplu (most, -est).\n\nVerbs\n\nVerbs are conjugated as follows. Examples are shown for the verb amar to love in the active voice; the endings do not change for person or number, except in the imperative.\n\nInfinitive: amar to love\nPresent: mi am I love\nImperfect: mi amav I loved, I was loving\nFuture: mi amero I shall love\nPresent perfect: mi av amed I have loved\nPluperfect: mi avav amed I had loved\nFuture perfect: mi avero amed I shall have loved\nConditional: mi amerio I would love\nPast conditional: mi averio amed I would have loved\nImperative second person singular: ama! Love!\nImperative second person plural: amate! Love!\nImperative first person plural: amam! Let's love!\nActive participle: amant loving\nPassive participle: amed loved\n\nThe passive voice is formed with the verb esar to be and the passive participle: mi es amed I am loved, mi averio esed amed I would have been loved, etc.\n\nThere is no inflection for a subjunctive or volitive. In expressions of desire etc., the present tense is used e.g. mi volu ke il am I want him to love; ila demandav ke vo lekt it she asked you to read it.\n\nOther parts of speech\n\nThere is no definite or indefinite article. Adverbs can be formed from adjectives by adding e. Some prepositions are formed from other words by adding u e.g. relativu relative to from relativ relative (adj.).\n\n Sample texts \n\n\"Aparati deb esar adresed a shef de stasion Peterburg e deb esar asekured per vo e per votr kont; if aparati u partii de ili esero ruined u perded in voyaj, vo deb mitar nemediate otri, plasu aparati e partii ruined u perded.\"\n\nThe apparatus must be addressed to the chief of the St. Petersburg station and must be insured by you and by your account; if the apparatus or parts of them are ruined or lost in the voyage, you must send others immediately in place of the apparatus and parts ruined or lost.\n\n\"Publikasion de idiom neutral interesero votr filio, kel kolekt postmarki, kause ist idiom es lingu praktikal pro korespondad ko kolektatori in otr landi.\"\n\nThe publication of Idiom Neutral will interest your son, who collects postage stamps, because this idiom is a practical language for correspondence with collectors in other countries.\n\n References \n\n External links \n Holmes, M.

{"title": "Interpretation (logic)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_%28logic%29", "text": "An interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal language. Many formal languages used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics.\n\nThe most commonly studied formal logics are propositional logic, predicate logic and their modal analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a function that provides the extension of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate T (for \"tall\") and assign it the extension {a} (for \"Abraham Lincoln\"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant T, and does not make a claim about whether T is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'.  Though we may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.\n\nAn interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the truth values of sentences in a language. If a given interpretation assigns the value True to a sentence or theory, the interpretation is called a model of that sentence or theory.\n\n Formal languages \n\nA formal language consists of a possibly infinite set of sentences (variously  called words or formulas) built from a fixed set of letters or symbols. The inventory from which these letters are taken is called the alphabet over which the language is defined. To distinguish the strings of symbols that are in a formal language from arbitrary strings of symbols, the former are sometimes called well-formed formul\u00e6 (wff). The essential feature of a formal language is that its syntax can be defined without reference to interpretation. For example, we can determine that (P or Q) is a well-formed formula even without knowing whether it is true or false.\n\n Example \nA formal language  can be defined with the\nalphabet , and with a word being in  if it begins with  and is composed solely of the symbols  and .\n\nA possible interpretation of  could assign the decimal digit '1' to  and '0' to . Then  would denote 101 under this interpretation of .\n\n Logical constants \nIn the specific cases of propositional logic and predicate logic, the formal languages considered have alphabets that are divided into two sets: the logical symbols (logical constants) and the non-logical symbols.  The idea behind this terminology is that logical symbols have the same meaning regardless of the subject matter being studied, while non-logical symbols change in meaning depending on the area of investigation.\n\nLogical constants are always given the same meaning by every interpretation of the standard kind, so that only the meanings of the non-logical symbols are changed. Logical constants include quantifier symbols \u2200 (\"all\") and \u2203 (\"some\"), symbols for logical connectives \u2227 (\"and\"), \u2228 (\"or\"), \u00ac (\"not\"), parentheses and other grouping symbols, and (in many treatments) the equality symbol =.\n\n General properties of truth-functional interpretations \nMany of the commonly studied interpretations associate each sentence in a formal language with a single truth value, either True or False. These interpretations are called truth functional; they include the usual interpretations of propositional and first-order logic. The sentences that are made true by a particular assignment are said to be satisfied by that assignment.\n\nNo sentence can be made both true and false by the same interpretation, but it is possible that the truth value of the same sentence can be different under different interpretations.  A sentence is consistent if it is true under at least one interpretation; otherwise it is inconsistent. A sentence \u03c6 is said to be logically valid if it is satisfied by every interpretation (if \u03c6 is satisfied by every interpretation that satisfies \u03c8 then \u03c6 is said to be a logical consequence of \u03c8).\n\n Logical connectives \nSome of the logical symbols of a language (other than quantifiers) are truth-functional connectives that represent truth functions\u00a0\u2014 functions that take truth values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).\n\nThe truth-functional connectives enable compound sentences to be built up from simpler sentences. In this way, the truth value of the compound sentence is defined as a certain truth function of the truth values of the simpler sentences. The connectives are usually taken to be logical constants, meaning that the meaning of the connectives is always the same, independent of what interpretations are given to the other symbols in a formula.\n\nThis is how we define logical connectives in propositional logic:\n\u00ac\u03a6 is True iff \u03a6 is False.\n(\u03a6 \u2227 \u03a8) is True iff \u03a6 is True and \u03a8 is True.\n(\u03a6 \u2228 \u03a8) is True iff \u03a6 is True or \u03a8 is True (or both are True).\n(\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8) is True iff \u00ac\u03a6 is True or \u03a8 is True (or both are True).\n(\u03a6 \u2194 \u03a8) is True iff (\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8) is True and (\u03a8 \u2192 \u03a6) is True.\n\nSo under a given interpretation of all the sentence letters \u03a6 and \u03a8 (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The following table shows how this kind of thing looks. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. The other columns show the truth-values of formulas built from these sentence letters, with truth-values determined recursively.\n\n+ Logical connectives  Interpretation  \u03a6  \u03a8  \u00ac\u03a6  (\u03a6 \u2227 \u03a8)  (\u03a6 \u2228 \u03a8)  (\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8)  (\u03a6 \u2194 \u03a8)#1 T  T  F  T  T  T  T#2 T  F  F  F  T  F  F#3 F  T  T  F  T  T  F#4 F  F  T  F  F  T  T\n\nNow it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Take the formula F: (\u03a6 \u2228 \u00ac\u03a6). If our interpretation function makes \u03a6 True, then \u00ac\u03a6 is made False by the negation connective. Since the disjunct \u03a6 of F is True under that interpretation, F is True. Now the only other possible interpretation of \u03a6 makes it False, and if so, \u00ac\u03a6 is made True by the negation function. That would make F True again, since one of Fs disjuncts, \u00ac\u03a6, would be true under this interpretation. Since these two interpretations for F are the only possible logical interpretations, and since F comes out True for both, we say that it is logically valid or tautologous.\n\n Interpretation of a theory \n\nAn interpretation of a theory is the relationship between a theory and some subject matter when there is a many-to-one correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a correspondent it is called a full interpretation, otherwise it is called a partial interpretation. Here: p.48\n\n Interpretations for propositional logic \nThe formal language for propositional logic consists of formulas built up from propositional symbols (also called sentential symbols, sentential variables, and propositional variables) and logical connectives.  The only non-logical symbols in a formal language for propositional logic are the propositional symbols, which are often denoted by capital letters. To make the formal language precise, a specific set of propositional symbols must be fixed.\n\nThe standard kind of interpretation in this setting is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the truth values true and false. This function is known as a truth assignment or valuation function. In many presentations, it is literally a truth value that is assigned, but some presentations assign truthbearers instead.\n\nFor a language with n distinct propositional variables there are 2n distinct possible interpretations. For any particular variable a, for example, there are 21=2 possible interpretations: 1) a is assigned T, or 2) a is assigned F. For the pair a, b there are 22=4 possible interpretations: 1) both are assigned T, 2) both are assigned F, 3) a is assigned T and b is assigned F, or 4) a is assigned F and b is assigned T.\n\nGiven any truth assignment for a set of propositional symbols, there is a unique extension to an interpretation for all the propositional formulas built up from those variables. This extended interpretation is defined inductively, using the truth-table definitions of the logical connectives discussed above.\n\n First-order logic \nUnlike propositional logic, where every language is the same apart from a choice of a different set of propositional variables, there are many different first-order languages. Each first-order language is defined by a signature.  The signature consists of a set of non-logical symbols and an identification of each of these symbols as a constant symbol, a function symbol, or a predicate symbol.  In the case of function and predicate symbols, a natural number arity is also assigned. The alphabet for the formal language consists of logical constants, the equality relation symbol =, all the symbols from the signature, and an additional infinite set of symbols known as variables.\n\nFor example, in the language of rings, there are constant symbols 0 and 1, two binary function symbols + and \u00b7, and no binary relation symbols. (Here the equality relation is taken as a logical constant.)\n\nAgain, we might define a first-order language L, as consisting of individual symbols a, b, and c; predicate symbols F, G, H, I and J; variables x, y, z; no function letters; no sentential symbols.\n\n Formal languages for first-order logic \nGiven a signature \u03c3, the corresponding formal language is known as the set of \u03c3-formulas. Each \u03c3-formula is built up out of atomic formulas by means of logical connectives; atomic formulas are built from terms using predicate symbols.  The formal definition of the set of \u03c3-formulas proceeds in the other direction: first, terms are assembled from the constant and function symbols together with the variables. Then, terms can be combined into an atomic formula using a predicate symbol (relation symbol) from the signature or the special predicate symbol \"=\" for equality (see the section \"Interpreting equality\" below). Finally, the formulas of the language are assembled from atomic formulas using the logical connectives and quantifiers.\n\n Interpretations of a first-order language \nTo ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.\n A domain of discourseSometimes called the \"universe of disourse\" D, usually required to be non-empty (see below).\n For every constant symbol, an element of D as its interpretation.\n For every n-ary function symbol, an n-ary function from D to D as its interpretation (that is, a function Dn\u00a0\u2192\u00a0D).\n For every n-ary predicate symbol, an n-ary relation on D as its interpretation (that is, a subset of Dn).\nAn object carrying this information is known as a structure ( signature \u03c3), or \u03c3-structure, or L-structure (of language L), or as a \"model\".\n\nThe information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its free variables, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the T-schema, which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example,  is satisfied if and only if both \u03c6 and \u03c8 are satisfied.\n\nThis leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form  and . The domain of discourse forms the range for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence  is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of \u03c6(x), where x is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula  is satisfied if there is at least one element d of the domain such that \u03c6(d) is satisfied.\n\nStrictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula \u03c6(d) mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of \u03c6, because d is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.\n\nSome authors also admit propositional variables in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values true and false.\n\nBecause the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a propertyThe extension of a property (also called an attribute) is a set of individuals, so a property is a unary relation. E.g. The properties \"yellow\" and \"prime\" are unary relations.(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are extensionalsee also Extension (predicate logic) not intensional.\n\n Example of a first-order interpretation \nAn example of interpretation  of the language L described above is as follows.\n Domain: A chess set\n Individual constants: a: The white King b: The black Queen c: The white King's pawn\n F(x): x is a piece\n G(x): x is a pawn\n H(x): x is black\n I(x): x is white\n J(x, y): x can capture y\n\nIn the interpretation  of L:\n the following are true sentences: F(a), G(c), H(b), I(a) J(b, c),\n the following are false sentences: J(a, c), G(a).\n\n Non-empty domain requirement  \nAs stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as\n,\nwhere x is not a free variable of \u03c6, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence\n\nfails in any structure with an empty domain.  Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.\n\nEmpty relations do not cause any problem for first-order interpretations, because there is no similar notion of passing a relation symbol across a logical connective, enlarging its scope in the process. Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol.\n\n Interpreting equality \nThe equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches.\n\nThe first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if a = b and R(a) holds then R(b) holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for set theory or the signature for second-order arithmetic in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers.\n\nThe second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a normal model, so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called first order logic with equality, but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.\n\nThere are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an equivalence relation and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an elementarily equivalent interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered.\n\n Many-sorted first-order logic \nA generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one sort of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort.\n\nOne example of many-sorted logic is for planar Euclidean geometry. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation E which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the Euclidean plane, the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation E(p,l) holds if and only if point p is on line l.\n\n Higher-order predicate logics \nA formal language for higher-order predicate logic looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc.  All of these types of variables can be quantified.\n\nThere are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. Full semantics require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. Henkin semantics, which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain D, a collection of subsets of D, a collection of functions from D to D, etc.  The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic.\n\n Non-classical interpretations \nThe interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of non-classical logic (such as intuitionistic logic), and in the study of modal logic.\n\nInterpretations used to study non-classical logic include topological models, Boolean-valued models, and Kripke models.  Modal logic is also studied using Kripke models.\n\n Intended interpretations \nMany formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, \u2208, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended to be the set of natural numbers.\n\nThe intended interpretation is called the standard model (a term introduced by Abraham Robinson in 1960). In the context of Peano arithmetic, it consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are isomorphic to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the Peano axioms. There are also non-standard models of the (first-order version of the) Peano axioms, which contain elements not correlated with any natural number.\n\nWhile the intended interpretation can have no explicit indication in the strictly formal syntactical rules, it naturally affects the choice of the formation and transformation rules of the syntactical system. For example, primitive signs must permit expression of the concepts to be modeled; sentential formulas are chosen so that their counterparts in the intended interpretation are meaningful declarative sentences; primitive sentences need to come out as true sentences in the interpretation; rules of inference must be such that, if the sentence  is directly derivable from a sentence , then  turns out to be a true sentence, with  meaning implication, as usual. These requirements ensure that all provable sentences also come out to be true.\n\nMost formal systems have many more models than they were intended to have (the existence of non-standard models is an example). When we speak about 'models' in empirical sciences, we mean, if we want reality to be a model of our science, to speak about an intended model. A model in the empirical sciences is an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation (or in other contexts: a non-intended arbitrary interpretation used to clarify such an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation.) All models are interpretations that have the same domain of discourse as the intended one, but other assignments for non-logical constants.\n\n Example \n\nGiven a simple formal system (we shall call this one ) whose alphabet \u03b1 consists only of three symbols  and whose formation rule for formulas is:\n 'Any string of symbols of  which is at least 6 symbols long, and which is not infinitely long, is a formula of . Nothing else is a formula of .'\n\nThe single axiom schema of  is:\n\n \"  \" (where \"  \" is a metasyntactic variable standing for a finite string of \"  \"s )\n\nA formal proof can be constructed as follows:\n \n \n \n\nIn this example the theorem produced \"  \" can be interpreted as meaning \"One plus three equals four.\" A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as \"Four minus three equals one.\"\n\n Other concepts of interpretation \nThere are other uses of the term \"interpretation\" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages.\n\nIn model theory, a structure A is said to interpret a structure B if there is a definable subset D of A, and definable relations and functions on D, such that B is isomorphic to the structure with domain D and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain D that is used, but rather D modulo an equivalence relation definable in A.  For additional information, see Interpretation (model theory).\n\nA theory T is said to interpret another theory S if there is a finite extension by definitions T\u2032 of T such that S is contained in T\u2032.\n\n See also \nFree variables and Name binding\nHerbrand interpretation\nInterpretation (model theory)\nLogical system\nL\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem\nModal logic\nConceptual model\nModel theory\nSatisfiable\nTruth\n\n References \n\n External links \nStanford Enc.

{"title": "Jean van Heijenoort", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_van_Heijenoort", "text": "Jean Louis Maxime van Heijenoort (; ; July 23, 1912 \u2013 March 29, 1986) was a historian of mathematical logic. He was also a personal secretary to Leon Trotsky from 1932 to 1939, and from then until 1947, an American Trotskyist activist.\n\nLife\nVan Heijenoort was born in Creil, France. His family's financial circumstances were difficult as his Dutch immigrant father died when van Heijenoort was two. He nevertheless acquired a powerful traditional French formal education, to which his French writings attest. (He also published in Spanish.) Although he eventually became a naturalized American citizen, he visited France twice a year from 1958 until his death, and remained very attached to his French extended family and friends.\n\nPolitical views\nIn 1932, he joined the Trotskyist movement (recruited by Yvan Craipeau) and the Communist League. Very soon thereafter, the recently exiled Trotsky hired van Heijenoort as a secretary and bodyguard, primarily because of his fluency in French, Russian, German, and English. Thus began seven years in Trotsky's household, during which he served as an all-purpose translator, helping Trotsky write several books and keep up an extensive intellectual and political correspondence in several languages.\n\nIn 1939, van Heijenoort moved to New York City to be with his second wife, Beatrice \"Bunny\" Guyer, where he worked for the Socialist Workers Party (US) (SWP) and wrote a number of articles for the American Trotskyist press and other radical outlets. He was elected to the secretariat of the Fourth International in 1940 but resigned when Felix Morrow and Albert Goldman, with whom he had sided, were expelled from the SWP. Goldman subsequently went on to join the US Workers Party but Morrow joined no other party/grouping. In 1947, he too was expelled from the SWP. In 1948, he published an article, called \"A Century's Balance Sheet\" in which he criticized that part of  Marxism which saw the \"proletariat\" as the revolutionary class. He continued to hold other parts of Marxism as true.\n\nVan Heijenoort was spared the ordeal of McCarthyism because everything he published in Trotskyist organs appeared under one or other of more than a dozen pen names. Moreover, Feferman (1993) states that van Heijenoort the logician was quite reticent about his Trotskyist youth, and did not discuss politics. Nevertheless, in the last decade of his life he contributed to the history of the Trotskyist movement by writing the monograph With Trotsky in Exile (1978), editing a volume of Trotsky's correspondence (1980), and advising and working with the archivists at the Houghton Library in Harvard University, which holds many of Trotsky's papers from his years in exile.\n\nAcademic work\nAfter completing a Ph.D. in mathematics at New York University in 1949 under the supervision of J. J. Stoker, he taught mathematics there but evolved into a logician and philosopher of mathematics, in good part because of the influence of Georg Kreisel. He began teaching philosophy, first part-time at Columbia University, then full-time at Brandeis University, 1965-77. He spent much of his last decade at Stanford University, writing and editing eight books, including parts of the Collected Works of Kurt G\u00f6del.\n\nThe Source Book (van Heijenoort 1967), perhaps the most important book ever published on the history of logic and of the foundations of mathematics, is an anthology of translations. It begins with the first complete translation of Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift, which is followed by 45 historically important short pieces on mathematical logic and axiomatic set theory, originally published between 1889 and 1931. The anthology ends with G\u00f6del's landmark paper on the incompletability of Peano arithmetic. For more information on the period covered by this anthology, see Grattan-Guinness (2000).\n\nNearly all the content of the Source Book was difficult to access in all but the best North American university libraries (e.g., even the Library of Congress did not acquire a copy of the Begriffsschrift until 1964), and all but four pieces had to be translated from one of six continental European languages. When possible, the author of the original text was asked to review the translation of his work, and suggest corrections and amendments. Each piece included editorial footnotes, all references were combined into one list, and many misprints, inconsistencies, and errors in the originals were corrected. Especially important are the remarkable introductions to each translation, most written by van Heijenoort himself. A few were written by Willard Quine and Burton Dreben.\n\nThe Source Book did much to advance the view that modern logic begins with, and builds on, the Begriffsschrift.  Grattan-Guinness (2000) argues that this perspective on the history of logic is mistaken, because Frege employed an idiosyncratic notation and was far less read than, say, Peano. Ironically, van Heijenoort (1967a) is often cited by those who prefer the alternative model theoretic stance on logic and mathematics. Much of the history of that stance, whose leading lights include George Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, Ernst Schr\u00f6der, Leopold L\u00f6wenheim, Thoralf Skolem, Alfred Tarski, and Jaakko Hintikka, is covered in Brady (2000). The Source Book underrated the algebraic logic of De Morgan, Boole, Peirce, and Schr\u00f6der, but devoted more pages to Skolem than to anyone other than Frege, and included L\u00f6wenheim (1915), the founding paper on model theory.\n\nPersonal life\nVan Heijenoort had children with two of his four wives. While living with Trotsky in Coyoac\u00e1n, now a neighborhood of Mexico City, van Heijenoort's first wife left him after clashing with Trotsky's spouse. Van Heijenoort was also one of Frida Kahlo's lovers; in the film Frida, he is played by Felipe Fulop. Having parted company with Trotsky in 1939 for personal reasons, van Heijenoort was innocent of all circumstances leading to Trotsky's 1940 murder. Van Heijenoort himself was also murdered, in Mexico City 46 years later, by his estranged fourth spouse whom he was visiting at the time. She then took her own life.\n\nSelected works\n1967a. \"Logic as Language and Logic as Calculus\", Synthese 17: 324\u201330.\n1978. With Trotsky in Exile: From Prinkipo to Coyoac\u00e1n.

{"title": "Julia set", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set", "text": "thumb|256px|A Julia set\nthumb|256px|right|Three-dimensional slices through the (four-dimensional) Julia set of a function on the quaternions\nIn the context of complex dynamics, a topic of mathematics, the Julia set and the Fatou set are two complementary sets (Julia \"laces\" and Fatou \"dusts\") defined from a function. Informally, the Fatou set of the function consists of values with the property that all nearby values behave similarly under repeated iteration of the function, and the Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values.\nThus the behavior of the function on the Fatou set is \"regular\", while on the Julia set its behavior is \"chaotic\".\n\nThe Julia set of a function f is commonly denoted J(f), and the Fatou set is denoted F(f).Note that for other areas of mathematics the notation J(f) can also represent the Jacobian matrix of a real valued mapping f between smooth manifolds. These sets are named after the French mathematicians Gaston JuliaGaston Julia (1918) \"M\u00e9moire sur l'iteration des fonctions rationnelles\", Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es, vol. 8, pages 47\u2013245. and Pierre FatouPierre Fatou (1917) \"Sur les substitutions rationnelles\", Comptes Rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de Paris, vol. 164, pages 806\u2013808 and vol. 165, pages 992\u2013995. whose work began the study of complex dynamics during the early 20th century.\n\nFormal definition\nLet f(z) be a nonconstant holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere onto itself. Such f(z) are precisely the nonconstant complex rational functions, that is, , where p(z) and q(z) are complex polynomials. Assume that p and q  have no common roots and at least one has degree larger than 1. Then there is a finite number of open sets F1, ..., Fr, that are left invariant by f(z) and are such that:\n the union of the sets Fi is dense in the plane and\n f(z) behaves in a regular and equal way on each of the sets Fi.\n\nThe last statement means that the termini of the sequences of iterations generated by the points of Fi are either precisely the same set, which is then a finite cycle, or they are finite cycles of circular or annular shaped sets that are lying concentrically. In the first case the cycle is attracting, in the second it is neutral.\n\nThese sets Fi are the Fatou domains of f(z), and their union is the Fatou set F(f) of f(z). Each of the Fatou domains contains at least one critical point of f(z), that is, a (finite) point z satisfying , or , if the degree of the numerator p(z) is at least two larger than the degree of the denominator q(z), or if  for some c and a rational function g(z) satisfying this condition.\n\nThe complement of F(f) is the Julia set J(f) of f(z). If all the critical points are preperiodic, that is they are not periodic but eventually land on a periodic cycle, then J(f) is all the sphere; otherwise, J(f) is a nowhere dense set (it is without interior points) and an uncountable set (of the same cardinality as the real numbers). Like F(f), J(f) is left invariant by f(z), and on this set the iteration is repelling, meaning that  for all w in a neighbourhood of z (within J(f)). This means that f(z) behaves chaotically on the Julia set. Although there are points in the Julia set whose sequence of iterations is finite, there are only a countable number of such points (and they make up an infinitesimal part of the Julia set). The sequences generated by points outside this set behave chaotically, a phenomenon called deterministic chaos.\n\nThere has been extensive research on the Fatou set and Julia set of iterated rational functions, known as rational maps. For example, it is known that the Fatou set of a rational map has either 0, 1, 2 or infinitely many components.Beardon, Iteration of Rational Functions, Theorem 5.6.2. Each component of the Fatou set of a rational map can be classified into one of four different classes.Beardon, Theorem 7.1.1.\n\nEquivalent descriptions of the Julia set\n  J(f) is the smallest closed set containing at least three points which is completely invariant under f.\n  J(f) is the closure of the set of repelling periodic points.\n  For all but at most two points z \u2208 X, the Julia set is the set of limit points of the full backwards orbit . (This suggests a simple algorithm for plotting Julia sets, see below.)\n  If f is an entire function, then J(f) is the boundary of the set of points which converge to infinity under iteration.\n  If f is a polynomial, then J(f) is the boundary of the filled Julia set; that is, those points whose orbits under iterations of f remain bounded.\n\nProperties of the Julia set and Fatou set\nThe Julia set and the Fatou set of f are both completely invariant under iterations of the holomorphic function f:Beardon, Iteration of Rational Functions, Theorem 3.2.4.\n \n \n\nExamples\nFor  the Julia set is the unit circle and on this the iteration is given by doubling of angles (an operation that is chaotic on the points whose argument is not a rational fraction of ). There are two Fatou domains: the interior and the exterior of the circle, with iteration towards 0 and \u221e, respectively.\n\nFor  the Julia set is the line segment between \u22122 and 2.  There is one Fatou domain: the points not on the line segment iterate towards \u221e.  (Apart from a shift and scaling of the domain, this iteration is equivalent to  on the unit interval, which is commonly used as an example of chaotic system.)\n\nThe functions f and g are of the form , where c is a complex number. For such an iteration the Julia set is not in general a simple curve, but is a fractal, and for some values of c it can take surprising shapes. See the pictures below.\n\nthumb|right|Julia set (in white) for the rational function associated to Newton's method for f : z\u2192z3\u22121. Coloring of Fatou set  according to attractor (the roots of f)\nFor some functions f(z) we can say beforehand that the Julia set is a fractal and not a simple curve. This is because of the following result on the iterations of a rational function:\n\nTheorem. Each of the Fatou domains has the same boundary, which consequently is the Julia set.\n\nThis means that each point of the Julia set is a point of accumulation for each of the Fatou domains. Therefore, if there are more than two Fatou domains, each point of the Julia set must have points of more than two different open sets infinitely close, and this means that the Julia set cannot be a simple curve. This phenomenon happens, for instance, when f(z) is the Newton iteration for solving the equation :\n\nThe image on the right shows the case n = 3.\n\nQuadratic polynomials\nthumb|Julia sets for , where a ranges from 0 to \nthumb|A video of the Julia sets as above\nA very popular complex dynamical system is given by the family of complex quadratic polynomials, a special case of  rational maps. Such quadratic polynomials can be expressed as \n \nwhere c is a complex parameter. The Julia set for this system is the subset of the complex plane given by\n \nwhere  is the nth iterate of .\n\nthumb|Collection of Julia sets laid out in a 100\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 grid such that the center of each image corresponds to the same position in the complex plane as the value of the set. When laid out like this, the overall image resembles the Mandelbrot set.\n\nThe parameter plane of quadratic polynomials\u00a0\u2013 that is, the plane of possible c values\u00a0\u2013 gives rise to the famous Mandelbrot set. Indeed, the Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of all c such that  is connected. For parameters outside the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set is a Cantor space: in this case it is sometimes referred to as Fatou dust.\n\nIn many cases, the Julia set of c looks like the Mandelbrot set in sufficiently small neighborhoods of c. This is true, in particular, for so-called Misiurewicz parameters, i.e. parameters c for which the critical point is pre-periodic. For instance:\n At c = i, the shorter, front toe of the forefoot, the Julia set looks like a branched lightning bolt.\n At c = \u22122, the tip of the long spiky tail, the Julia set is a straight line segment.\n\nIn other words, the Julia sets  are locally similar around Misiurewicz points.Tan Lei, \"Similarity between the Mandelbrot set and Julia Sets\", Communications in Mathematical Physics 134 (1990), pp. 587\u2013617.\n\nExamples of Julia sets\n\nGeneralizations\nThe definition of Julia and Fatou sets easily carries over to the case of certain maps whose image contains their domain; most notably transcendental meromorphic functions and Adam Epstein's finite-type maps.\n\nJulia sets are also commonly defined in the study of dynamics in several complex variables.\n\n Pseudocode \nThe below pseudocode implementations hard code the functions for each fractal.

The equipotential lines for this function are concentric circles. As  we have\n\nwhere  is the sequence of iteration generated by z. For the more general iteration , it has been proved that if the Julia set is connected (that is, if c belongs to the (usual) Mandelbrot set), then there exist a biholomorphic map \u03c8 between the outer Fatou domain and the outer of the unit circle such that .Adrien Douady and John H. Hubbard, Etude dynamique des polyn\u00f4mes complexes, Pr\u00e9publications math\u00e9mathiques d'Orsay 2/4 (1984 / 1985) This means that the potential function on the outer Fatou domain defined by this correspondence is given by:\n\nThis formula has meaning also if the Julia set is not connected, so that we for all c can define the potential function on the Fatou domain containing \u221e by this formula. For a general rational function f(z) such that \u221e is a critical point and a fixed point, that is, such that the degree m of the numerator is at least two larger than the degree n of the denominator, we define the potential function on the Fatou domain containing \u221e by:\n\nwhere d = m \u2212 n is the degree of the rational function.\n\nIf N is a very large number (e.g. 10100), and if k is the first iteration number such that , we have that\n\nfor some real number , which should be regarded as the real iteration number, and we have that:\n\nwhere the last number is in the interval [0,\u00a01).\n\nFor iteration towards a finite attracting cycle of order r, we have that if z* is a point of the cycle, then  (the r-fold composition), and the number\n\nis the attraction of the cycle. If w is a point very near z* and w''' is w iterated r times, we have that\n\nTherefore the number  is almost independent of k. We define the potential function on the Fatou domain by:\n\nIf \u03b5 is a very small number and k is the first iteration number such that , we have that\n\nfor some real number , which should be regarded as the real iteration number, and we have that:\n\nIf the attraction is \u221e, meaning that the cycle is super-attracting, meaning again that one of the points of the cycle is a critical point, we must replace \u03b1 by\n\nwhere w' is w iterated r times and the formula for \u03c6(z) by:\n\nAnd now the real iteration number is given by:\n\nFor the colouring we must have a cyclic scale of colours (constructed mathematically, for instance) and containing H colours numbered from 0 to H\u22121 (H = 500, for instance). We multiply the real number  by a fixed real number determining the density of the colours in the picture, and take the integral part of this number modulo H.\n\nThe definition of the potential function and our way of colouring presuppose that the cycle is attracting, that is, not neutral. If the cycle is neutral, we cannot colour the Fatou domain in a natural way. As the terminus of the iteration is a revolving movement, we can, for instance, colour by the minimum distance from the cycle left fixed by the iteration.\n\nField lines\nthumb|right|The equipotential lines for iteration towards infinitythumb|right|Field lines for an iteration of the form In each Fatou domain (that is not neutral) there are two systems of lines orthogonal to each other: the equipotential lines (for the potential function or the real iteration number) and the field lines.\n\nIf we colour the Fatou domain according to the iteration number (and not the real iteration number , as defined in the previous section), the bands of iteration show the course of the equipotential lines. If the iteration is towards \u221e (as is the case with the outer Fatou domain for the usual iteration ), we can easily show the course of the field lines, namely by altering the colour according as the last point in the sequence of iteration is above or below the x-axis (first picture), but in this case (more precisely: when the Fatou domain is super-attracting) we cannot draw the field lines coherently - at least not by the method we describe here. In this case a field line is also called an external ray.\n\nLet z be a point in the attracting Fatou domain. If we iterate z a large number of times, the terminus of the sequence of iteration is a finite cycle C, and the Fatou domain is (by definition) the set of points whose sequence of iteration converges towards C. The field lines issue from the points of C and from the (infinite number of) points that iterate into a point of C. And they end on the Julia set in points that are non-chaotic (that is, generating a finite cycle). Let r be the order of the cycle C (its number of points) and let z* be a point in C. We have  (the r-fold composition), and we define the complex number \u03b1 by\n\nIf the points of C are , \u03b1 is the product of the r numbers . The real number 1/|\u03b1| is the attraction of the cycle, and our assumption that the cycle is neither neutral nor super-attracting, means that 1\u00a0<\u00a01/|\u03b1|\u00a0<\u00a0\u221e. The point z* is a fixed point for , and near this point the map  has (in connection with field lines) character of a rotation with the argument \u03b2 of \u03b1 (that is, ).\n\nIn order to colour the Fatou domain, we have chosen a small number \u03b5 and set the sequences of iteration  to stop when , and we colour the point z according to the number k (or the real iteration number, if we prefer a smooth colouring). If we choose a direction from z* given by an angle \u03b8, the field line issuing from z* in this direction consists of the points z such that the argument \u03c8 of the number  satisfies the condition that\n\nFor if we pass an iteration band in the direction of the field lines (and away from the cycle), the iteration number k is increased by 1 and the number \u03c8 is increased by \u03b2, therefore the number  is constant along the field line.\n\nthumb|right|Pictures in the field lines for an iteration of the form \n\nA colouring of the field lines of the Fatou domain means that we colour the spaces between pairs of field lines: we choose a number of regularly situated directions issuing from z*, and in each of these directions we choose two directions around this direction. As it can happen that the two field lines of a pair do not end in the same point of the Julia set, our coloured field lines can ramify (endlessly) in their way towards the Julia set. We can colour on the basis of the distance to the center line of the field line, and we can mix this colouring with the usual colouring. Such pictures can be very decorative (second picture).\n\nA coloured field line (the domain between two field lines) is divided up by the iteration bands, and such a part can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the unit square: the one coordinate is (calculated from) the distance from one of the bounding field lines, the other is (calculated from) the distance from the inner of the bounding iteration bands (this number is the non-integral part of the real iteration number). Therefore, we can put pictures into the field lines (third picture).\n\n Plotting the Julia set \nright|thumb|Binary decomposition of interior in case of internal angle 0\nMethods : \n Distance Estimation Method for Julia set (DEM/J)\n Inverse Iteration Method (IIM)\n\nUsing backwards (inverse) iteration (IIM) \nthumb|A Julia set plot, generated using random IIM \nright|thumb|A Julia set plot, generated using MIIM \nAs mentioned above, the Julia set can be found as the set of limit points of the set of pre-images of (essentially) any given point. So we can try to plot the Julia set of a given function as follows. Start with any point z we know to be in the Julia set, such as a repelling periodic point, and compute all pre-images of z under some high iterate  of f.\n\nUnfortunately, as the number of iterated pre-images grows exponentially, this is not feasible computationally. However, we can adjust this method, in a similar way as the \"random game\" method for iterated function systems. That is, in each step, we choose at random one of the inverse images of f.\n\nFor example, for the quadratic polynomial fc, the backwards iteration is described by\n\nAt each step, one of the two square roots is selected at random.\n\nNote that certain parts of the Julia set are quite difficult to access with the reverse Julia algorithm. For this reason, one must modify IIM/J ( it is called MIIM/J) or use other methods to produce better images.\n\nUsing DEM/J\n\nAs a Julia set is infinitely thin we cannot draw it effectively by backwards iteration from the pixels. It will appear fragmented because of the impracticality of examining infinitely many startpoints. Since the iteration count changes vigorously near the Julia set, a partial solution is to imply the outline of the set from  the nearest color contours, but the set will tend to look muddy.\n\nA better way to draw the Julia set in black and white is to estimate the distance of pixels (DEM) from the set and to color every pixel whose center is close to the set. The formula for the distance estimation is derived from the formula for the potential function \u03c6(z). When the equipotential lines for \u03c6(z) lie close, the number  is large, and conversely, therefore the equipotential lines for the function  should lie approximately regularly. It has been proven that the value found by this formula (up to a constant factor) converges towards the true distance for z converging towards the Julia set.\n\nWe assume that f(z) is rational, that is,  where p(z) and q(z) are complex polynomials of degrees m and n, respectively, and we have to find the derivative of the above expressions for \u03c6(z). And as it is only  that varies, we must calculate the derivative  of  with respect to z. But as  (the k-fold composition),  is the product of the numbers , and this sequence can be calculated recursively by , starting with  (before the calculation of the next iteration ).\n\nFor iteration towards \u221e (more precisely when m\u00a0\u2265\u00a0n\u00a0+\u00a02, so that \u221e is a super-attracting fixed point), we have\n\n(d = m\u00a0\u2212\u00a0n) and consequently:\n\nFor iteration towards a finite attracting cycle (that is not super-attracting) containing the point z* and having order r, we have\n\nand consequently:\n\nFor a super-attracting cycle, the formula is:\n\nWe calculate this number when the iteration stops. Note that the distance estimation is independent of the attraction of the cycle. This means that it has meaning for transcendental functions of \"degree infinity\" (e.g. sin(z) and tan(z)).\n\nBesides drawing of the boundary, the distance function can be introduced as a 3rd dimension to create a solid fractal landscape.\n\nSee also\n\n Douady rabbit\n Limit set\n Stable and unstable sets\n No wandering domain theorem\n Fatou components\n Chaos theory\n\n Notes \n\nReferences\n Lennart Carleson and Theodore W.

{"title": "Kelly Heaton", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Heaton", "text": "Kelly Heaton (born 1972) is a sculptor, scientist, perfumer, and spiritualist known for her combination of visual art with analog electrical engineering. She is the owner and perfumer for The Virginia Perfume Company.\n\nEducation\nHeaton received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1994, and her Master of Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2000.\n\nShe was awarded a Jacob K. Javits Fellowship to attend the Master of Fine Arts program at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. Heaton went on to study at the MIT Media Lab and graduated with a MS from MIT in 2000.\n\nThe subject of her Master's thesis was \"physical pixels\", a sculptural effort to liberate computer graphics from the flat screen of a computer monitor. Heaton's suite of prototypes included the \"Digital Palette\" for sequencing loops of colored-light animation, and \"Peano\", a system of reconfigurable blocks, each of which behaved as an RGB pixel. In 2001, her thesis work was awarded the L'Oreal Promotion Prize in the Art and Science of Color.\n\nCareer\nIn the early 2000s, Heaton developed a reputation for complex, obsessive and often humorous installations involving technology. During her time at the MIT Center for Advanced Visual Studies, she worked with engineer Steven Gray to create her first major sculpture: \"The Pool\" of \"Reflection Loop\", a large concave slab embedded with 400 reprogrammed Furby dolls arranged in the pattern of water molecules. The Furby dolls were altered to mirror the presence of a viewer, creating a noisy, amusing and weird reflection of the audience until the robotic toys eventually \"died\" from excessive use. \"Reflection Loop\" was selected for the 2001 Annual Exhibition of the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, Heaton was offered her first solo exhibition in New York at Bitforms gallery.\n\nHeaton went on to numerous shows and residencies, including the now-defunct Art Interactive in Cambridge, Massachusetts and a joint appointment with the Department of Computer Science and Department of Information Science and Information Studies at Duke University. In 2003, Heaton's installation \"Live Pelt\" premiered at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in New York City. The central piece of the show was a coat (\"The Surrogate\") made from 64 used Tickle Me Elmo dolls that Heaton \"trapped\" on online auction while documenting every detail of her transactions with other eBay members. The acquired Elmo dolls were eviscerated for their furry pelts and laughing electronics, all of which Heaton re-engineered into a coat that giggles and quivers when touched, like a surrogate lover. Filmmakers Shambhavi Kaul and Joshua Gibson collaborated with Heaton to document the various personalities of her process.\n\nIn early 2004, Heaton moved to Switzerland where she lived and worked until 2009 as a part-time innovation consultant for the Diabetes Care division of Roche Diagnostics. During this time, she co-authored several patents related to methods of data visualization for continuous glucose data. Heaton also taught herself analog electrical engineering and developed another body of work, \"The Parallel Series\".\n\nHeaton's 2015 exhibition, \"Pollination\" involved sculpture, electronics, perfume, and mixed media art. The exhibition included \"The Beekeeper\", a floor-to-ceiling kinetic sculpture that Heaton referred to as \"an energetic self-portrait\".\n\nA self-taught perfumer, Heaton has created several fragrances, including \"Smells Like Weeds (The Queen of Hungry Spirits)\", a perfume made using bee-friendly plants; and \"Smells Like Money (Hungry Spirits)\", a perfume extracted from hundreds of dollar bills using the labor-intensive method of cold enfleurage.\n\nIn 2014, Heaton founded The Virginia Perfume Company to create authentic, small-batch perfumes based on old-world techniques.\n\nPersonal life\nHeaton lives in Virginia with her husband and stepchildren.\n\nSolo exhibitions\n 2015 Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, New York, NY, \"Pollination,\" September 12 \u2013 October 17. \n 2013 Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, New York, NY, \"ADAA The Art Show 2013,\" Park Avenue Armory, March 6\u201310.\n 2012 Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, New York, NY, \"The Parallel Series,\" September 8 \u2013 October 27.\n 2003 Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, New York, NY, \"Live Pelt,\" September 6 \u2013 October 11.

{"title": "Liceo classico Cavour", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liceo_classico_Cavour", "text": "thumb|300 px| Liceo Ginnasio statale \"Camillo Benso di Cavour\", corso Tassoni 15, 10143 Turin, Italy. Main entrance (1931).\nLiceo Ginnasio statale \"Camillo Benso di Cavour\" is the oldest Liceo classico in Turin and one among the oldest and most prominent high schools in Italy, for pupils aged 14 to 19. It was transferred to its present location in 1931.\n\nHistory\nIt was founded in 1568 with the name of Collegio dei Nobili (it. for College of Nobles) by Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, after he moved (1563) the capital of his States from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin, and was assigned to Jesuits. For many centuries it has been the most prominent high school in the Duchy of Savoy and thereafter (from 1713) in the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1787 the College moved from its older Palace (assigned later to Accademia delle Scienze and to Museo Egizio) to the Palace of the (suppressed) Convento del \nCarmine. It became a Lyc\u00e9e (on December,23rd,1805) in Piedmont annexed to the First French Empire. At the fall of Napoleon I, King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia restored it as Collegio Reale Maggiore (Royal College) in 1818 and reassigned it to Jesuits. In 1848 after the First Italian War of Independence under King Charles Albert of Sardinia it was the first educational institution in the Kingdom to come under direct control of the State. The College became a Liceo classico in 1859 under the Law of Education of the Kingdom of Sardinia and courses began in 1860-1861; in 1865 the school was finally named after Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour; in these years (1861\u20131865) it was the leading high school of the capital of the united Kingdom of Italy. From 1911 to 1923 a Liceo Moderno was added to the Liceo classico. In 1931 the school moved to corso Tassoni, 15, in a new location, due to increasing numbers of students.\n\nTeaching\n\nThe original curriculum (1568) concentrated on Rhetoric and Latin; later (from 1848) the emphasis was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Classical Greek, and (with changes made in 1923 and later improvements in courses of study) it still emphasizes on Latin language (from first to fifth year) and Latin Literature (third to fifth year), Ancient Greek Language (first to fifth year) and Ancient Greek literature (third to fifth year), Humanities and Classics, although with the increasing support of sciences.\n\nLiceo Cavour today\nLiceo Cavour provides an exceptionally good quality of education, for which it has always been renowned in Turin. The school ranked first in the research made by the Fondazione Giovanni Agnelli and published in January 2009. By now it is a larger school than it has been for much of its history. In the 1870s there were about 350 boys; today they are about 930-950. Almost all of the school's pupils go to universities. In 2009-2010 the TV Series \u00abFuori classe\u00bb was partially filmed at the school (the fiction, about an Italian high school and its teachers and students, has been broadcast from January 2011, by the Italian state owned public service broadcaster RAI).\n\nAlumni\nLiceo Cavour has a long list of distinguished former pupils, including Luigi Einaudi, who served (1948\u20131955) as second President of the Italian Republic. Past pupils include the mathematician Giuseppe Peano, Agostino Richelmy, who served as Archbishop of Turin from 1897, and Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, the poet Guido Gozzano (for three years), Cesare Pavese (for three years), Ludovico Geymonat, Franco Venturi, Raf Vallone, and Livio Berruti, the surprising winner of the 200 m in the 1960 Summer Olympics\n\nBibliography\nGolzio, Armando, Liceo Cavour.

{"title": "Mario Livio", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Livio", "text": "Mario Livio (born 1945) is an Israeli-American astrophysicist and an author of works that popularize science and mathematics. From 1991 till 2015 he was an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates the Hubble Space Telescope. He is perhaps best known for his book on the irrational number phi: The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number (2002). The book won the Peano Prize and the International Pythagoras Prize for popular books on mathematics.\n\nLife and scientific career\nLivio was born in Bucharest in Romania, and lived with his grandparents when his mother and father were forced to flee the country for political reasons. He left Romania at age five with his grandparents, and the family settled in Israel. He served with the Israeli Defense Forces as a paramedic in the 1967 Six-Day War, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and the 1982 Lebanon War.\n\nLivio earned a B.S. degree in physics and mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a M.S. degree in theoretical particle physics at the Weizmann Institute, and a Ph.D. in theoretical astrophysics at Tel Aviv University. He was a professor of physics at the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology from 1981 to 1991, before moving to the Space Telescope Science Institute.\n\nFrom 2000 Livio focused his research on supernova explosions and their use in determining the rate of expansion of the universe. He has also studied so-called dark energy, black holes, and the formation of planetary systems around young stars. He has contributed to hundreds of papers in peer-reviewed journals on astrophysics. In 2009, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Council elected him as a Fellow of the AAAS. Livio was cited for his \"distinguished contributions to astrophysics through research on stars and galaxies and through communicating and interpreting science and mathematics to the public.\" He is also cited in the American Men and Women of Science.\n\nLivio has been nominated three times by the USA Science and Engineering Festival as one of the \"Nifty Fifty Speakers\" to talk about his work and career to middle and high school students in 2010, 2011, and 2013. Other honors include: Carnegie Centenary Professor in 2003, Danz Distinguished Lecturer in 2006, Resnick Distinguished Lecturer in 2006, Iben Distinguished Lecturer in 2008, and Terzian Distinguished Lecturer in 2011.\n\nLivio and his wife Sofie, a microbiologist, have three children.\n\nPopular works\nFor almost twenty years Livio has popularized astronomy and mathematics through books, lectures, magazine articles, and radio and television appearances. He has delivered popular lectures at , the Smithsonian Institution, the Hayden Planetarium, the Maryland Institute College of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and the Glasgow Science Centre. He has appeared on radio and TV outlets including PBS, NPR and CBS to discuss scientific and mathematical subjects.\n\nLivio's first book of popular science was The Accelerating Universe (2000), which explained in layman's terms the theory that the universe was expanding at a faster and faster rate. He explored the possible causes and the theoretical implications of continuing expansion, especially its implications for beliefs about the \"beauty\" of the scientific laws that govern the cosmos.\n\nA self-described \"art fanatic\" who owns hundreds of art books, Livio put this interest to good use in his next book, The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi (2002). He traced the influence of the golden ratio through many centuries of art, architecture, music, and even stock market theories. Dan Brown, author of The Da Vinci Code, endorsed the book stating, \"Livio unveils the history and mystery of the remarkable number phi in such a way that math-buffs and math-phobes alike can celebrate her wonder ... you will never again look at a pyramid, pinecone or Picasso in the same light.\"\n\nThe Equation That Couldn't Be Solved (2005) explains how efforts to solve the quintic equation led to group theory and to the mathematics of symmetry. He emphasizes the crucial roles of \u00c9variste Galois and Niels Henrik Abel in developing this branch of mathematics. He also \"keeps the hard stuff to a minimum,\" in the words of a Publishers Weekly review. The book contains biographical sketches of Galois, Abel and several other mathematicians.\n\nIs God A Mathematician? was released on January 6, 2009. It discusses the uncanny ability of mathematics to describe and predict accurately the physical world. Livio also attempts to answer a question with which mathematicians and philosophers have struggled for centuries: Is mathematics ultimately invented or discovered? The book was selected by the Washington Post as one of the best books of 2009, and it was also selected as a \"2009 Borders Original Voices\" finalist.\n\nBrilliant Blunders (2013) summarizes serious mistakes by five notable figures in science: Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin, Linus Pauling, Fred Hoyle, and Albert Einstein.\n\nHis latest book (July 2017) is Why?

{"title": "Markov's principle", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_principle", "text": "thumb|250px|An artistic representation of a Turing machine. Markov's principle says that if it is impossible that a Turing machine will not halt, then it must halt.\n\nMarkov's principle, named after Andrey Markov Jr, is a specific statement in computability theory that is obviously true classically (i.e. it is a logical validity), but must be proved when using constructive mathematics. \nThere are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle.\n\n Statements of the principle \nIn the language of computability theory, Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both computably enumerable, then the set is decidable. \n\nIn predicate logic, if P is a predicate over the natural numbers, it is expressed as:\n\nThat is, if P is decidable, and it cannot be false for every natural number n, then it is true for some\u00a0n.  (In general, a predicate P over some domain is called decidable if for every x in the domain, either P(x) is true, or P(x) is not true, which is not always the case constructively.)\n\nIt is equivalent in the language of arithmetic to:\n\nfor  a total recursive function on the natural numbers.\n\nIt is equivalent, in the language of real analysis, to the following principles:\n\n For each real number x, if it is contradictory that x is equal to 0, then there exists y\u00a0\u2208\u00a0Q such that 0\u00a0<\u00a0y\u00a0<\u00a0|x|, often expressed by saying that x is apart from, or constructively unequal to,\u00a00.\n For each real number x, if it is contradictory that x is equal to\u00a00, then there exists y\u00a0\u2208\u00a0R such that xy\u00a0=\u00a01.\n\n Realizability \n\nIf constructive arithmetic is translated using realizability into a classical meta-theory that proves the -consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying Heyting arithmetic), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that  is not everywhere false to the unbounded search that successively checks if  is true. If  is not everywhere false, then by -consistency there must be a term for which  holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however  does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory),  must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer.\n\nIf instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Heyting arithmetic; and it is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis and Markov's principle if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Peano arithmetic. \n\nModified realizability does not justify Markov's principle, even if classical logic is used in the meta-theory: there is no realizer in the language of simply typed lambda calculus as this language is not Turing-complete and arbitrary loops cannot be defined in it.\n\n Markov's rule \nMarkov's rule is the formulation of Markov's principle as a rule. It states that  is derivable as soon as  is, for  decidable. It was proved by Anne S. TroelstraAnne S. Troelstra. Metamathematical Investigation of Intuitionistic Arithmetic and Analysis, Springer Verlag (1973), Theorem 4.2.4 of the 2nd edition. that Markov's rule is an admissible rule in Heyting arithmetic. Later on, the logician Harvey Friedman showed that Markov's rule is an admissible rule in all of intuitionistic logic, Heyting arithmetic, and various other intuitionistic theories,Harvey Friedman.

Editors, Higher Set Theory, Volume 699 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Springer Verlag (1978), pp. 21\u201328. using the Friedman translation.\n\n Weak Markov's principle \nA weaker form of Markov's principle may be stated in the language of analysis as\n\n \n\nThis form can be justified by Brouwer's continuity principles, whereas the stronger form contradicts them. Thus it can be derived from intuitionistic, realizability, and classical reasoning, in each case for different reasons, but this principle is not valid in the general constructive sense of Bishop.Ulrich Kohlenbach, \"On weak Markov's principle\".

Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a metatheory, and may reference concepts that are present in the metatheory but not the object theory.\n\nA formal system is determined by a formal language and a deductive system (axioms and rules of inference). The formal system can be used to prove particular sentences of the formal language with that system. Metatheorems, however, are proved externally to the system in question, in its metatheory. Common metatheories used in logic are set theory (especially in model theory) and primitive recursive arithmetic (especially in proof theory).

As the wedges narrow, the fraction of area removed decreases exponentially, so the area remaining in the final curve is nonzero.\nIn mathematics, an Osgood curve is a non-self-intersecting curve (either a Jordan curve or a Jordan arc) of positive area. More formally, these are curves in the Euclidean plane with positive two-dimensional Lebesgue measure.\n\nHistory\nThe first examples were found by  and . Both examples have positive area in parts of the curve, but zero area in other parts; this flaw was corrected by , who found a curve that has positive area in every neighborhood of each of its points, based on an earlier construction of Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski. Knopp's example has the additional advantage that its area can be controlled to be any desired fraction of the area of its convex hull.; , Section 8.3, The Osgood Curves of Sierp\u00ednski and Knopp, pp.\u00a0136\u2013140.\n\nFractal construction\nAlthough most space-filling curves are not Osgood curves (they have positive area but often include infinitely many self-intersections, failing to be Jordan curves) it is possible to modify the recursive construction of space-filling curves or other fractal curves to obtain an Osgood curve.; ; ). For instance, Knopp's construction involves recursively splitting triangles into pairs of smaller triangles, meeting at a shared vertex, by removing triangular wedges. When the removed wedges at each level of this construction cover the same fraction of the area of their triangles, the result is a Ces\u00e0ro fractal such as the Koch snowflake,\nbut removing wedges whose areas shrink more rapidly produces an Osgood curve.\n\nDenjoy\u2013Riesz construction\nAnother way to construct an Osgood curve is to form a two-dimensional version of the Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set, a totally disconnected point set with nonzero area,\nand then apply the Denjoy\u2013Riesz theorem according to which every bounded and totally disconnected subset of the plane is a subset of a Jordan curve.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:Curves\nCategory:Fractal curves"}
{"title": "Parity of zero", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_zero", "text": "thumb|alt=Empty balance scale|The weighing pans of this balance scale contain zero objects, divided into two equal groups.\n\nZero is an even number. In other words, its parity\u2014the quality of an integer being even or odd\u2014is even. This can be easily verified based on the definition of \"even\": it is an integer multiple of 2, specifically . As a result, zero shares all the properties that characterize even numbers: for example, 0 is neighbored on both sides by odd numbers, any decimal integer has the same parity as its last digit\u2014so, since 10 is even 0 will be even, and if  is even then  has the same parity as \u2014and  and  always have the same parity.\n\nZero also fits into the patterns formed by other even numbers. The parity rules of arithmetic, such as , require 0 to be even. Zero is the additive identity element  of the group of even integers, and it is the starting case from which other even natural numbers are recursively defined. Applications of this recursion from graph theory to computational geometry rely on zero being even. Not only is 0 divisible by 2, it is divisible by every power of 2, which is relevant to the binary numeral system used by computers. In this sense, 0 is the \"most even\" number of all. \"By the same test zero surpasses all numbers in 'evenness.'\";  \"Thus, the integer  is the most 'even.'\n\nAmong the general public, the parity of zero can be a source of confusion. In reaction time experiments, most people are slower to identify 0 as even than 2, 4, 6, or 8. Some students of mathematics\u2014and some teachers\u2014think that zero is odd, or both even and odd, or neither. Researchers in mathematics education propose that these misconceptions can become learning opportunities. Studying equalities like  can address students' doubts about calling 0 a number and using it in arithmetic. Class discussions can lead students to appreciate the basic principles of mathematical reasoning, such as the importance of definitions. Evaluating the parity of this exceptional number is an early example of a pervasive theme in mathematics: the abstraction of a familiar concept to an unfamiliar setting.\n\nWhy zero is even\nThe standard definition of \"even number\" can be used to directly prove that zero is even. A number is called \"even\" if it is an integer multiple of 2. As an example, the reason that 10 is even is that it equals . In the same way, zero is an integer multiple of 2, namely  so zero is even.: Lemma B.2.2, The integer 0 is even and is not odd. Penner uses the mathematical symbol \u2203, the existential quantifier, to state the proof: \"To see that 0 is even, we must prove that  and this follows from the equality .\"\n\nIt is also possible to explain why zero is even without referring to formal definitions. discuss this challenge for the elementary-grades teacher, who wants to give mathematical reasons for mathematical facts, but whose students neither use the same definition, nor would understand it if it were introduced. The following explanations make sense of the idea that zero is even in terms of fundamental number concepts. From this foundation, one can provide a rationale for the definition itself\u2014and its applicability to zero.\n\nBasic explanations\nthumb|alt=On the left, boxes with 0, 2, and 4 white objects in pairs; on the right, 1, 3, and 5 objects, with the unpaired object in red|The box with 0 objects has no red object left over.Compare  Fig. 1\nGiven a set of objects, one uses a number to describe how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it is the number of objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even. \"...numbers answer the question How many? for the set of objects ... zero is the number property of the empty set ... If the elements of each set are marked off in groups of two ... then the number of that set is an even number.\"\n\nThese ideas can be illustrated by drawing objects in pairs. It is difficult to depict zero groups of two, or to emphasize the nonexistence of a leftover object, so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero. For example, in the group of five objects, there are two pairs. More importantly, there is a leftover object, so 5 is odd. In the group of four objects, there is no leftover object, so 4 is even. In the group of just one object, there are no pairs, and there is a leftover object, so 1 is odd. In the group of zero objects, there is no leftover object, so 0 is even. \"Zero groups of two stars are circled. No stars are left. Therefore, zero is an even number.\"\n\nThere is another concrete definition of evenness: if the objects in a set can be placed into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects is even. This definition is equivalent to the first one. Again, zero is even because the empty set can be divided into two groups of zero items each.\n\nNumbers can also be visualized as points on a number line. When even and odd numbers are distinguished from each other, their pattern becomes obvious, especially if negative numbers are included:\ncenter|alt=Integers \u22124 through 10; even numbers are open circles; odd numbers are dots\nThe even and odd numbers alternate. Starting at any even number, counting up or down by twos reaches the other even numbers, and there is no reason to skip over zero.; compare her Fig. 3. \"If the even numbers are identified in some special way ... there is no reason at all to omit zero from the pattern.\"\n\nWith the introduction of multiplication, parity can be approached in a more formal way using arithmetic expressions. Every integer is either of the form  or  the former numbers are even and the latter are odd. For example, 1 is odd because  and 0 is even because  Making a table of these facts then reinforces the number line picture above. \"At a more advanced level ... numbers expressed as  are even numbers ... zero fits nicely into this pattern.\"\n\nDefining parity\nThe precise definition of a mathematical term, such as \"even\" meaning \"integer multiple of two\", is ultimately a convention. Unlike \"even\", some mathematical terms are purposefully constructed to exclude trivial or degenerate cases. Prime numbers are a famous example. Before the 20th century, definitions of primality were inconsistent, and significant mathematicians such as Goldbach, Lambert, Legendre, Cayley, and Kronecker wrote that 1 was prime. The modern definition of \"prime number\" is \"positive integer with exactly 2 factors\", so 1 is not prime. This definition can be rationalized by observing that it more naturally suits mathematical theorems that concern the primes. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is easier to state when 1 is not considered prime. \"The seemingly arbitrary exclusion of 1 from the definition of a prime \u2026 does not express some deep fact about numbers: it just happens to be a useful convention, adopted so there is only one way of factorizing any given number into primes.\" For a more detailed discussion, see .\n\nIt would be possible to similarly redefine the term \"even\" in a way that no longer includes zero. However, in this case, the new definition would make it more difficult to state theorems concerning the even numbers. Already the effect can be seen in the algebraic rules governing even and odd numbers. The most relevant rules concern addition, subtraction, and multiplication:\neven \u00b1 even = even\nodd \u00b1 odd = even\neven \u00d7 integer = even\nInserting appropriate values into the left sides of these rules, one can produce 0 on the right sides:\n2 \u2212 2 = 0\n\u22123 + 3 = 0\n4 \u00d7 0 = 0\n\nThe above rules would therefore be incorrect if zero were not even. At best they would have to be modified. For example, one test study guide asserts that even numbers are characterized as integer multiples of two, but zero is \"neither even nor odd\". Accordingly, the guide's rules for even and odd numbers contain exceptions:\neven \u00b1 even = even (or zero)\nodd \u00b1 odd = even (or zero)\neven \u00d7 nonzero integer = even These rules are given, but they are not quoted verbatim.\n\nMaking an exception for zero in the definition of evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers. From another perspective, taking the rules obeyed by positive even numbers and requiring that they continue to hold for integers forces the usual definition and the evenness of zero.\n\nMathematical contexts\nCountless results in number theory invoke the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, the fact that positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it is a product of 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the M\u00f6bius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the M\u00f6bius inversion formula to work.\n\nNot being odd\nA number  is odd if there is an integer  such that . One way to prove that zero is not odd is by contradiction: if  then , which is not an integer. Since zero is not odd, if an unknown number is proven to be odd, then it cannot be zero. This apparently trivial observation can provide a convenient and revealing proof explaining why a number is nonzero.\n\nA classic result of graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always has at least one vertex of even degree. (The statement itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) For isolated vertices see p. 149; for groups see p. 311. In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.\n\nSperner's lemma is a more advanced application of the same strategy. The lemma states that a certain kind of coloring on a triangulation of a simplex has a subsimplex that contains every color. Rather than directly construct such a subsimplex, it is more convenient to prove that there exists an odd number of such subsimplices through an induction argument. A stronger statement of the lemma then explains why this number is odd: it naturally breaks down as  when one considers the two possible orientations of a simplex.\n\nEven-odd alternation\nright|thumb|alt=0->1->2->3->4->5->6->... in alternating colors|Recursive definition of natural number parity\n\nThe fact that zero is even, together with the fact that even and odd numbers alternate, is enough to determine the parity of every other natural number. This idea can be formalized into a recursive definition of the set of even natural numbers:\n0 is even.\n(n + 1) is even if and only if n is not even.\nThis definition has the conceptual advantage of relying only on the minimal foundations of the natural numbers: the existence of 0 and of successors. As such, it is useful for computer logic systems such as LF and the Isabelle theorem prover.; ;  With this definition, the evenness of zero is not a theorem but an axiom. Indeed, \"zero is an even number\" may be interpreted as one of the Peano axioms, of which the even natural numbers are a model. A similar construction extends the definition of parity to transfinite ordinal numbers: every limit ordinal is even, including zero, and successors of even ordinals are odd.\n\nleft|thumb|alt=Non-convex polygon penetrated by an arrow, labeled 0 on the outside, 1 on the inside, 2 on the outside, etc. |Point in polygon test\nThe classic point in polygon test from computational geometry applies the above ideas. To determine if a point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts the number of times the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if the point is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.\n\nright|thumb|alt=A graph with 9 vertices, alternating colors, labeled by distance from the vertex on the left |Constructing a bipartition\nIn graph theory, a bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices are split into two colors, such that neighboring vertices have different colors. If a connected graph has no odd cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base vertex is colored differently from its neighbors, which lie at a distance of 1.; \n\nAlgebraic patterns\nleft|thumb|alt=Integers \u22124 through +4 arranged in a corkscrew, with a straight line running through the evens |2Z (blue) as subgroup of Z\nIn abstract algebra, the even integers form various algebraic structures that require the inclusion of zero. The fact that the additive identity (zero) is even, together with the evenness of sums and additive inverses of even numbers and the associativity of addition, means that the even integers form a group. Moreover, the group of even integers under addition is a subgroup of the group of all integers; this is an elementary example of the subgroup concept. The earlier observation that the rule \"even \u2212 even = even\" forces 0 to be even is part of a general pattern: any nonempty subset of an additive group that is closed under subtraction must be a subgroup, and in particular, must contain the identity.\n\nSince the even integers form a subgroup of the integers, they partition the integers into cosets. These cosets may be described as the equivalence classes of the following equivalence relation:  if  is even. Here, the evenness of zero is directly manifested as the reflexivity of the binary relation ~. There are only two cosets of this subgroup\u2014the even and odd numbers\u2014so it has index 2.\n\nAnalogously, the alternating group is a subgroup of index 2 in the symmetric group on n letters. The elements of the alternating group, called even permutations, are the products of even numbers of transpositions. The identity map, an empty product of no transpositions, is an even permutation since zero is even; it is the identity element of the group.; \n\nThe rule \"even \u00d7 integer = even\" means that the even numbers form an ideal in the ring of integers, and the above equivalence relation can be described as equivalence modulo this ideal. In particular, even integers are exactly those integers k where  This formulation is useful for investigating integer zeroes of polynomials.\n\n2-adic order\nThere is a sense in which some multiples of 2 are \"more even\" than others. Multiples of 4 are called doubly even, since they can be divided by 2 twice. Not only is zero divisible by 4, zero has the unique property of being divisible by every power of 2, so it surpasses all other numbers in \"evenness\".\n\nOne consequence of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley\u2013Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.\n\nAlthough 0 is divisible by 2 more times than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be the number of times n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; no matter how many times it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. Of a general prime p: \"The reasoning here is that we can certainly divide 0 by p, and the answer is 0, which we can divide by p, and the answer is 0, which we can divide by p\u2026\" (ellipsis in original) This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.\n\nThe powers of two\u20141, 2, 4, 8, ...\u2014form a simple sequence of numbers of increasing 2-order. In the 2-adic numbers, such sequences actually converge to zero.\n\nEducation\nthumb|upright=1.8|alt=Bar chart; see description in body text|Percentage responses over timeThe subject of the parity of zero is often treated within the first two or three years of primary education, as the concept of even and odd numbers is introduced and developed.This is the timeframe in United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and Israel; see .\n\nStudents' knowledge\nThe chart on the right depicts children's beliefs about the parity of zero, as they progress from Year 1 to Year 6 of the English education system. The data is from Len Frobisher, who conducted a pair of surveys of English schoolchildren. Frobisher was interested in how knowledge of single-digit parity translates to knowledge of multiple-digit parity, and zero figures prominently in the results.\n\nIn a preliminary survey of nearly 400 seven-year-olds, 45% chose even over odd when asked the parity of zero.; results are from the survey conducted in the mid-summer term of 1992. A follow-up investigation offered more choices: neither, both, and don't know. This time the number of children in the same age range identifying zero as even dropped to 32%. \"The percentage of Year 2 children deciding that zero is an even number is much lower than in the previous study, 32 per cent as opposed to 45 per cent\" Success in deciding that zero is even initially shoots up and then levels off at around 50% in Years 3 to 6. \"The success in deciding that zero is an even number did not continue to rise with age, with approximately one in two children in each of Years 2 to 6 putting a tick in the 'evens' box ...\" For comparison, the easiest task, identifying the parity of a single digit, levels off at about 85% success.; these results are from the February 1999 study, including 481 children, from three schools at a variety of attainment levels.\n\nIn interviews, Frobisher elicited the students' reasoning. One fifth-year decided that 0 was even because it was found on the 2 times table. A couple of fourth-years realized that zero can be split into equal parts. Another fourth-year reasoned \"1 is odd and if I go down it's even.\", attributed to \"Jonathan\" The interviews also revealed the misconceptions behind incorrect responses. A second-year was \"quite convinced\" that zero was odd, on the basis that \"it is the first number you count\"., attributed to \"Joseph\" A fourth-year referred to 0 as \"none\" and thought that it was neither odd nor even, since \"it's not a number\"., attributed to \"Richard\" In another study, Annie Keith observed a class of 15 second grade students who convinced each other that zero was an even number based on even-odd alternation and on the possibility of splitting a group of zero things in two equal groups. \"There was little disagreement on the idea of zero being an even number. The students convinced the few who were not sure with two arguments. The first argument was that numbers go in a pattern ...odd, even, odd, even, odd, even... and since two is even and one is odd then the number before one, that is not a fraction, would be zero. So zero would need to be even. The second argument was that if a person has zero things and they put them into two equal groups then there would be zero in each group. The two groups would have the same amount, zero\"\n\nMore in-depth investigations were conducted by Esther Levenson, Pessia Tsamir, and Dina Tirosh, who interviewed a pair of sixth-grade students who were performing highly in their mathematics class. One student preferred deductive explanations of mathematical claims, while the other preferred practical examples. Both students initially thought that 0 was neither even nor odd, for different reasons. Levenson et al. demonstrated how the students' reasoning reflected their concepts of zero and division.\nClaims made by students\"Zero is not even or odd.\"\"Zero could be even.\"\"Zero is not odd.\"\"Zero has to be an even.\"\"Zero is not an even number.\"\"Zero is always going to be an even number.\"\"Zero is not always going to be an even number.\"\"Zero is even.\"\"Zero is special.\"\n\nDeborah Loewenberg Ball analyzed a third grade class students' ideas about even and odd numbers and zero, which they had just been discussing with a group of fourth-graders. The students discussed the parity of zero, the rules for even numbers, and how mathematics is done. The claims about zero took many forms, as seen in the list on the right., Figure 1.5 \"Mathematical claims about zero.\" Ball and her coauthors argued that the episode demonstrated how students can \"do mathematics in school\", as opposed to the usual reduction of the discipline to the mechanical solution of exercises.\n\nOne of the themes in the research literature is the tension between students' concept images of parity and their concept definitions.;  Levenson et al.'s sixth-graders both defined even numbers as multiples of 2 or numbers divisible by 2, but they were initially unable to apply this definition to zero, because they were unsure how to multiply or divide zero by 2. The interviewer eventually led them to conclude that zero was even; the students took different routes to this conclusion, drawing on a combination of images, definitions, practical explanations, and abstract explanations. In another study, David Dickerson and Damien Pitman examined the use of definitions by five advanced undergraduate mathematics majors. They found that the undergraduates were largely able to apply the definition of \"even\" to zero, but they were still not convinced by this reasoning, since it conflicted with their concept images.\n\nTeachers' knowledge\nResearchers of mathematics education at the University of Michigan have included the true-or-false prompt \"0 is an even number\" in a database of over 250 questions designed to measure teachers' content knowledge. For them, the question exemplifies \"common knowledge ... that any well-educated adult should have\", and it is \"ideologically neutral\" in that the answer does not vary between traditional and reform mathematics. In a 2000\u20132004 study of 700 primary teachers in the United States, overall performance on these questions significantly predicted improvements in students' standardized test scores after taking the teachers' classes. In a more in-depth 2008\u00a0study, the researchers found a school where all of the teachers thought that zero was neither odd nor even, including one teacher who was exemplary by all other measures. The misconception had been spread by a math coach in their building.\n\nIt is uncertain how many teachers harbor misconceptions about zero. The Michigan studies did not publish data for individual questions. Betty Lichtenberg, an associate professor of mathematics education at the University of South Florida, in a 1972 study reported that when a group of prospective elementary school teachers were given a true-or-false test including the item \"Zero is an even number\", they found it to be a \"tricky question\", with about two thirds answering \"False\".\n\nImplications for instruction\nMathematically, proving that zero is even is a simple matter of applying a definition, but more explanation is needed in the context of education. One issue concerns the foundations of the proof; the definition of \"even\" as \"integer multiple of 2\" is not always appropriate. A student in the first years of primary education may not yet have learned what \"integer\" or \"multiple\" means, much less how to multiply with 0.. See also Ball's keynote for further discussion of appropriate definitions. Additionally, stating a definition of parity for all integers can seem like an arbitrary conceptual shortcut if the only even numbers investigated so far have been positive. It can help to acknowledge that as the number concept is extended from positive integers to include zero and negative integers, number properties such as parity are also extended in a nontrivial way.As concluded by , referencing \n\nNumerical cognition\nthumb|alt=Numbers 0\u20138, repeated twice, in a complex arrangement; the 0s are on top, separated by a dotted line|Statistical analysis of experimental data, showing separation of 0. In this smallest space analysis, only the clustering of data is meaningful; the axes are arbitrary.: \"It can also be seen that zero strongly differs from all other numbers regardless of whether it is responded to with the left or the right hand. (See the line that separates zero from the other numbers.)\"\n\nAdults who do believe that zero is even can nevertheless be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, a pioneer in the field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time\u2014a small difference but a significant one.See data throughout , and summary by .\n\nDehaene's experiments were not designed specifically to investigate 0 but to compare competing models of how parity information is processed and extracted. The most specific model, the mental calculation hypothesis, suggests that reactions to 0 should be fast; 0 is a small number, and it is easy to calculate . (Subjects are known to compute and name the result of multiplication by zero faster than multiplication of nonzero numbers, although they are slower to verify proposed results like .) The results of the experiments suggested that something quite different was happening: parity information was apparently being recalled from memory along with a cluster of related properties, such as being prime or a power of two. Both the sequence of powers of two and the sequence of positive even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, ... are well-distinguished mental categories whose members are prototypically even. Zero belongs to neither list, hence the slower responses.\n\nRepeated experiments have shown a delay at zero for subjects with a variety of ages and national and linguistic backgrounds, confronted with number names in numeral form, spelled out, and spelled in a mirror image. Dehaene's group did find one differentiating factor: mathematical expertise. In one of their experiments, students in the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure were divided into two groups: those in literary studies and those studying mathematics, physics, or biology. The slowing at 0 was \"essentially found in the [literary] group\", and in fact, \"before the experiment, some L subjects were unsure whether 0 was odd or even and had to be reminded of the mathematical definition\".\n\nThis strong dependence on familiarity again undermines the mental calculation hypothesis. \"In some intuitive sense, the notion of parity is familiar only for numbers larger than 2. Indeed, before the experiment, some L subjects were unsure whether 0 was odd or even and had to be reminded of the mathematical definition. The evidence, in brief, suggests that instead of being calculated on the fly by using a criterion of divisibility by 2, parity information is retrieved from memory together with a number of other semantic properties ... If a semantic memory is accessed in parity judgments, then interindividual differences should be found depending on the familiarity of the subjects with number concepts.\" The effect also suggests that it is inappropriate to include zero in experiments where even and odd numbers are compared as a group. As one study puts it, \"Most researchers seem to agree that zero is not a typical even number and should not be investigated as part of the mental number line.\"\n\nEveryday contexts\nSome of the contexts where the parity of zero makes an appearance are purely rhetorical. The issue provides material for Internet message boards and ask-the-expert websites.; ;  Linguist Joseph Grimes muses that asking \"Is zero an even number?\" to married couples is a good way to get them to disagree. \"...one can pose the following questions to married couples of his acquaintance: (1) Is zero an even number? ... Many couples disagree...\" People who think that zero is neither even nor odd may use the parity of zero as proof that every rule has a counterexample, or as an example of a trick question.; \n\nAround the year 2000, media outlets noted a pair of unusual milestones: \"1999/11/19\" was the last calendar date composed of all odd digits that would occur for a very long time, and that \"2000/02/02\" was the first all-even date to occur in a very long time.; ;  Since these results make use of 0 being even, some readers disagreed with the idea. \"It follows that zero is even, and that 2/20/2000 nicely cracks the puzzle. Yet it's always surprising how much people are bothered by calling zero even...\";  \"'...according to mathematicians, the number zero, along with negative numbers and fractions, is neither even nor odd,' writes Etan...\";  \"'I agree that zero is even, but is Professor Bunder wise to 'prove' it by stating that 0 = 2 x 0? By that logic (from a PhD in mathematical logic, no less), as 0 = 1 x 0, it's also odd!' The prof will dispute this and, logically, he has a sound basis for doing so, but we may be wearing this topic a little thin ...\"\n\nIn standardized tests, if a question asks about the behavior of even numbers, it might be necessary to keep in mind that zero is even. Official publications relating to the GMAT and GRE tests both state that 0 is even.; \n\nThe parity of zero is relevant to odd\u2013even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and the other half in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even.; The quote is attributed to the heute broadcast of October 1, 1977. Arsham's account is repeated by . To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales \"Penn State mathematician George Andrews, who recalls a time of gas rationing in Australia ... Then someone in the New South Wales parliament asserted this meant plates ending in zero could never get gas, because 'zero is neither odd nor even. So the New South Wales parliament ruled that for purposes of gas rationing, zero is an even number!'\" and Maryland.A 1980 Maryland law specifies, \"(a) On even numbered calendar dates gasoline shall only be purchased by operators of vehicles bearing personalized registration plates containing no numbers and registration plates with the last digit ending in an even number. This shall not include ham radio operator plates. Zero is an even number; (b) On odd numbered calendar dates ...\" Partial quotation taken from \n\nOn U.S. Navy vessels, even-numbered compartments are found on the port side, but zero is reserved for compartments that intersect the centerline. That is, the numbers read 6-4-2-0-1-3-5 from port to starboard. In the game of roulette, the number 0 does not count as even or odd, giving the casino an advantage on such bets. Similarly, the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome depends on whether some randomized number is odd or even, and it turns out to be zero.; ; \n\nThe game of \"odds and evens\" is also affected: if both players cast zero fingers, the total number of fingers is zero, so the even player wins. One teachers' manual suggests playing this game as a way to introduce children to the concept that 0 is divisible by 2.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n External links \n\n Is Zero Even? - Numberphile, video with Dr. James Grime, University of Nottingham\n\nCategory:Elementary arithmetic\nZero\nCategory:0 (number)"}

{"title": "Primitive recursive arithmetic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_arithmetic", "text": "Primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA) is a quantifier-free formalization of the natural numbers. It was first proposed by Skolem. Reprinted in translation in . as a formalization of his finitist conception of the foundations of arithmetic, and it is widely agreed that all reasoning of PRA is finitist. Many also believe that all of finitism is captured by PRA,. but others believe finitism can be extended to forms of recursion beyond primitive recursion, up to \u03b50,. which is the proof-theoretic ordinal of Peano arithmetic.  PRA's proof theoretic ordinal is \u03c9\u03c9, where \u03c9 is the smallest transfinite ordinal.  PRA is sometimes called Skolem arithmetic.\n\nThe language of PRA can express arithmetic propositions involving natural numbers and any primitive recursive function, including the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. PRA cannot explicitly quantify over the domain of natural numbers. PRA is often taken as the basic metamathematical formal system for proof theory, in particular for consistency proofs such as Gentzen's consistency proof of first-order arithmetic.\n\n Language and axioms \nThe language of PRA consists of:\n A countably infinite number of variables x, y, z,....\nThe propositional connectives;\nThe equality symbol =, the constant symbol 0, and the successor symbol S (meaning add one);\nA symbol for each primitive recursive function.\n\nThe logical axioms of PRA are the:\n Tautologies of the propositional calculus;\n Usual axiomatization of equality as an equivalence relation.\nThe logical rules of PRA are modus ponens and variable substitution.\nThe non-logical axioms are:\n ;\n \nand recursive defining equations for every primitive recursive function as desired. For instance, the most common characterization of the primitive recursive functions is as the 0 constant and successor function closed under projection, composition and primitive recursion. So for a (n+1)-place function f defined by primitive recursion over a n-place base function g and (n+2)-place iteration function h there would be the defining equations:\n \n \nEspecially:\n \n \n \n \n ... and so on.\nPRA replaces the axiom schema of induction for first-order arithmetic with the rule of (quantifier-free) induction:\n From  and , deduce , for any predicate \n\nIn first-order arithmetic, the only primitive recursive functions that need to be explicitly axiomatized are addition and multiplication. All other primitive recursive predicates can be defined using these two primitive recursive functions and quantification over all natural numbers. Defining primitive recursive functions in this manner is not possible in PRA, because it lacks quantifiers.\n\n Logic-free calculus \nIt is possible to formalise PRA in such a way that it has no logical connectives at all\u2014a sentence of PRA is just an equation between two terms. In this setting a term is a primitive recursive function of zero or more variables. In 1941 Haskell Curry gave the first such system.. The rule of induction in Curry's system was unusual. A later refinement was given by Reuben Goodstein.. The rule of induction in Goodstein's system is:\n\nHere x is a variable, S is the successor operation, and F, G, and H are any primitive recursive functions which may have parameters other than the ones shown. The only other inference rules of Goodstein's system are substitution rules, as follows:\n\nHere A, B, and C are any terms (primitive recursive functions of zero or more variables). Finally, there are symbols for any primitive recursive functions with corresponding defining equations, as in Skolem's system above.\n\nIn this way the propositional calculus can be discarded entirely. Logical operators can be expressed entirely arithmetically, for instance, the absolute value of the difference of two numbers can be defined by primitive recursion:\n\nThus, the equations x=y and  are equivalent. Therefore the equations  and  express the logical conjunction and disjunction, respectively, of the equations x=y and u=v. Negation can be expressed as .\n\n See also \n Elementary recursive arithmetic\n Heyting arithmetic\n Peano arithmetic\n Second-order arithmetic\n Primitive recursive function\n Finite-valued logic\n\nReferences\n\nAdditional reading\n.\n\n Feferman, S (1992) What rests on what?

{"title": "Reduction (recursion theory)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_%28recursion_theory%29", "text": "In computability theory, many reducibility relations (also called reductions, reducibilities, and notions of reducibility) are studied. They are motivated by the question: given sets A and B of natural numbers, is it possible to effectively convert a method for deciding membership in B into a method for deciding membership in A?  If the answer to this question is affirmative then A is said to be reducible to B. \n\nThe study of reducibility notions is motivated by the study of decision problems. For many notions of reducibility, if any noncomputable set is reducible to a set A then A must also be noncomputable.  This gives a powerful technique for proving that many sets are noncomputable.\n\n Reducibility relations\nA reducibility relation is a binary relation on sets of natural numbers that is \n Reflexive:  Every set is reducible to itself.\n Transitive:  If a set A is reducible to a set B and B is reducible to a set C then A is reducible to C.\nThese two properties imply that a reducibility is a preorder on the powerset of the natural numbers.  Not all preorders are studied as reducibility notions, however.  The notions studied in computability theory have the informal property that A is reducible to B if and only if any (possibly noneffective) decision procedure for B can be effectively converted to a decision procedure for A. The different reducibility relations vary in the methods they permit such a conversion process to use. \n\n Degrees of a reducibility relation \n\nEvery reducibility relation (in fact, every preorder) induces an equivalence relation on the powerset of the natural numbers in which two sets are equivalent if and only if each one is reducible to the other.  In recursion theory, these equivalence classes are called the degrees of the reducibility relation.  For example, the Turing degrees are the equivalence classes of sets of naturals induced by Turing reducibility. \n\nThe degrees of any reducibility relation are partially ordered by the relation in the following manner.  Let \u2264 be a reducibility relation and let A and B be two of its degrees.  Then A \u2264 B if and only if there is a set A in A and a set B in B such that A \u2264 B.  This is equivalent to the property that for every set A in A and every set B in B, A \u2264 B, because any two sets in A are equivalent and any two sets in B are equivalent.  It is common, as shown here, to use boldface notation to denote degrees.\n\n Turing reducibility \n\nThe most fundamental reducibility notion is Turing reducibility.  A set A of natural numbers is Turing reducible to a set B if and only if there is an oracle Turing machine that, when run with B as its oracle set, will compute the indicator function (characteristic function) of A.  Equivalently, A is Turing reducible to B if and only if there is an algorithm for computing the indicator function for A provided that the algorithm is provided with a means to correctly answer questions of the form \"Is n in B?\". \n\nTuring reducibility serves as a dividing line for other reducibility notions because, according to the Church-Turing thesis, it is the most general reducibility relation that is effective.  Reducibility relations that imply Turing reducibility have come to be known as strong reducibilities, while those that are implied by Turing reducibility are weak reducibilities.   Equivalently, a strong reducibility relation is one whose degrees form a finer equivalence relation than the Turing degrees, while a weak reducibility relation is one whose degrees form a coarser equivalence relation than Turing equivalence.\n\n Reductions stronger than Turing reducibility \nThe strong reducibilities include\nOne-one reducibility: A is one-one reducible to B if there is a computable one-to-one function f with A(x) = B(f(x)) for all x.\nMany-one reducibility: A is many-one reducible to B if there is a computable function f with A(x) = B(f(x)) for all x.\nTruth-table reducible: A is truth-table reducible to B if A is Turing reducible to B via a single (oracle) Turing machine which produces a total function relative to every oracle.\nWeak truth-table reducible: A is weak truth-table reducible to B if there is a Turing reduction from B to A and a recursive function f which bounds the use. Whenever A is truth-table reducible to B, A is also weak truth-table reducible to B, since one can construct a recursive bound on the use by considering the maximum use over the tree of all oracles, which will exist if the reduction is total on all oracles.\nPositive reducible: A is positive reducible to B if and only if A is truth-table reducible to B in a way that one can compute for every x a formula consisting of atoms of the form B(0), B(1), ... such that these atoms are combined by and's and or's, where the and of a and b is 1 if a = 1 and b = 1 and so on.\nDisjunctive reducible: Similar to positive reducible with the additional constraint that only or's are permitted.\nConjunctive reducibility: Similar to positive reducibility with the additional constraint that only and's are permitted.\nLinear reducibility: Similar to positive reducibility but with the constraint that all atoms of the form B(n) are combined by exclusive or's. In other words, A is linear reducible to B if and only if a computable function computes for each x a finite set F(x) given as an explicit list of numbers such that x \u2208 A if and only if F(x) contains an odd number of elements of B.\nMany of these were introduced by Post (1944). Post was searching for a non-recursive, recursively enumerable set which the halting problem could not be Turing reduced to. As he could not construct such a set in 1944, he instead worked on the analogous problems for the various reducibilities that he introduced. These reducibilities have since been the subject of much research, and many relationships between them are known.  \n\n Bounded reducibilities \nA bounded form of each of the above strong reducibilities can be defined. The most famous of these is bounded truth-table reduction, but there are also bounded Turing, bounded weak truth-table and others. These first three are the most common ones and they are based on the number of queries. For example, a set A is bounded truth-table reducible to B if and only if the Turing machine M computing A relative to B computes a list of up to n numbers, queries B on these numbers and then terminates for all possible oracle answers; the value n is a constant independent of x. The difference between bounded weak truth-table and bounded Turing reduction is that in the first case, the up to n queries have to be made at the same time while in the second case, the queries can be made one after the other. For that reason, there are cases where A is bounded Turing reducible to B but not weak truth-table reducible to B.\n\n Strong reductions in computational complexity \n\nThe strong reductions listed above restrict the manner in which oracle information can be accessed by a decision procedure but do not otherwise limit the computational resources available.  Thus if a set A is decidable then A is reducible to any set B under any of the strong reducibility relations listed above, even if A is not polynomial-time or exponential-time decidable.   This is acceptable in the study of recursion theory, which is interested in theoretical computability, but it is not reasonable for computational complexity theory, which studies which sets can be decided under certain asymptotical resource bounds.  \n\nThe most common reducibility in computational complexity theory is polynomial-time reducibility; a set A is polynomial-time reducible to a set B if there is a polynomial-time function f such that for every n, n is in A if and only if f(n) is in B.  This reducibility is, essentially, a resource-bounded version of many-one reducibility.  Other resource-bounded reducibilities are used in other contexts of computational complexity theory where other resource bounds are of interest.\n\n Reductions weaker than Turing reducibility \nAlthough Turing reducibility is the most general reducibility that is effective, weaker reducibility relations are commonly studied.  These reducibilities are related to relative definability of sets over arithmetic or set theory. They include:\n Arithmetical reducibility: A set A is arithmetical in a set B if A is definable over the standard model of Peano arithmetic with an extra predicate for B.   Equivalently, according to Post's theorem, A is arithmetical in B if and only if A is Turing reducible to , the nth Turing jump of B, for some natural number n. The arithmetical hierarchy gives a finer classification of arithmetical reducibility. \n Hyperarithmetical reducibility:  A set A is hyperarithmetical in a set B if A is  definable (see analytical hierarchy) over the standard model of Peano arithmetic with a predicate for B.  Equivalently, A is hyperarithmetical in B if and only if A is Turing reducible to , the \u03b1th Turing jump of B, for some B-recursive ordinal \u03b1. \nRelative constructibility: A set A is relatively constructible from a set B if A is in L(B), the smallest transitive model of ZFC set theory containing B and all the ordinals.\n\n References \n K.

{"title": "Relation algebra", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_algebra", "text": "In mathematics and abstract algebra, a relation algebra is a residuated Boolean algebra expanded with an involution called converse, a unary operation. The motivating example of a relation algebra is the algebra 2X\u00b2 of all binary relations on a set X, that is, subsets of the cartesian square X2, with R\u2022S interpreted as the usual composition of binary relations R and S, and with the converse of R as the converse relation.\n\nRelation algebra emerged in the 19th-century work of Augustus De Morgan and Charles Peirce, which culminated in the algebraic logic of Ernst Schr\u00f6der. The equational form of relation algebra treated here was developed by Alfred Tarski and his students, starting in the 1940s. Tarski and Givant (1987) applied relation algebra to a variable-free treatment of axiomatic set theory, with the implication that mathematics founded on set theory could itself be conducted without variables.\n\nDefinition\nA relation algebra (L, \u2227, \u2228, \u2212, 0, 1, \u2022, I, \u02d8) is an algebraic structure equipped with the Boolean operations of conjunction x\u2227y, disjunction x\u2228y, and negation x\u2212, the Boolean constants 0 and 1, the relational operations of composition x\u2022y and converse x\u02d8, and the relational constant I, such that these operations and constants satisfy certain equations constituting an axiomatization of a calculus of relations. Roughly, a relation algebra is to a system of binary relations on a set containing the empty (0), complete (1), and identity (I) relations and closed under these five operations as a group is to a system of permutations of a set containing the identity permutation and closed under composition and inverse. However, the first order theory of relation algebras is not complete for such systems of binary relations.\n\nFollowing J\u00f3nsson and Tsinakis (1993) it is convenient to define additional operations x\u25c1y = x\u2022y\u02d8, and, dually,  x\u25b7y = x\u02d8\u2022y .  J\u00f3nsson and Tsinakis showed that I\u25c1x = x\u25b7I, and that both were equal to x\u02d8.  Hence a relation algebra can equally well be defined as an algebraic structure (L, \u2227, \u2228, \u2212, 0, 1, \u2022, I, \u25c1, \u25b7).  The advantage of this signature over the usual one is that a relation algebra can then be defined in full simply as a residuated Boolean algebra for which I\u25c1x is an involution, that is, I\u25c1(I\u25c1x) = x .  The latter condition can be thought of as the relational counterpart of the equation 1/(1/x) = x for ordinary arithmetic reciprocal, and some authors use reciprocal as a synonym for converse.\n\nSince residuated Boolean algebras are axiomatized with finitely many identities, so are relation algebras. Hence the latter form a variety, the variety RA of relation algebras.  Expanding the above definition as equations yields the following finite axiomatization.\n\nAxioms\nThe axioms B1-B10 below are adapted from Givant (2006: 283), and were first set out by Tarski in 1948.Alfred Tarski (1948) \"Abstract: Representation Problems for Relation Algebras,\" Bulletin of the AMS 54: 80.\n\nL is a Boolean algebra under binary disjunction, \u2228, and unary complementation ()\u2212:\nB1: A \u2228 B = B \u2228 A\nB2: A \u2228 (B \u2228 C) = (A \u2228 B) \u2228 C\nB3: (A\u2212 \u2228 B)\u2212 \u2228 (A\u2212 \u2228 B\u2212)\u2212 = A\nThis axiomatization of Boolean algebra is due to Huntington (1933).  Note that the meet of the implied Boolean algebra is not the \u2022 operator (even though it distributes over  like a meet does), nor is the 1 of the Boolean algebra the I constant.\n\nL is a monoid under binary composition (\u2022) and nullary identity I:\nB4: A\u2022(B\u2022C) = (A\u2022B)\u2022C\nB5: A\u2022I = A\n\nUnary converse ()\u02d8 is an involution with respect to composition:\nB6: A\u02d8\u02d8 = A \nB7: (A\u2022B)\u02d8 = B\u02d8\u2022A\u02d8\n\nAxiom B6 defines conversion as an involution, whereas B7 expresses the antidistributive property of conversion relative to composition.\n\nConverse and composition distribute over disjunction:\nB8: (A\u2228B)\u02d8 = A\u02d8\u2228B\u02d8\nB9: (A\u2228B)\u2022C = (A\u2022C)\u2228(B\u2022C)\n\nB10 is Tarski's equational form of the fact, discovered by Augustus De Morgan, that A\u2022B \u2264 C\u2212   A\u02d8\u2022C \u2264 B\u2212   C\u2022B\u02d8 \u2264 A\u2212.\nB10: (A\u02d8\u2022(A\u2022B)\u2212)\u2228B\u2212 = B\u2212\n\nThese axioms are ZFC theorems; for the purely Boolean B1-B3, this fact is trivial. After each of the following axioms is shown the number of the corresponding theorem in Chapter 3 of Suppes (1960), an exposition of ZFC: B4 27, B5 45, B6 14, B7 26, B8 16, B9 23.\n\nExpressing properties of binary relations in RA\nThe following table shows how many of the usual properties of binary relations can be expressed as succinct RA equalities or inequalities. Below, an inequality of the form A\u2264B is shorthand for the Boolean equation A\u2228B = B.\n\nThe most complete set of results of this nature is Chapter C of Carnap (1958), where the notation is rather distant from that of this entry. Chapter  3.2 of Suppes (1960) contains fewer results, presented as ZFC theorems and using a notation that more resembles that of this entry. Neither Carnap nor Suppes formulated their results using the RA of this entry, or in an equational manner.\nR isIf and only if:FunctionalR\u02d8\u2022R \u2264 I  Left-totalI \u2264 R\u2022R\u02d8 (R\u02d8 is surjective)Functionfunctional and left-total.Injective R\u2022R\u02d8 \u2264 I (R\u02d8 is functional) Surjective I \u2264 R\u02d8\u2022R (R\u02d8 is left-total)Bijection R\u02d8\u2022R = R\u2022R\u02d8 = I (Injective surjective function)TransitiveR\u2022R \u2264 RReflexiveI \u2264 RCoreflexiveR \u2264 IIrreflexiveR \u2227 I = 0SymmetricR\u02d8 = RAntisymmetricR \u2227 R\u02d8 \u2264 IAsymmetricR \u2227 R\u02d8 = 0Total R \u2228 R\u02d8 = 1 Connex I \u2228 R \u2228 R\u02d8 = 1 IdempotentR\u2022R = R Preorder R is transitive and reflexive.EquivalenceR is a symmetric preorder.Partial order R is an antisymmetric preorder.Total order R is a total partial order.Strict partial orderR is transitive and irreflexive.Strict total order R is a connex strict partial order.Dense R \u2227 I\u2212 \u2264 (R \u2227 I\u2212)\u2022(R \u2227 I\u2212).\n\nExpressive power\nThe metamathematics of RA are discussed at length in Tarski and Givant (1987), and more briefly in Givant (2006).\n\nRA consists entirely of equations manipulated using nothing more than uniform replacement and the substitution of equals for equals. Both rules are wholly familiar from school mathematics and from abstract algebra generally. Hence RA proofs are carried out in a manner familiar to all mathematicians, unlike the case in mathematical logic generally.\n\nRA can express any (and up to logical equivalence, exactly the) first-order logic (FOL) formulas containing no more than three variables. (A given variable can be quantified multiple times and hence quantifiers can be nested arbitrarily deeply by \"reusing\" variables.) Surprisingly, this fragment of FOL suffices to express Peano arithmetic and almost all axiomatic set theories ever proposed. Hence RA is, in effect, a way of algebraizing nearly all mathematics, while dispensing with FOL and its connectives, quantifiers, turnstiles, and modus ponens. Because RA can express Peano arithmetic and set theory, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems apply to it; RA is incomplete, incompletable, and undecidable. (N.B. The Boolean algebra fragment of RA is complete and decidable.)\n\nThe representable relation algebras, forming the class RRA, are those relation algebras isomorphic to some relation algebra consisting of binary relations on some set, and closed under the intended interpretation of the RA operations. It is easily shown, e.g. using the method of pseudoelementary classes, that RRA is a quasivariety, that is, axiomatizable by a universal Horn theory. In 1950, Roger Lyndon proved the existence of equations holding in RRA that did not hold in RA. Hence the variety generated by RRA is a proper subvariety of the variety RA. In 1955, Alfred Tarski showed that RRA is itself a variety. In 1964, Donald Monk showed that RRA has no finite axiomatization, unlike RA, which is finitely axiomatized by definition.\n\nQ-relation algebras\nAn RA is a Q-relation algebra (QRA) if, in addition to B1-B10, there exist some A and B such that (Tarski and Givant 1987: \u00a78.4):\n\nQ0: A\u02d8\u2022A \u2264 I\nQ1: B\u02d8\u2022B \u2264 I\nQ2: A\u02d8\u2022B = 1\n\nEssentially these axioms imply that the universe has a (non-surjective) pairing relation whose projections are A and B. It is a theorem that every QRA is a RRA (Proof by Maddux, see Tarski & Givant 1987: 8.4(iii) ).\n\nEvery QRA is representable (Tarski and Givant 1987). That not every relation algebra is representable is a fundamental way RA differs from QRA and Boolean algebras, which, by Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras, are always representable as sets of subsets of some set, closed under union, intersection, and complement.\n\n Examples \n1.  Any Boolean algebra can be turned into a RA by interpreting conjunction as composition (the monoid multiplication \u2022), i.e. x\u2022y is defined as x\u2227y.  This interpretation requires that converse interpret identity (\u045e = y), and that both residuals y\\x and x/y interpret the conditional y\u2192x  (i.e., \u00acy\u2228x).\n\n2.  The motivating example of a relation algebra depends on the definition of a binary relation R on a set X as any subset R \u2286 X\u00b2, where  X\u00b2 is the Cartesian square of X. The power set 2X\u00b2 consisting of all binary relations on X is a Boolean algebra. While  2X\u00b2 can be made a relation algebra by taking R\u2022S = R\u2227S, as per example (1) above, the standard interpretation of \u2022 is instead x(R\u2022S)z = \u2203y:xRy.ySz.  That is, the ordered pair (x,z) belongs to the relation R\u2022S just when there exists y \u2208 X such that (x,y) \u2208 R and (y,z) \u2208 S. This interpretation uniquely determines R\\S as consisting of all pairs (y,z) such that for all x \u2208 X, if xRy then xSz. Dually, S/R consists of all pairs (x,y) such that for all z \u2208 X, if yRz then xSz. The translation \u045e = \u00ac(y\\\u00acI) then establishes the converse R\u02d8 of R as consisting of all pairs (y,x) such that (x,y) \u2208 R.\n\n3.  An important generalization of the previous example is the power set 2E where E \u2286 X\u00b2 is any equivalence relation on the set X. This is a generalization because X\u00b2 is itself an equivalence relation, namely the complete relation consisting of all pairs. While 2E is not a subalgebra of 2X\u00b2 when E \u2260 X\u00b2 (since in that case it does not contain the relation X\u00b2, the top element 1 being E instead of X\u00b2), it is nevertheless turned into a relation algebra using the same definitions of the operations. Its importance resides in the definition of a representable relation algebra as any relation algebra isomorphic to a subalgebra of the relation algebra 2E for some equivalence relation E on some set. The previous section says more about the relevant metamathematics.\n\n4. Let  be group. Then the power set  is a relation algebra with the obvious boolean algebra operations, composition given by the product of group subsets, the converse by the inverse subset (), and the identity by the singleton subset . There is a relation algebra homomorphism embedding  in  which sends each subset  to the relation\n. The image of this homomorphism is the set of all right-invariant relations on . \n\n5. If group sum or product interprets composition, group inverse interprets converse, group identity interprets I, and if R is a one-to-one correspondence, so that R\u02d8\u2022R = R\u2022R\u02d8 = I,Tarski, A. (1941), p. 87. then L is a group as well as a monoid. B4-B7 become well-known theorems of group theory, so that RA becomes a proper extension of group theory as well as of Boolean algebra.\n\nHistorical remarks\nDe Morgan founded RA in 1860, but C. S. Peirce took it much further and became fascinated with its philosophical power. The work of DeMorgan and Peirce came to be known mainly in the extended and definitive form Ernst Schr\u00f6der gave it in Vol. 3 of his Vorlesungen (1890\u20131905). Principia Mathematica drew strongly on Schr\u00f6der's RA, but acknowledged him only as the inventor of the notation. In 1912, Alwin Korselt proved that a particular formula in which the quantifiers were nested four deep had no RA equivalent.Korselt did not publish his finding. It was first published in Leopold Loewenheim (1915) \"\u00dcber M\u00f6glichkeiten im Relativkalk\u00fcl,\" Mathematische Annalen 76: 447\u2013470.

It contrasts with the fast-growing hierarchy.\n\n Definition \nLet \u03bc be a large countable ordinal such that a fundamental sequence is assigned to every limit ordinal less than \u03bc.  The slow-growing hierarchy of functions g\u03b1: N \u2192 N, for \u03b1 < \u03bc, is then defined as follows:\n\n for limit ordinal \u03b1.\n\nHere \u03b1[n] denotes the nth element of the fundamental sequence assigned to the limit ordinal \u03b1.\n\nThe article on the Fast-growing hierarchy describes a standardized choice for fundamental sequence for all \u03b1 < \u03b50.\n\n Relation to fast-growing hierarchy \nThe slow-growing hierarchy grows much more slowly than the fast-growing hierarchy. Even g\u03b50 is only equivalent to f3 and g\u03b1 only attains the growth of f\u03b50 (the first function that Peano arithmetic cannot prove total in the hierarchy) when \u03b1 is the Bachmann\u2013Howard ordinal.\n\nHowever, Girard proved that the slow-growing hierarchy eventually catches up with the fast-growing one. Specifically, that there exists an ordinal \u03b1 such that for all integers n\ng\u03b1(n) < f\u03b1(n) < g\u03b1(n + 1)\nwhere f\u03b1 are the functions in the fast-growing hierarchy. He further showed that the first \u03b1 this holds for is the ordinal of the theory ID<\u03c9 of arbitrary finite iterations of an inductive definition. However, for the assignment of fundamental sequences found in  the first match up occurs at the level \u03b50. For Buchholz style tree ordinals it could be shown that the first match up even occurs at .\n\nExtensions of the result proved to considerably larger ordinals show that there are very few ordinals below the ordinal of transfinitely iterated -comprehension where the slow- and fast-growing hierarchy match up.\n\nThe slow-growing hierarchy depends extremely sensitively on the choice of the underlying fundamental sequences.Weiermann, A.

Holbrook: \"Space-filling curves\", Springer-Verlag, New York, 1994 but have a branching, tree-like structure and are rooted.  A space-filling tree is defined by an incremental process that results in a tree for which every point in the space has a finite-length path that converges to it. In contrast to space-filling curves, individual paths in the tree are short, allowing any part of the space to be quickly reached from the root.\nKuffner, J. J. and S. M.

Space-filling trees have interesting parallels in nature, including fluid distribution systems, vascular networks, and fractal plant growth, and many interesting connections to L-systems in computer science.\n\nDefinition\n\nA space-filling tree is defined by an iterative process whereby a single point in a continuous space is connected via a continuous path to every other point in the space by a path of finite length, and for every point in the space, there is at least one path that converges to it.\n\nThe term \"space-filling tree\" in this sense was created in a 2009 tech report Kuffner, J. J. and S. M. LaValle: Space-filling Trees, The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, CMU-RI-TR-09-47, 2009. that defines \"space-filling\" and \"tree\" differently than their traditional definitions in mathematics.  As explained in the space-filling curve article, in 1890, Peano found the first space-filling curve, and by Jordan's 1887 definition, which is now standard, a curve is a single function, not a sequence of functions.  The curve is \"space filling\" because it is \"a curve whose range contains the entire 2-dimensional unit square\" (as explained in the first sentence of space-filling curve).\n\nIn contrast, a space-filling tree, as defined in the tech report, is not a single tree. It is only a sequence of trees. The paper says \"A space-filling tree is actually defined as an infinite sequence of trees\". It defines  as a \"sequence of trees\", then states \" is a space-filling tree\".  It is not space-filling in the standard sense of including the entire 2-dimensional unit square.  Instead, the paper defines it as having trees in the sequence coming arbitrarily close to every point.  It states \"A tree sequence T is called 'space filling' in a space X if for every x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0X, there exists a path in the tree that starts at the root and converges to\u00a0x.\".  The standard term for this concept is that it includes a set of points that is  dense everywhere in the unit square.\n\nExamples\nThe simplest example of a space-filling tree is one that fills a square planar region. The images illustrate the construction for the planar region . At each iteration, additional branches are added to the existing trees.\n\nSpace-filling trees can also be defined for a variety of other shapes and volumes.\nBelow is the subdivision scheme used to define a space-filling for a triangular region.\nAt each iteration, additional branches are added to the existing trees connecting the center of each triangle to the centers of the four subtriangles.\n\nThe first six iterations of the triangle space-filling tree are illustrated below:\n\nSpace-filling trees can also be constructed in higher dimensions.  The simplest examples are cubes in  and hypercubes in .\nA similar sequence of iterations used for the square space-filling tree can be used for hypercubes.

{"title": "Syntax (logic)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_%28logic%29", "text": "thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the syntactic entities which may be constructed from formal languages.Dictionary Definition The symbols and strings of symbols may be broadly divided into nonsense and well-formed formulas. A formal language is identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems.\n\nIn logic, syntax is anything having to do with formal languages or formal systems without regard to any interpretation or meaning given to them. Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing, or transforming the symbols and words of a language, as contrasted with the semantics of a language which is concerned with its meaning.\n\nThe symbols, formulas, systems, theorems, proofs, and interpretations expressed in formal languages are syntactic entities whose properties may be studied without regard to any meaning they may be given, and, in fact, need not be given any.\n\nSyntax is usually associated with the rules (or grammar) governing the composition of texts in a formal language that constitute the well-formed formulas of a formal system.\n\nIn computer science, the term syntax refers to the rules governing the composition of well-formed expressions in a programming language. As in mathematical logic, it is independent of semantics and interpretation.\n\n Syntactic entities \n Symbols \n\nA symbol is an idea, abstraction or concept, tokens of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols of anything. For instance there are logical constants which do not refer to any idea, but rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). A symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well-formed formula if the formulation is consistent with the formation rules of the language. Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any interpretation of them.\n\n Formal language \n\nA formal language is a syntactic entity which consists of a set of finite strings of symbols which are its words (usually called its well-formed formulas). Which strings of symbols are words is determined by the creator of the language, usually by specifying a set of formation rules. Such a language can be defined without reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it \u2013 that is, before it has any meaning.\n\n Formation rules \n\nFormation rules are a precise description of which strings of symbols are the well-formed formulas of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of strings over the alphabet of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their semantics (i.e. what they mean).\n\n Propositions \n\nA proposition is a sentence expressing something true or false. A proposition is identified ontologically as an idea, concept or abstraction whose token instances are patterns of symbols, marks, sounds, or strings of words.Metalogic, Geoffrey Hunter Propositions are considered to be syntactic entities and also truthbearers.\n\n Formal theories \n\nA formal theory is a set of sentences in a formal language.\n\n Formal systems \n\nA formal system (also called a logical calculus, or a logical system) consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a deductive system). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called inference rules) or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. Formal systems, like other syntactic entities may be defined without any interpretation given to it (as being, for instance, a system of arithmetic).\n\n Syntactic consequence within a formal system \n\nA formula A is a syntactic consequence within some formal system  of a set \u0413 of formulas if there is a derivation in formal system  of A from the set \u0413.\n\nSyntactic consequence does not depend on any interpretation of the formal system.Hunter, Geoffrey, Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic, University of California Pres, 1971, p. 75.\n\n Syntactic completeness of a formal system \n\nA formal system  is syntactically complete (also deductively complete, maximally complete, negation complete or simply complete) iff for each formula A of the language of the system either A or \u00acA is a theorem of . In another sense, a formal system is syntactically complete iff no unprovable axiom can be added to it as an axiom without introducing an inconsistency. Truth-functional propositional logic and first-order predicate logic are semantically complete, but not syntactically complete (for example the propositional logic statement consisting of a single variable \"a\" is not a theorem, and neither is its negation, but these are not tautologies). G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem shows that no recursive system that is sufficiently powerful, such as the Peano axioms, can be both consistent and complete.\n\n Interpretations \n\nAn interpretation of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and truth values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called formal semantics. Giving an interpretation is synonymous with constructing a model. An interpretation is expressed in a metalanguage, which may itself be a formal language, and as such itself is a syntactic entity.\n\nSee also\nSymbol (formal)\nFormation rule\nFormal grammar\nSyntax (linguistics)\nSyntax (programming languages)\nMathematical logic\nWell-formed formula\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \nCategory:Formal languages\nCategory:Metalogic\nCategory:Concepts in logic\nCategory:Philosophy of logic"}
{"title": "Triviality (mathematics)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triviality_%28mathematics%29", "text": "In mathematics, the adjective trivial is frequently used for objects (for example, groups or topological spaces) that have a very simple structure. The noun triviality usually refers to a simple technical aspect of some proof or definition. The origin of the term in mathematical language comes from the medieval trivium curriculum. The antonym nontrivial is commonly used by mathematicians to indicate a statement or theorem that is not obvious or easy to prove.\n\nTrivial and nontrivial solutions\nIn mathematics, the term trivial is frequently used for objects (for examples, groups or topological spaces) that have a very simple structure.\n\nExamples  are as follows:\nempty set: the set containing no or null members.\ntrivial group: the mathematical group containing only the identity element.\ntrivial ring: a ring defined on a singleton set.\nTrivial can also be used to describe solutions to an equation that have a very simple structure, but for the sake of completeness cannot be omitted. These solutions are called the trivial solutions.  For example, consider the differential equation\n\nwhere y = f(x) is a function whose derivative is y\u2032. The trivial solution is\n, the zero function\nwhile a nontrivial solution is\n, the exponential function.\n\nThe differential equation  with boundary conditions  is important in math and physics, for example describing a particle in a box in quantum mechanics, or standing waves on a string. It always has the solution . This solution is considered obvious and is called the \"trivial\" solution. In some cases, there may be other solutions (sinusoids), which are called \"nontrivial\".Introduction to partial differential equations with applications, by Zachmanoglou and Thoe, p309\n\nSimilarly, mathematicians often describe  Fermat's Last Theorem as asserting that there are no nontrivial integer solutions to the equation  when n is greater than 2.  Clearly, there are some solutions to the equation.  For example,  is a solution for any n, but such solutions are all obvious and uninteresting, and hence \"trivial\".\n\nIn mathematical reasoning\nTrivial may also refer to any easy case of a proof, which for the sake of completeness cannot be ignored.  For instance, proofs by mathematical induction have two parts: the \"base case\" that shows that the theorem is true for a particular initial value such as n = 0 or n = 1 and then an inductive step that shows that if the theorem is true for a certain value of n, it is also true for the value n + 1.  The base case is often trivial and is identified as such, although there are situations where the base case is difficult but the inductive step is trivial. Similarly, one might want to prove that some property is possessed by all the members of a certain set.  The main part of the proof will consider the case of a nonempty set, and examine the members in detail; in the case where the set is empty, the property is trivially possessed by all the members, since there are none.  (See also Vacuous truth.)\n\nA common joke in the mathematical community is to say that \"trivial\" is synonymous with \"proved\"\u2014that is, any theorem can be considered \"trivial\" once it is known to be true.  Another joke concerns two mathematicians who are discussing a theorem; the first mathematician says that the theorem is \"trivial\".  In response to the other's request for an explanation, he then proceeds with twenty minutes of exposition.  At the end of the explanation, the second mathematician agrees that the theorem is trivial.  These jokes point out the subjectivity of judgments about triviality.  The joke also applies when the first mathematician says the theorem is trivial, but is unable to prove it himself. Often, as a joke, the theorem is then referred to as \"intuitively obvious\".  Someone experienced in calculus, for example, would consider the statement that\n to be trivial. To a beginning student of calculus, though, this may not be obvious at all.\n\nTriviality also depends on context. A proof in functional analysis would probably, given a number, trivially assume the existence of a larger number. When proving basic results about the natural numbers in elementary number theory though, the proof may very well hinge on the remark that any natural number has a successor (which should then in itself be proved or taken as an axiom, see Peano's axioms).\n\n Trivial proofs \nIn some texts, a trivial proof refers to a statement involving a material implication where the consequent, or Q, in P\u2192Q, is always true.   Here, the proof follows simply from noting that Q is always true, as the implication is then true regardless of the truth value of the antecedent, P.\n\nA related concept is a vacuous truth, where the antecedent, P, in the material implication P\u2192Q is always false.  Here, the implication is always true regardless of the truth value of the consequent, Q.\n\n Examples \nIn number theory, it is often important to find factors of an integer number N. Any number N has four obvious factors: \u00b11 and \u00b1N. These are called \"trivial factors\". Any other factor, if any exist, would be called \"nontrivial\".Number theory for computing, by Song Y. Yan, p250\nThe matrix equation , where  is a fixed matrix,  is an unknown vector, and  is the zero vector, has an obvious solution . This is called the \"trivial solution\". If it has other solutions , they would be called \"nontrivial\"Mathematics for engineers and scientists, by Alan Jeffrey, p502\nIn the mathematics of group theory, there is a very simple group with just one element in it; this is often called the \"trivial group\". All other groups, which are more complicated, are called \"nontrivial\".\nIn graph theory the trivial graph is a graph which has only 1 vertex and no edges.\nDatabase theory has a concept called functional dependency, written . The dependence  is true if Y is a subset of X, so this type of dependence is called \"trivial\". All other dependences, which are less obvious, are called \"nontrivial\".\n It can be shown that Riemann's zeta function has zeros at the negative even numbers -2, -4, ... Though the proof is comparatively easy, this result would still not normally be called trivial; however, it is in this case, for its other zeros are not generally known and have important applications and involve open questions (such as the Riemann hypothesis); and so, the negative even numbers are called the trivial zeros, and any other zeros are called non-trivial.\n\n See also \n Degeneracy\n Initial and terminal objects\n Pathological\n Trivialism\n\n References \n\nExternal links\n\nTrivial entry at MathWorld\n\nCategory:Mathematical terminology"}

{"title": "Turing reduction", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction", "text": "In computability theory, a Turing reduction (also known as a Cook reduction) from a problem A to a problem B, is a reduction which solves A, assuming the solution to B is already known (Rogers 1967, Soare 1987). It can be understood as an algorithm that could be used to solve A if it had available to it a subroutine for solving B. More formally, a Turing reduction is a function computable by an oracle machine with an oracle for B.  Turing reductions can be applied to both decision problems and function problems.\n\nIf a Turing reduction of A to B exists then every algorithm for B can be used to produce an algorithm for A, by inserting the algorithm for B at each place where the oracle machine computing A queries the oracle for B. However, because the oracle machine may query the oracle a large number of times, the resulting algorithm may require more time asymptotically than either the algorithm for B or the oracle machine computing A, and may require as much space as both together.\n\nThe first formal definition of relative computability, then called relative reducibility, was given by Alan Turing in 1939 in terms of oracle machines. Later in 1943 and 1952 Stephen Kleene defined an equivalent concept in terms of recursive functions. In 1944 Emil Post used the term \"Turing reducibility\" to refer to the concept.\n\nA polynomial-time Turing reduction is known as a Cook reduction, after Stephen Cook.\n\n Definition \n\nGiven two sets  of natural numbers, we say  is Turing reducible to  and write\n\nif there is an oracle machine that computes the characteristic function of A when run with oracle B.  In this case, we also say A is B-recursive and B-computable.\n\nIf there is an oracle machine that, when run with oracle B,  computes a partial function with domain A, then A is said to be B-recursively enumerable and B-computably enumerable.\n\nWe say  is Turing equivalent to  and write  if both   and  The equivalence classes of Turing equivalent sets are called Turing degrees. The Turing degree of a set  is written .\n\nGiven a set , a set  is called Turing hard for  if   for all . If additionally  then  is called Turing complete for .\n\nRelation of Turing completeness to computational universality\nTuring completeness, as just defined above, corresponds only partially to Turing completeness in the sense of computational universality.  Specifically, a Turing machine is a universal Turing machine if its halting problem (i.e., the set of inputs for which it eventually halts) is many-one complete.  Thus, a necessary but insufficient condition for a machine to be computationally universal, is that the machine's halting problem be Turing-complete for the set  of recursively enumerable sets.\n\n Example \n\nLet  denote the set of input values for which the Turing machine with index e halts.  Then the sets  and  are Turing equivalent (here  denotes an effective pairing function).  A reduction showing  can be constructed using the fact that .  Given a pair , a new index  can be constructed using the smn theorem such that the program coded by  ignores its input and merely simulates the computation of the machine with index e on input n.  \nIn particular, the machine with index  either halts on every input or halts on no input.  Thus  holds for all e and n.  Because the function i is computable, this shows .  The reductions presented here are not only Turing reductions but many-one reductions, discussed below.\n\n Properties \n\n Every set is Turing equivalent to its complement\n Every computable set is Turing reducible to every other set.  Because any computable set can be computed with no oracle, it can be computed by an oracle machine that ignores the given oracle.\n The relation  is transitive: if  and  then .  Moreover,  holds for every set A, and thus the relation  is a preorder (it is not a partial order because  and  does not necessarily imply ).\n There are pairs of sets   such that A is not Turing reducible to B and B is not Turing reducible to A.  Thus  is not a linear order.\n There are infinite decreasing sequences of sets under . Thus this relation is not well-founded.\n Every set is Turing reducible to its own Turing jump, but the Turing jump of a set is never Turing reducible to the original set.\n\n The use of a reduction \n\nSince every reduction from a set B to a set A has to determine whether a single element is in A in only finitely many steps, it can only make finitely many queries of membership in the set B. When the amount of information about the set B used to compute a single bit of A is discussed, this is made precise by the use function. Formally, the use of a reduction is the function that sends each natural number n to the largest natural number m whose membership in the set B was queried by the reduction while determining the membership of n in A.\n\n Stronger reductions \n\nThere are two common ways of producing reductions stronger than Turing reducibility.  \nThe first way is to limit the number and manner of oracle queries.  \n A set A is many-one reducible to B if there is a total computable function f such that an element n is in A if and only if f(n) is in B.  Such a function can be used to generate a Turing reduction (by computing f(n), querying the oracle, and then interpreting the result).\n A truth table reduction or a weak truth table reduction must present all of its oracle queries at the same time. In a truth table reduction, the reduction also gives a boolean function (a truth table) which, when given the answers to the queries, will produce the final answer of the reduction. In a weak truth table reduction, the reduction uses the oracle answers as a basis for further computation depending on the given answers (but not using the oracle). Equivalently, a weak truth table reduction is one for which the use of the reduction is bounded by a computable function. For this reason, weak truth table reductions are sometimes called \"bounded Turing\" reductions.\n\nThe second way to produce a stronger reducibility notion is to limit the computational resources that the program implementing the Turing reduction may use.   These limits on the computational complexity of the reduction are important when studying subrecursive classes such as P.  A set A is polynomial-time reducible to a set B if there is a Turing reduction of A to B that runs in polynomial time.  The concept of log-space reduction is similar.\n\nThese reductions are stronger in the sense that they provide a finer distinction into equivalence classes, and satisfy more restrictive requirements than Turing reductions.  Consequently, such reductions are harder to find.  There may be no way to build a many-one reduction from one set to another even when a Turing reduction for the same sets exists.\n\n Weaker reductions \n\nAccording to the Church\u2013Turing thesis, a Turing reduction is the most general form of an effectively calculable reduction.  Nevertheless, weaker reductions are also considered.  A set A is said to be arithmetical in B if A is definable by a formula of Peano arithmetic with B as a parameter.  The set A is hyperarithmetical in B  if there is a recursive ordinal \u03b1 such that A is computable from , the \u03b1-iterated Turing jump of B.  The notion of relative constructibility is an important reducibility notion in set theory.\n\n See also \n Karp reduction\n\n References \n\n M. Davis, ed., 1965.

{"title": "University of Turin", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Turin", "text": "right|235px|thumb|Hall of the Rectorate Palace of the University of Turin\nThe University of Turin (Italian: Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Torino, or often abbreviated to UNITO) is a university in the city of Turin in the Piedmont region of north-western Italy.  It is one of the oldest universities in Europe (one of the oldest in history), and continues to play an important role in research and training. It is steadily ranked among the top 5 Italian universities and it is ranked third for research activities in Italy, according to the latest data by ANVUR.\n\n History \n\n Overview \n\nThe University of Turin was founded as a studium in 1404, under the initiative of Prince Ludovico di Savoia. From 1427 to 1436 the seat of the university was transferred to Chieri and Savigliano. It was closed in 1536, and reestablished by Duke Emmanuel Philibert thirty years later. It started to gain its modern shape following the model of the University of Bologna, although significant development did not occur until the reforms made by Victor Amadeus II, who also created the Collegio delle Province for students not natives of Turin.\n\nWith the reforms carried out by Victor Amadeus II, the University of Turin became a new reference model for many other universities. During the 18th century, the University faced an enormous growth in faculty and endowment size, becoming a point of reference of the Italian Positivism. Notable scholars of this period include Cesare Lombroso, Carlo Forlanini and Arturo Graf.\n\nIn the 20th century, the University of Turin was one of the centers of the Italian anti-fascism. After the post-war period, the increase in the number of students and the improvement of campus structure were imposing, although losing some of its importance until a new wave of investments carried out in the end of that century. The new impulse was performed in collaboration with other national and international research centers, as well as with local organizations and the Italian Minister of Public Instruction.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, the local campuses of Alessandria, Novara and Vercelli became autonomous units under the new University of Eastern Piedmont.\n\n Early years (1404\u20131566) \n\nIn the beginning of the 15th century, instability in the Lombard region caused by the political and military crisis, coupled with the untimely death of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, induced the teaching staff of the Universities of Pavia and Piacenza to propose to Ludovico di Savoia-Acaia the creation of a new Studium generale.\n\nChoice of the location fell on Turin for a number of reasons: first it was at the crossroads between the Alps, Liguria and Lombardy; it was also an episcopal seat and in addition the Savoy Prince was willing to establish a university on his own land, like those in other parts of Italy. In autumn 1404, a bull issued by Benedict XIII, the Avignon Pope, marked the actual birth of a centre of higher learning, formally ratified in 1412 by the Emperor Sigmund's certification and subsequently, in 1413, by a bull issued by antipope John XXIII, the Pisan Pope, and probably by another issued in 1419 by Martin V, Pope of Rome, and by a series of papal privileges. The new institution, which initially only held courses in civil and canon law, was authorized to confer both the academic \"licentia\" and \"doctoratus\" titles that later became a single \"laurea\" (degree) title. The Bishop, as Rector of Studies, proclaimed and conferred the title on the new doctors.\n\nThe early decades were marked by discontinuity, due to epidemics and crises that plagued the region between the 1420s and the 1430s following the annexation of the Piedmont territories to the Duchy of Savoy and by difficult relations between the University and the local Public Administration. After a series of interruptions in its activities, the university was moved to Chieri (between 1427 and 1434) and later, in 1434, to Savigliano.\n\nIn 1436, when the institution returned to Turin, Ludovico di Savoia, who succeeded Amedeo VIII, introduced a new order of studies whereby the Government gained greater control over the University. The ducal licenses of 6 October 1436 set up the three faculties of Theology, Arts and Medicine, and Law, and twenty-five lectureships or chairs. The growth and development of the role of Turin as the subalpine capital led to the consolidation of the University and a stability that lasted for almost a hundred years.\n\nFrom 1443 the University was housed in a modest building purchased and refurbished by the City for this purpose on the corner of via Doragrossa (now Via Garibaldi) and via dello Studio (today's via San Francesco d'Assisi) directly behind the Town Hall, until the opening of the university premises in via Po, in 1720.\nThe Study, closed at the beginning of 1536 with the French occupation, reopened in 1558 with lecturers at Mondov\u00ec; it was re-established in Turin in 1566.\nleft|thumb|The Minerva Statue in front of the Rectorate Palace at the University of Turin.\n\n Instability and reform by Victor Amadeus II (1566\u20131739) \n\nWith Emmanuel Philibert and Charles Emmanuel I, the University enjoyed a season of great prosperity due to the presence of illustrious teachers and a sizeable and culturally motivated student body. However, a lengthy period of decline set in around the second half of the 17th century because of plagues, famines and continual wars: courses were irregular or temporarily suspended, the number of chairs was reduced, and for those temporarily vacant, it was necessary to resort to private instruction.\n\nThe opening of the new premises marked a major turning point in the history of the greatest Piedmontese educational institution. The inauguration building in via Po, close to Piazza Castello, and the seats of power and other educational institutions of the City, coincided with the academic year 1720\u20131721, the first year of the reform of university studies passed by Victor Amadeus II in the context of a radical renewal at all levels of public administration and education.\n\nVictor Amadeus II was convinced that an efficient university controlled directly by the State was the only way to form a faithful and well-trained ruling class that could support him in the process of modernizing the Nation. While the War of Spanish Succession was still being fought, the Duke had entrusted his officials to gather information concerning the structure of the major Italian and foreign universities, and charged the Sicilian jurist Francesco D'Aguirre with the task of drawing up a reorganization project.\n\nAmong the notable innovations of the reform enacted by Victor Amadeus was the opening of the Collegio delle Province (Halls of Residence for the Provinces), which housed one hundred young people of low social extraction to aid them in completing their studies at the State's expenses, and the establishment of the Chair of Eloquenza Italiana (Italian Rhetoric) alongside that of Latin. This had a noteworthy effect on the cultural linguistic models of the Duchy. At the time, the Piedmontese Studium became a point of reference for university reforms at Parma and Modena and subsequently a model for the universities in Cagliari and Sassari.\n\n French domination (1739\u20131817) \n\nCharles Emmanuel III continued the policy of innovation and consolidation begun by Victor Amadeus II and created a University Museum in 1739. However, in the last decades of the 18th century, the course of events at the university, closely connected to international developments, led to great urban unrest and the loss of state prestige. The revolt of university students in 1791 joined by artisans who stormed the \"Collegio delle Province\" in 1792 causing numerous victims, was a clear instance of this conflict.\n\nThe university and \"Collegio\" were closed in the autumn of the same year when war broke out against revolutionary France. In January 1799, the provisional Piedmontese government reopened the university under the control of the \"Comit\u00e9 d'instruction publique\" (Committee for Public Instruction). In summer 1800, the second provisional government transformed the university into a National University and replaced the faculties with eight Special Schools, which were based on the existing pattern: Chemistry and Rural Economy, Surgery, Drawing and Fine Arts, Legislation, Medicine, Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Literature and Veterinary Medicine. Two years later, Literature was abolished, Medicine and Surgery were merged and many chairs were suppressed for financial reasons.\n\nAnother milestone in the Turin university system was the introduction of the new Imperial order, since Piedmont had become a French Department; this involved the personal appointment by Napoleon of a Rector to head each University. Because of its size, number of chairs, teaching staff and students the Piedmontese University became the second largest in the Empire after Paris.\n\nA famous student of this age was Joseph-Louis Lagrange.\n\n Age of Victor Emmanuel I (1817\u20131832) \nthumb|The revolt of the students of Turin University, 1821\nWith the fall of Napoleon, Victor Emmanuel I brought back the former legislation of the Savoy regime. Innovations in the following years involved establishment of the chair of Political Economy in the Faculty of Law in 1817, the opening of a Veterinary School at Venaria in 1818, and a new procedure for the appointment of the Rector by the academic staff of each Faculty, who proposed to the Sovereign a list of names of retired or teaching professors.\n\nThe uprisings in 1821 were supported by students in Turin to the extent that the Collegio delle Province had to be closed and the University itself operated only to a limited degree. To prevent student assemblies in the Capital, it was ordered that all students who did not come from the provinces of Turin, Pinerolo and Susa would continue their education in their place of residence, where coaches went to supervise the progress of their studies and to conduct so-called \"private\" examinations. In this period too participation in the appointment of the Rector was restricted: the President of the Magistrature submitted the names of five candidates to the King, chosen among the teaching staff of Surgery, Medicine, Sciences, Law, Literature and Theology but without the involvement of the professors.\n\n The Charles Albert years (1832\u20131864) \n\nCharles Albert's opening up to moderate liberalism and his international outlook had positive effects on the University, too: like the development of institutions and the foundation of others, in addition to the appointment of illustrious scholars such as the French Augustin Cauchy to teach Sublime Physics and the Dalmatian Pier Alessandro Paravia to the chair of Italian Rhetoric.\n\nIn 1832 the Institute of Forensic Medicine was set up, in 1837 a specialization course in Obstetrics was introduced and a new Theatre and Museum of Anatomy was opened at the San Giovanni Battista Hospital to bring together the materials stored at the University and those collected since 1818 at the Museum of Pathological Anatomy. In 1842 the Collegio delle Province was reopened and students gradually resumed attending courses, which were better organized thanks to the increased number of chairs. An Upper School of Methods and the Chair of the Military History of Italy (1846)\u2014which became the chair of Modern History\u2014were set up. The Chair of Political Economy was revived.\n\nThe new order of 1850 redesigned the Medicine and Surgery course to give scope for clinical experience and practice in hospitals and laid the foundations for the School of Pharmacology, which later became a Faculty.\n\n Brief decline and revival in academic research (1864\u20131905) \n\nCultural life involving intellectuals and exiles, journalists and politicians was very lively inside and outside the University until the Capital was moved to Florence: its decline commenced when members of the teaching staff were called to government duties or to State management. Thus the circles that gravitated around the Court thinned and the City itself dropped from 220,000 inhabitants to less than 190,000.\n\nHowever, the University managed to find new life among the science faculties and their staff: in fact, in early 1864, Filippo de Filippi, professor of Zoology in the Science Faculty, held the first lecture in Italy on the theories of Charles Darwin. At his death, in 1867, Michele Lessona succeeded to the chair and became director of the Museum of Zoology, then Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and, finally, Rector from 1877 to 1880.\n\nleft|250px|thumb|Botanic Gardens.\nThanks to Giulio Bizzozero, who founded the Laboratory of General Pathology (1873) and contributed largely to the spread of the microscope in addition to discovering blood platelets, medicine in Turin branched out into the field of social medicine to meet the health and sanitary needs of the population, in particular with regard to infectious diseases and infant mortality.\n\nThe political activities of Luigi Pagliani, professor of Hygiene and founder in 1878 of the Hygiene Society, were at the basis of the strategies of public health in Italy, while discoveries made by Edoardo Bellarmino Perroncito, the first to hold a Chair of Parasitology in Italy (1879), saved the lives of thousands of miners all over Europe.\n\nIn 1876, Cesare Lombroso set up the Institute of Forensic Medicine; in 1884 Carlo Forlanini tried out the first artificial lung in Turin.\n\nIn 1887 the Botanical Institute and Gardens started a systematic collection of all plants present in the Piedmont Region; in 1878 the University Consortium was constituted with the Municipality, the Province of Turin and some of the neighbouring Provinces \"in order to preserve the prestige of the University of Turin as one of the primary centres of university studies [in Italy and Europe].\"\n\nright|150px|thumb|Museum of Human Anatomy.\nAt the turn of the century some of the science institutes moved to the Valentino area and vacated the old buildings in via Cavour and via Po. The teaching and research activities of Physics, Chemistry, Pharmacology, Physiology, General Pathology, Human Anatomy, Pathological Anatomy and Forensic Medicine were relocated to purpose-built facilities.  Significant results were reached in the following years both in scientific research and in the organization of teaching.\n\nIn 1893 the foundation of the Laboratory of Political Economy connected to the University and the Industrial Museum marked a further feat beyond the scientific sphere.\n\nIn the Humanities, Arturo Graf, a \"European Turinese\", deserves special mention.\n\n 20th century and beyond \n\nleft|200px|thumb|Faculty of Economics.\nThe 20th century saw the institution of the first Italian Chair of Psychology, held by Friedrich Kiesow in 1905, the foundation of the Institute of the History of Mediaeval and Modern Art in 1907 and that of Archaeology in 1908. In 1906 the Regia Scuola Superiore di Studi Applicati al Commercio (the Royal School of Applied Studies in Commerce) commenced its courses. In 1935, this early nucleus became the fully fledged Faculty of Economics, together with the Faculty of Agriculture.\n\nAt the turn of the century, a branch of the University formed the first nucleus of the Polytechnic under the guidance of Galileo Ferraris.\nIn the same period Giuseppe Peano taught at the Faculty of Sciences.\n\nLast century, the Letters Faculty could claim staff such as Umberto Eco, Luigi Pareyson, Nicola Abbagnano, Massimo Mila, Lionello Venturi and Franco Venturi. Luigi Einaudi and Norberto Bobbio taught in the Law Faculty.\nThe Gentile Reform of 1923 officially recognized 21 universities in Italy; Turin was included among the 10 State universities directly managed and funded by the State but were independent as regards administration and teaching, as far as the law allowed, and supervised by the National Education Ministry.\n\nIn the 1930s, Giuseppe Levi trained Salvador Luria, Renato Dulbecco and Rita Levi-Montalcini, each of whom went on to win the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology (after emigrating to the United States).\n\nMany of the protagonists of Italian political and social life in the 20th century, such as Antonio Gramsci and Piero Gobetti, Palmiro Togliatti and Massimo Bontempelli, graduated from Turin University. With its rich variety of subjects, the University of Turin has always maintained a characteristic cultural imprint made up of rigour and independence in teaching, and a spirit of service and openness to European culture.\n\nIn recent years, research workers, both in the humanities and in natural sciences, have turned their attention to nations in the southern hemisphere.\nFurthermore, some departments are involved in integrated research and co-operation in line with EU universities and with universities in the developing countries.\nThe school of management and economics is the most prestigious in the country.\n\nOrganization\n\nLegal status, academic policies, and rankings \nThe current organization of the university system is based on Law 168/89, which set up the Ministero dell'Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (Ministry for the Universities and Scientific and Technological Research) and ordered a number of provisions aimed at granting greater autonomy in university administration, and in the structure of research, teaching and organization.\n\nright|200px|thumb|One of the University's buildings: Palazzo Campana.\nThe objective of the subsequent 1999 University reform was to make the Italian tertiary education system comply with the model defined by the European agreements of the Sorbonne and of Bologna. The teaching reform was implemented at the University of Turin with the development and expansion of the provisions of law. Above all applied to vocational guidance, seen as a strategic link between high school and university education, where professional training must not be given preference over the education of citizens, and of the cultivated individual as valuable per se.\n\nThe University of Turin has chosen research as its top priority: both fundamental and business-oriented research that blends skills pertaining to:\n National and international research\n Technological transfer (spin off, patents)\n Relations with local business and with the territory\n Commissioned research\n Various projects (EU structural funds, etc.)\n\nIn 2017, the University of Turin was ranked among the best 500 universities in the world by Times Higher Education. It also placed in the 551-600 bracket in QS world university rankings.\n\nCooperation and internationalization projects\nAt the international level, the University of Turin is oriented both to relations with major organizations and to collaboration with the developing countries. In the former field, relations with United Nations Agencies have been stepped up, above all with those already operating in Turin: the ILO International Training Centre through the Turin School of Development, UNICRI and UNSSC.\n\nCourses have been organized or sponsored by the University together with the Turin School of Development for some time now, e.g. the Master of Law (LL.M.) in International Trade Law, the Master of Law (LL.M.) in Intellectual Property (within the Faculty of Law, the Master in Management of Development, the master in Applied Labour Economics for Development, master in Public Procurement Management for Sustainable Development, the master in World Heritage at work, the master in Occupational Safety and Health in the Workplace, as well as the advanced course in Diplomatic and International Studies.\n\nThere are also research and teaching agreements with South American nations, using distance learning aids and short intensive exchange programmes for teaching staff and students.\n\nFrance partnered with the University of Turin to set up the Italo-French University (UIF) between 1998 and 2000. This Agency is dedicated to establishing all possible forms of collaboration between France and Italy in the area of university teaching, scientific research, and culture in general. UIF is involved in the far reaching project of the construction of a \"Europe of Learning.\"  Reflecting its raised status, UNITO has been ranked as one of the top universities in Italy, as well as a leading research university in Europe.Top 100 European Universities - Academic Ranking of World Universities 2007 \n\nReorganization and undergoing projects\nThe University of Turin is engaged not only in redesigning its teaching structure but also in a ten-year construction project to reorganize its premises; work is already underway on refurbishing and rationalizing existing buildings, and on newly acquired property.\n\nAmong the projects already completed is the new site at Grugliasco, which houses the Faculties of Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture. Worth mentioning, too, are: the sites of the ex-Italgas works (now Palazzina Luigi Einaudi, already assigned to the Faculties of Law and Political Science for teaching purposes), and the ex-Manifattura Tabacchi; construction of the new Scuola di Biotecnologie; realization at the Centro Pier della Francesca of new laboratories, classrooms and student common rooms for the Computer Science Department, and finally construction of a new building for teaching purposes at the Ospedale San Luigi, Orbassano.\n\nSince 2001/2002 the Faculties of Political Science and Law have been running a three-year course and a master's programme in Co-operation in Development and Peace-keeping.\n\n Campuses \n\n Main campus in Turin \nright|200px|thumb|Emporium, the University of Turin's store and gift shopThe University is divided into 55 departments that are located in 13 faculties:\n Faculty of Agriculture\n Faculty of Economics\n Faculty of Education\n Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literature\n Faculty of Law\n Faculty of Letters and Philosophy\n Faculty of Mathematical, Physics and Natural Sciences\n Faculty of Medicine and Surgery\n Second Faculty of Medicine and Surgery \"St. Luigi Gonzaga\"\n Faculty of Pharmacy\n Faculty of Political Sciences\n Faculty of Psychology\n Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\n\n Special units \nIn addition, the University has created schools specifically devoted to certain academic fields, either alone or with partnerships with other institutions.

{"title": "Urelement", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urelement", "text": "In set theory, a branch of mathematics, an urelement or ur-element (from the German prefix ur-, 'primordial') is an object that is not a set, but that may be an element of a set. Urelements are sometimes called \"atoms\" or \"individuals.\"\n\n Theory \nThere are several different but essentially equivalent ways to treat urelements in a first-order theory.\n\nOne way is to work in a first-order theory with two sorts, sets and urelements, with a \u2208 b only defined when b is a set. \nIn this case, if U is an urelement, it makes no sense to say\n\nalthough\n\nis perfectly legitimate.\n\nAnother way is to work in a one-sorted theory with a unary relation used to distinguish sets and urelements. As non-empty sets contain members while urelements do not, the unary relation is only needed to distinguish the empty set from urelements. Note that in this case, the axiom of extensionality must be formulated to apply only to objects that are not urelements.\n\nThis situation is analogous to the treatments of theories of sets and classes. Indeed, urelements are in some sense dual to proper classes: urelements cannot have members whereas proper classes cannot be members. Put differently, urelements are minimal objects while proper classes are maximal objects by the membership relation (which, of course, is not an order relation, so this analogy is not to be taken literally).\n\n Urelements in set theory \nThe Zermelo set theory of 1908 included urelements, and hence is a version we now call ZFA or ZFCA (i.e. ZFA with axiom of choice).Dexter Chua et al.: ZFA: Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with atoms, on: ncatlab.org: nLab, revised on July 16, 2016 It was soon realized that in the context of this and closely related axiomatic set theories, the urelements were not needed because they can easily be modeled in a set theory without urelements.  Thus, standard expositions of the canonical axiomatic set theories ZF and ZFC do not mention urelements. (For an exception, see Suppes.) Axiomatizations of set theory that do invoke urelements include Kripke\u2013Platek set theory with urelements, and the variant of Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory described by Mendelson. In type theory, an object of type 0 can be called an urelement; hence the name \"atom.\"\n\nAdding urelements to the system New Foundations (NF) to produce NFU has surprising consequences. In particular, Jensen proved the consistency of NFU relative to Peano arithmetic; meanwhile, the consistency of NF relative to anything remains an open problem, pending verification of Holmes's proof of its consistency relative to ZF. Moreover, NFU remains relatively consistent when augmented with an axiom of infinity and the axiom of choice. Meanwhile, the negation of the axiom of choice is, curiously, an NF theorem. Holmes (1998) takes these facts as evidence that NFU is a more successful foundation for mathematics than NF. Holmes  further argues that set theory is more natural with than without urelements, since we may take as urelements the objects of any theory or of the physical universe.Holmes, Randall, 1998.  Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set. Academia-Bruylant. In finitist set theory, urelements are mapped to the lowest-level components of the target phenomenon, such as atomic constituents of a physical object or members of an organisation.\n\n Quine atoms \n\nAn alternative approach to urelements is to consider them, instead of as a type of object other than sets, as a particular type of set. Quine atoms (named after Willard Van Orman Quine) are sets that only contain themselves, that is, sets that satisfy the formula x\u00a0=\u00a0{x}.\n\nQuine atoms cannot exist in systems of set theory that include the axiom of regularity, but they can exist in non-well-founded set theory. ZF set theory with the axiom of regularity removed cannot prove that any non-well-founded sets exist (or rather, this would mean ZF is inconsistent), but it is compatible with the existence of Quine atoms. Aczel's anti-foundation axiom implies there is a unique Quine atom. Other non-well-founded theories may admit many distinct Quine atoms; at the opposite end of the spectrum lies Boffa's axiom of superuniversality, which implies that the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.\n\nQuine atoms also appear in Quine's New Foundations, which allows more than one such set to exist.\n\nQuine atoms are the only sets called reflexive sets by Peter Aczel, although other authors, e.g. Jon Barwise and Lawrence Moss use the latter term to denote the larger class of sets with the property x\u00a0\u2208\u00a0x.\n\n References \n\nExternal links\n\n "}

In the third (1782) edition of Waring's Meditationes Algebraicae, Wilson's theorem appears as problem 5 on page 380.  On that page, Waring states:  \"Hanc maxime elegantem primorum numerorum proprietatem invenit vir clarissimus, rerumque mathematicarum peritissimus Joannes Wilson Armiger.\"  (A man most illustrious and most skilled in mathematics, Squire John Wilson, found this most elegant property of prime numbers.) Edward Waring announced the theorem in 1770, although neither he nor his student Wilson could prove it. Lagrange gave the first proof in 1771.Joseph Louis Lagrange, \"Demonstration d'un th\u00e9or\u00e8me nouveau concernant les nombres premiers\" (Proof of a new theorem concerning prime numbers), Nouveaux M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences et Belles-Lettres (Berlin), vol. 2, pages 125\u2013137 (1771).  There is evidence that Leibniz was also aware of the result a century earlier, but he never published it.Giovanni Vacca (1899) \"Sui manoscritti inediti di Leibniz\" (On unpublished manuscripts of Leibniz),\nBollettino di bibliografia e storia delle scienze matematiche ... (Bulletin of the bibliography and history of mathematics), vol. 2, pages 113\u2013116; see page 114 (in Italian).  Vacca quotes from Leibniz's mathematical manuscripts kept at the Royal Public Library in Hanover (Germany), vol. 3 B, bundle 11, page 10:  Original :  Inoltre egli intravide anche il teorema di Wilson, come risulta dall'enunciato seguente:\"Productus continuorum usque ad numerum qui antepraecedit datum divisus per datum relinquit 1 (vel complementum ad unum?) si datus sit primitivus.  Si datus sit derivativus relinquet numerum qui cum dato habeat communem mensuram unitate majorem.\"Egli non giunse pero a dimostrarlo.Translation :  In addition, he [Leibniz] also glimpsed Wilson's theorem, as shown in the following statement: \"The product of all integers preceding the given integer, when divided by the given integer, leaves 1 (or the complement of 1?) if the given integer be prime.  If the given integer be composite, it leaves a number which has a common factor with the given integer [which is] greater than one.\"However, he didn't succeed in proving it. See also:  Giuseppe Peano, ed., Formulaire de math\u00e9matiques, vol. 2, no. 3, page 85 (1897).\n\nExample\nFor each of the values of n from 2 to 30, the following table shows the number (n \u2212 1)! and the remainder when (n \u2212 1)! is divided by n.

That  shall be proven to be true if n were a prime and false if n were a composite. The false case implies that  only if n were a prime. Also, for a prime modulusLandau, two proofs of thm. 78, both proofs below make use of the fact that the residue classes modulo a prime number are a field\u2014see the article prime field for more details. Lagrange's theorem, which states that in any field a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots, is needed for both proofs.\n\nComposite modulus\n\nIf n is composite it is divisible by some prime number q, where . If  were congruent to  then it would also be congruent to \u22121 (mod q). But (n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)!\u00a0\u2261\u00a00\u00a0(mod\u00a0q).\n\nIn fact, more is true. With the sole exception of 4, where 3!\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0\u2261\u00a02\u00a0(mod\u00a04), if n is composite then (n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)! is congruent to 0 (mod\u00a0n). The proof is divided into two cases: First, if n can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, , where 2\u00a0\u2264\u00a0a < b\u00a0\u2264\u00a0n\u00a0\u2212\u00a02, then both a and b will appear in the product  and (n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)! will be divisible by n. If n has no such factorization, then it must be the square of some prime q, q\u00a0>\u00a02. But then 2q\u00a0<\u00a0q2\u00a0=\u00a0n, both q and 2q will be factors of (n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)!, and again n divides (n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)!.\n\nPrime modulus\n\n Elementary proof\n\nThe result is trivial when , so assume p is an odd prime, . Since the residue classes (mod p) are a field, every non-zero a has a unique multiplicative inverse, a\u22121. Lagrange's theorem implies that the only values of a for which  are  (because the congruence  can have at most two roots (mod p)). Therefore, with the exception of \u00b11, the factors of  can be arranged in unequal pairs,When n = 3, the only factors are \u00b11 where the product of each pair is . This proves Wilson's theorem.\n\nFor example, if ,\n\n Proof using Fermat's little theorem\n\nAgain, the result is trivial for p\u00a0=\u00a02, so suppose p is an odd prime, . Consider the polynomial\n\ng has degree , leading term , and constant term . Its  roots are 1, 2, ..., .\n\nNow consider\n\nh also has degree  and leading term . Modulo p,  Fermat's little theorem says it also has the same  roots, 1, 2, ..., .\n\nFinally, consider\n\nf has degree at most p\u00a0\u2212\u00a02 (since the leading terms cancel), and modulo p also has the  roots 1, 2, ..., . But Lagrange's theorem says it cannot have more than p\u00a0\u2212\u00a02 roots. Therefore, f must be identically zero (mod p), so its constant term . This is Wilson's theorem.\n\n Proof using the Sylow theorems\n\nIt is possible to deduce Wilson's theorem from a particular application of the Sylow theorems. Let p be a prime. It is immediate to deduce that the symmetric group  has exactly  elements of order p, namely the p-cycles . On the other hand, each Sylow p-subgroup in  is a copy of . Hence it follows that the number of Sylow p-subgroups is . The third Sylow theorem implies\n\nMultiplying both sides by  gives\n\nthat is, the result.\n\nApplications\n\nPrimality tests\nIn practice, Wilson's theorem is useless as a primality test because computing (n \u2212 1)! modulo n for large n is computationally complex, and much faster primality tests are known (indeed, even trial division is considerably more efficient).\n\nQuadratic residues\nUsing Wilson's Theorem, for any odd prime , we can rearrange the left hand side of\n\nto obtain the equality\n\nThis becomes\n\nor\n\nWe can use this fact to prove part of a famous result: for any prime p such that p\u00a0\u2261\u00a01\u00a0(mod\u00a04), the number (\u22121) is a square (quadratic residue) mod p.  For suppose p\u00a0=\u00a04k\u00a0+\u00a01 for some integer k.  Then we can take m\u00a0=\u00a02k above, and we conclude that (m!)2 is congruent to (\u22121).\n\nFormulas for primes\nWilson's theorem has been used to construct formulas for primes, but they are too slow to have practical value.\n\np-adic gamma function\nWilson's theorem allows one to define the p-adic gamma function.\n\nGauss's generalization\n\nGauss proved thatGauss, DA, art. 78\n\nwhere p represents an odd prime and  a positive integer. The values of m for which the product is \u22121 are precisely the ones where there is a primitive root modulo m.\n\nThis further generalizes to the fact that in any finite abelian group, either the product of all elements is the identity, or there is precisely one element a of order 2 (but not both). In the latter case, the product of all elements equals\u00a0a.\n\nSee also\nWilson prime\nTable of congruences\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nThe Disquisitiones Arithmeticae has been translated from Gauss's Ciceronian Latin into English and German.

{"title": "Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory", "text": "In set theory, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, named after mathematicians Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel, is an axiomatic system that was proposed in the early twentieth century in order to formulate a theory of sets free of paradoxes such as Russell's paradox.  Today, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, with the historically controversial axiom of choice (AC) included, is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of mathematics. Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included is abbreviated ZFC, where C stands for \"choice\",.  \"Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (abbreviated as ZFC where C stands for the axiom of Choice\" and ZF refers to the axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. \n\nZermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory is intended to formalize a single primitive notion, that of a hereditary well-founded set, so that all entities in the universe of discourse are such sets. Thus the axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory refer only to pure sets and prevent its models from containing urelements (elements of sets that are not themselves sets). Furthermore, proper classes (collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members which are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly. Specifically, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory does not allow for the existence of a universal set (a set containing all sets) nor for unrestricted comprehension, thereby avoiding Russell's paradox. Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory (NBG) is a commonly used conservative extension of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory that does allow explicit treatment of proper classes.\n\nThere are many equivalent formulations of the axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.  Most of the axioms state the existence of particular sets defined from other sets. For example, the axiom of pairing says that given any two sets a and b there is a new set {a, b} containing exactly a and b. Other axioms describe properties of set membership. A goal of the axioms is that each axiom should be true if interpreted as a statement about the collection of all sets in the von Neumann universe (also known as the cumulative hierarchy).\n\nThe metamathematics of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory has been extensively studied. Landmark results in this area established the logical independence of the axiom of choice from the remaining ZFC axioms (see Axiom of choice#Independence) and of the continuum hypothesis from ZFC. The consistency of a theory such as ZFC cannot be proved within the theory itself, as shown by G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem.\n\nFormally, ZFC is a one-sorted theory in first-order logic. The signature has equality and a single primitive binary relation, set membership, which is usually denoted \u2208. The formula a \u2208 b means that the set a is a member of the set b (which is also read, \"a is an element of b\" or \"a is in b\").\n\n History \n\nThe modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. However, the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory, such as Russell's paradox, led to the desire for a more rigorous form of set theory that was free of these paradoxes.\n\nIn 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed the first axiomatic set theory, Zermelo set theory. However, as first pointed out by Abraham Fraenkel in a 1921 letter to Zermelo, this theory was incapable of proving the existence of certain sets and cardinal numbers whose existence was taken for granted by most set theorists of the time, notably the cardinal number \u2135\u03c9 and the set {Z0, \u2118(Z0), \u2118(\u2118(Z0)),...}, where Z0 is any infinite set and \u2118 is the power set operation.. Moreover, one of Zermelo's axioms invoked a concept, that of a \"definite\" property, whose operational meaning was not clear. In 1922, Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently proposed operationalizing a \"definite\" property as one that could be formulated as a well-formed formula in a first-order logic whose atomic formulas were limited to set membership and identity. They also independently proposed replacing the axiom schema of specification with the axiom schema of replacement. Appending this schema, as well as the axiom of regularity (first proposed by John von Neumann), to Zermelo set theory yields the theory denoted by ZF. Adding to ZF either the axiom of choice (AC) or a statement that is equivalent to it yields ZFC.\n\n Axioms \n\nThere are many equivalent formulations of the ZFC axioms; for a discussion of this see .  The following particular axiom set is from . The axioms per se are expressed in the symbolism of first order logic. The associated English prose is only intended to aid the intuition.\n\nAll formulations of ZFC imply that at least one set exists. Kunen includes an axiom that directly asserts the existence of a set, in addition to the axioms given below (although he notes that he does so only \u201cfor emphasis\u201d).. Its omission here can be justified in two ways. First, in the standard semantics of first-order logic in which ZFC is typically formalized, the domain of discourse must be nonempty. Hence, it is a logical theorem of first-order logic that something exists \u2014 usually expressed as the assertion that something is identical to itself, \u2203x(x=x). Consequently, it is a theorem of every first-order theory that something exists. However, as noted above, because in the intended semantics of ZFC there are only sets, the interpretation of this logical theorem in the context of ZFC is that some set exists. Hence, there is no need for a separate axiom asserting that a set exists. Second, however, even if ZFC is formulated in so-called free logic, in which it is not provable from logic alone that something exists, the axiom of infinity (below) asserts that an infinite set exists. This implies that a set exists and so, once again, it is superfluous to include an axiom asserting as much.\n\n 1. Axiom of extensionality \n\nTwo sets are equal (are the same set) if they have the same elements.\n\n \n\nThe converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of equality. If the background logic does not include equality \"=\", x=y may be defined as an abbreviation for the following formula:, def.\u00a01.\n\n \n\nIn this case, the axiom of extensionality can be reformulated as\n\n \n\nwhich says that if  x and y have the same elements, then they belong to the same sets..\n\n 2. Axiom of regularity (also called the axiom of foundation) \n\nEvery non-empty set x contains a member y such that x and y are disjoint sets.\n\n .\nor in modern notation:\n \n\nThis implies, for example, that no set is an element of itself and that every set has an ordinal rank.\n\n 3. Axiom schema of specification (also called the axiom schema of separation or of restricted comprehension) \n\nSubsets are commonly constructed using set builder notation. For example, the even integers can be constructed as the subset of the integers  satisfying the congruence modulo predicate :\n\n \n\nIn general, the subset of a set z obeying a formula (x) with one free variable x may be written as:\n\n \n\nThe axiom schema of specification states that this subset always exists (it is an axiom schema because there is one axiom for each ). Formally, let  be any formula in the language of ZFC with all free variables among  (y is not free in ). Then:\n\n \n\nNote that the axiom schema of specification can only construct subsets, and does not allow the construction of entities of the more general form:\n\n \n\nThis restriction is necessary to avoid Russell's paradox and its variants that accompany naive set theory with unrestricted comprehension.\n\nIn some other axiomatizations of ZF, this axiom is redundant in that it follows from the axiom schema of replacement and the axiom of the empty set.\n\nOn the other hand, the axiom of specification can be used to prove the existence of the empty set, denoted , once at least one set is known to exist (see above). One way to do this is to use a property  which no set has. For example, if w is any existing set, the empty set can be constructed as\n\n .\n\nThus the axiom of the empty set is implied by the nine axioms presented here.  The axiom of extensionality implies the empty set is unique (does not depend on w). It is common to make a definitional extension that adds the symbol \"\" to the language of ZFC.\n\n 4. Axiom of pairing \n\nIf x and y are sets, then there exists a set which contains x and y as elements.\n\n \n\nThe axiom schema of specification must be used to reduce this to a set with exactly these two elements. The axiom of pairing is part of Z, but is redundant in ZF because it follows from the axiom schema of replacement, if we are given a set with at least two elements. The existence of a set with at least two elements is assured by either the axiom of infinity, or by the axiom schema of specification and  the axiom of the power set applied twice to any set.\n\n 5. Axiom of union \n\nThe union over the elements of a set exists. For example, the union over the elements of the set  is .\n\nThe axiom of union states that for any set of sets  there is a set  containing every element that is a member of some member of :\n \nAlthough this formula doesn't directly assert the existence of , the set  can be constructed from  in the above using the axiom schema of specification:\n \n\n 6. Axiom schema of replacement \n\nThe axiom schema of replacement asserts that the image of a set under any definable function will also fall inside a set.\n\nFormally, let  be any formula in the language of ZFC whose free variables are among , so that in particular  is not free in . Then:\n\n \n\nIn other words, if the relation  represents a definable function ,  represents its domain, and  is a set for every , then the range of  is a subset of some set . The form stated here, in which  may be larger than strictly necessary, is sometimes called the axiom schema of collection.\n\n 7. Axiom of infinity \n\n First few von Neumann ordinals 0 =  = \u2205 1 =  =  2 =  =  3 =  =  4 =  = \n\nLet  abbreviate , where  is some set. (We can see that  is a valid set by applying the Axiom of Pairing with  so that the set  is ). Then there exists a set X such that the empty set  is a member of X and, whenever a set y is a member of X, then  is also a member of X.\n\n \n\nMore colloquially, there exists a set X having infinitely many members. (It must be established, however, that these members are all different, because if two elements are the same, the sequence will loop around in a finite cycle of sets. The axiom of regularity prevents this from happening.) The minimal set X satisfying the axiom of infinity is the von Neumann ordinal \u03c9, which can also be thought of as the set of natural numbers .\n\n 8. Axiom of power set \n\nBy definition a set z is a subset of a set x if and only if every element of z is also an element of x:\n\n \n\nThe Axiom of Power Set states that for any set x, there is a set y that  contains every subset of x:\n\n \n\nThe axiom schema of specification is then used to define the power set P(x) as the subset of such a y containing the subsets of x exactly:\n\n \n\nAxioms 1\u20138 define ZF. Alternative forms of these axioms are often encountered, some of which are listed in . Some ZF axiomatizations include an axiom asserting that the empty set exists. The axioms of pairing, union, replacement, and power set are often stated so that the members of the set x whose existence is being asserted are just those sets which the axiom asserts x must contain.\n\nThe following axiom is added to turn ZF into ZFC:\n\n 9. Well-ordering theorem \n\nFor any set X, there is a binary relation R which well-orders X.  This means R is a linear order on X such that every nonempty subset of X has a member which is minimal under R.\n\n \n\nGiven axioms 1\u20138, there are many statements  equivalent to axiom 9, the best known of which is the axiom of choice (AC), which goes as follows. Let X be a set whose members are all non-empty. Then there exists a function f from X to the union of the members of X, called a \"choice function\", such that for all  one has . Since the existence of a choice function when X is a finite set is easily proved from axioms 1\u20138, AC only matters for certain infinite sets. AC is characterized as nonconstructive because it asserts the existence of a choice set but says nothing about how the choice set is to be \"constructed.\"  Much research has sought to characterize the definability (or lack thereof) of certain sets whose existence AC asserts.\n\n Motivation via the cumulative hierarchy \n\nOne motivation for the ZFC axioms is the cumulative hierarchy of sets introduced by John von Neumann., section\u00a02. In this viewpoint, the universe of set theory is built up in stages, with one stage for each ordinal number. At stage 0 there are no sets yet. At each following stage, a set is added to the universe if all of its elements have been added at previous stages. Thus the empty set is added at stage 1, and the set containing the empty set is added at stage 2.. The collection of all sets that are obtained in this way, over all the stages, is known as V. The sets in V can be arranged into a hierarchy by assigning to each set the first stage at which that set was added to V.\n\nIt is provable that a set is in V if and only if the set is pure and well-founded; and provable that V satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, if the class of ordinals has appropriate reflection properties. For example, suppose that a set x is added at stage \u03b1, which means that every element of x was added at a stage earlier than \u03b1. Then every subset of x is also added at stage \u03b1, because all elements of any subset of x were also added before stage \u03b1. This means that any subset of x which the axiom of separation can construct is added at stage \u03b1, and that the powerset of x will be added at the next stage after \u03b1. For a complete argument that V satisfies ZFC see .\n\nThe picture of the universe of sets stratified into the cumulative hierarchy is characteristic of ZFC and related axiomatic set theories such as Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory (often called NBG) and Morse\u2013Kelley set theory. The cumulative hierarchy is not compatible with other set theories such as New Foundations.\n\nIt is possible to change the definition of V so that at each stage, instead of adding all the subsets of the union of the previous stages, subsets are only added if they are definable in a certain sense. This results in a more \"narrow\" hierarchy which gives the constructible universe L, which also satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, including the axiom of choice. It is independent from the ZFC axioms whether V\u00a0=\u00a0L. Although the structure of L is more regular and well behaved than that of\u00a0V, few mathematicians argue that\u00a0V =\u00a0L should be added to ZFC as an additional \"axiom of constructibility\".\n\n Metamathematics \n\nVirtual classes\n\nAs noted earlier, proper classes (collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members which are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly in ZF (and thus ZFC).\nAn alternative to proper classes while staying within ZF and ZFC is the virtual class notational construct introduced by , where the entire construct y \u2208 { x | Fx } is simply defined as Fy.  This provides a simple notation for classes that can contain sets but need not themselves be sets, while not committing to the ontology of classes (because the notation can be syntactically converted to one that only uses sets).  Quine's approach built on the earlier approach of .  Virtual classes are also used in , , and in the Metamath implementation of ZFC.\n\nVon Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory\nThe axiom schemata of replacement and separation each contain infinitely many instances.  included a result first proved in his 1957 Ph.D. thesis: if ZFC is consistent, it is impossible to axiomatize ZFC using only finitely many axioms. On the other hand, von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory (NBG) can be finitely axiomatized. The ontology of NBG includes proper classes as well as sets; a set is any class that can be a member of another class. NBG and ZFC are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other.\n\nConsistency\nG\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem says that a recursively axiomatizable system that can interpret Robinson arithmetic can prove its own consistency only if it is inconsistent. Moreover, Robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in general set theory, a small fragment of ZFC. Hence the consistency of ZFC cannot be proved within ZFC itself (unless it is actually inconsistent). Thus, to the extent that ZFC is identified with ordinary mathematics, the consistency of ZFC cannot be demonstrated in ordinary mathematics. The consistency of ZFC does follow from the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal, which is unprovable in ZFC if ZFC is consistent. Nevertheless, it is deemed unlikely that ZFC harbors an unsuspected contradiction; it is widely believed that if ZFC were inconsistent, that fact would have been uncovered by now. This much is certain \u2014 ZFC is immune to the classic paradoxes of naive set theory: Russell's paradox, the Burali-Forti paradox, and Cantor's paradox.\n\n studied a subtheory of ZFC consisting of the axioms of extensionality, union, powerset, replacement, and choice. Using models, they proved this subtheory consistent, and proved that each of the axioms of extensionality, replacement, and power set is independent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory. If this subtheory is augmented with the axiom of infinity, each of the axioms of union, choice, and infinity is independent of the five remaining axioms. Because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of ZFC except the axiom of regularity, that axiom is independent of the other ZFC axioms.\n\nIf consistent, ZFC cannot prove the existence of the inaccessible cardinals that category theory requires. Huge sets of this nature are possible if ZF is augmented with Tarski's axiom.. Assuming that axiom turns the axioms of infinity, power set, and choice (7 \u2212 9 above) into theorems.\n\n Independence \n\nMany important statements are independent of ZFC (see list of statements undecidable in ZFC). The independence is usually proved by forcing, whereby it is shown that every countable transitive model of ZFC (sometimes augmented with large cardinal axioms) can be expanded to satisfy the statement in question. A different expansion is then shown to satisfy the negation of the statement. An independence proof by forcing automatically proves independence from arithmetical statements, other concrete statements, and large cardinal axioms. Some statements independent of ZFC can be proven to hold in particular inner models, such as in the constructible universe. However, some statements that are true about constructible sets are not consistent with hypothesized large cardinal axioms.\n\nForcing proves that the following statements are independent of ZFC:\n\n Continuum hypothesis\n Diamond principle\n Suslin hypothesis\n Martin's axiom (which is not a ZFC axiom)\n Axiom of Constructibility (V=L) (which is also not a ZFC axiom).\n\nRemarks:\n\n The consistency of V=L is provable by inner models but not forcing: every model of ZF can be trimmed to become a model of ZFC + V=L.\n The Diamond Principle implies the Continuum Hypothesis and the negation of the Suslin Hypothesis.\n Martin's axiom plus the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis implies the Suslin Hypothesis.\n The constructible universe satisfies the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, the Diamond Principle, Martin's Axiom and the Kurepa Hypothesis.\n The failure of the Kurepa hypothesis is equiconsistent with the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal.\n\nA variation on the method of forcing can also be used to demonstrate the consistency and unprovability of the axiom of choice, i.e., that the axiom of choice is independent of ZF. The consistency of choice can be (relatively) easily verified by proving that the inner model L satisfies choice. (Thus every model of ZF contains a submodel of ZFC, so that Con(ZF) implies Con(ZFC).) Since forcing preserves choice, we cannot directly produce a model contradicting choice from a model satisfying choice. However, we can use forcing to create a model which contains a suitable submodel, namely one satisfying ZF but not C.\n\nAnother method of proving independence results, one owing nothing to forcing, is based on G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem. This approach employs the statement whose independence is being examined, to prove the existence of a set model of ZFC, in which case Con(ZFC) is true. Since ZFC satisfies the conditions of G\u00f6del's second theorem, the consistency of ZFC is unprovable in ZFC (provided that ZFC is, in fact, consistent). Hence no statement allowing such a proof can be proved in ZFC. This method can prove that the existence of large cardinals is not provable in ZFC, but cannot prove that assuming such cardinals, given ZFC, is free of contradiction.\n\nProposed additions\nThe project to unify set theorists behind additional axioms to resolve the Continuum Hypothesis or other meta-mathematical ambiguities is sometimes known as \"G\u00f6del's program\".. Mathematicians currently debate which axioms are the most plausible or \"self-evident\", which axioms are the most useful in various domains, and about to what degree usefulness should be traded off with plausibility; some \"multiverse\" set theorists argue that usefulness should be the sole ultimate criterion in which axioms to customarily adopt. One school of thought leans on expanding the \"iterative\" concept of a set to produce a set-theoretic universe with an interesting and complex but reasonably tractable structure by adopting forcing axioms; another school advocates for a tidier, less cluttered universe, perhaps focused on a \"core\" inner model..\n\n Criticisms \n\n For criticism of set theory in general, see Objections to set theory\n\nZFC has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak, as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the universal set.\n\nMany mathematical theorems can be proven in much weaker systems than ZFC, such as Peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic (as explored by the program of reverse mathematics). Saunders Mac Lane and Solomon Feferman have both made this point. Some of \"mainstream mathematics\" (mathematics not directly connected with axiomatic set theory) is beyond Peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic, but still, all such mathematics can be carried out in ZC (Zermelo set theory with choice), another theory weaker than ZFC. Much of the power of ZFC, including the axiom of regularity and the axiom schema of replacement, is included primarily to facilitate the study of the set theory itself.\n\nOn the other hand, among axiomatic set theories, ZFC is comparatively weak. Unlike New Foundations, ZFC does not admit the existence of a universal set. Hence the universe of sets under ZFC is not closed under the elementary operations of the algebra of sets. Unlike von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory (NBG) and Morse\u2013Kelley set theory (MK), ZFC does not admit the existence of proper classes. A further comparative weakness of ZFC is that the axiom of choice included in ZFC is weaker than the axiom of global choice included in NBG and MK.\n\nThere are numerous mathematical statements undecidable in ZFC. These include the continuum hypothesis, the Whitehead problem, and the normal Moore space conjecture. Some of these conjectures are provable with the addition of axioms such as Martin's axiom, large cardinal axioms to ZFC.  Some others are decided in ZF+AD where AD is the axiom of determinacy, a strong supposition incompatible with choice.  One attraction of large cardinal axioms is that they enable many results from ZF+AD to be established in ZFC adjoined by some large cardinal axiom (see projective determinacy). The Mizar system and Metamath have adopted Tarski\u2013Grothendieck set theory, an extension of ZFC, so that proofs involving Grothendieck universes (encountered in category theory and algebraic geometry) can be formalized.\n\n See also \n\n Foundation of mathematics\n Inner model\n Large cardinal axiom\n\nRelated axiomatic set theories:\n\n Morse\u2013Kelley set theory\n Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory\n Tarski\u2013Grothendieck set theory\n Constructive set theory\n Internal set theory\n\n Notes \n\n References \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n .\n  Fraenkel's final word on ZF and ZFC.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Patrick Suppes, 1972 (1960).
