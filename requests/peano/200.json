      "text": "In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an algebraic structure on a set A (called carrier set or underlying set) is a collection of finitary operations on A; the set A with this structure is also called an algebra.P.M. Cohn. (1981) Universal Algebra, Springer, p. 41.\n\nExamples of algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, and lattices. More complex structures can be defined by introducing multiple operations, different underlying sets, or by altering the defining axioms. Examples of more complex algebraic structures include vector spaces, modules, and algebras.\n\nThe properties of specific algebraic structures are studied in abstract algebra.  The general theory of algebraic structures has been formalized in universal algebra. The language of category theory is used to express and study relationships between different classes of algebraic and non-algebraic objects. This is because it is sometimes possible to find strong connections between some classes of objects, sometimes of different kinds. For example, Galois theory establishes a connection between certain fields and groups: two algebraic structures of different kinds.\n\n Introduction \n\nAddition and multiplication on numbers are the prototypical example of an operation that combines two elements of a set to produce a third. These operations obey several algebraic laws. For example, a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a(bc) = (ab)c, both examples of the associative law. Also a + b = b + a, and ab = ba, the commutative law. Many systems studied by mathematicians have operations that obey some, but not necessarily all, of the laws of ordinary arithmetic. For example, rotations of objects in three-dimensional space can be combined by performing the first rotation and then applying the second rotation to the object in its new orientation. This operation on rotations obeys the associative law, but can fail the commutative law.\n\nMathematicians give names to sets with one or more operations that obey a particular collection of laws, and study them in the abstract as algebraic structures. When a new problem can be shown to follow the laws of one of these algebraic structures, all the work that has been done on that category in the past can be applied to the new problem.\n\nIn full generality, algebraic structures may involve an arbitrary number of sets and operations that can combine more than two elements (higher arity), but this article focuses on binary operations on one or two sets. The examples here are by no means a complete list, but they are meant to be a representative list and include the most common structures. Longer lists of algebraic structures may be found in the external links and within :Category:Algebraic structures. Structures are listed in approximate order of increasing complexity.\n\n Examples \n\n One set with operations \n\nSimple structures: no binary operation:\n\n Set: a degenerate algebraic structure S   having no operations.\n Pointed set: S has one or more distinguished elements, often 0, 1, or both.\n Unary system: S and a single unary operation over S.\n : a unary system with S a pointed set.\n\nGroup-like structures: one binary operation. The binary operation can be indicated by any symbol, or with no symbol (juxtaposition) as is done for ordinary multiplication of real numbers.\n\n Magma or groupoid: S and a single binary operation over S.\n Semigroup: an associative magma.\n Monoid: a semigroup with Identity element.\n Group: a monoid with a unary operation (inverse), giving rise to inverse elements.\n Abelian group: a group whose binary operation is commutative.\n Semilattice: a semigroup whose operation is idempotent and commutative. The binary operation can be called either meet or join.\n Quasigroup: a magma obeying the latin square property. A quasigroup may also be represented using three binary operations.\n\n Loop: a quasigroup with identity.\n\nRing-like structures or Ringoids: two binary operations, often called addition and multiplication, with multiplication distributing over addition.\n\n Semiring: a ringoid such that S is a monoid under each operation. Addition is typically assumed to be commutative and associative, and the monoid product is assumed to distribute over the addition on both sides, and the additive identity satisfies 0 x = 0 for all x.\n Near-ring: a semiring whose additive monoid is a (not necessarily abelian) group.\n Ring: a semiring whose additive monoid is an abelian group.\n Lie ring: a ringoid whose additive monoid is an abelian group, but whose multiplicative operation satisfies the Jacobi identity rather than associativity.\n Boolean ring: a commutative ring with idempotent multiplication operation.\n Field: a commutative ring which contains a multiplicative inverse for every nonzero element\n Kleene algebras: a semiring with idempotent addition and a unary operation, the Kleene star, satisfying additional properties.\n *-algebra: a ring with an additional unary operation (*) satisfying additional properties.\n\nLattice structures: two or more binary operations, including operations called meet and join, connected by the absorption law.Ringoids and lattices can be clearly distinguished despite both having two defining binary operations. In the case of ringoids, the two operations are linked by the distributive law; in the case of lattices, they are linked by the absorption law. Ringoids also tend to have numerical models, while lattices tend to have set-theoretic models.\n\n Complete lattice: a lattice in which arbitrary meet and joins exist.\n Bounded lattice: a lattice with a greatest element and least element.\n Complemented lattice: a bounded lattice with a unary operation, complementation, denoted by postfix ⊥. The join of an element with its complement is the greatest element, and the meet of the two elements is the least element.\n Modular lattice: a lattice whose elements satisfy the additional modular identity.\n Distributive lattice: a lattice in which each of meet and join distributes over the other. Distributive lattices are modular, but the converse does not hold.\n Boolean algebra: a complemented distributive lattice. Either of meet or join can be defined in terms of the other and complementation. This can be shown to be equivalent with the ring-like structure of the same name above.\n Heyting algebra: a bounded distributive lattice with an added binary operation, relative pseudo-complement, denoted by infix →, and governed by the axioms x → x = 1, x (x → y) = x y, y (x → y) = y, x → (y z) = (x → y) (x → z).\n\nArithmetics: two binary operations, addition and multiplication. S is an infinite set. Arithmetics are pointed unary systems, whose unary operation is injective successor, and with distinguished element 0.\n\n Robinson arithmetic. Addition and multiplication are recursively defined by means of successor. 0 is the identity element for addition, and annihilates multiplication. Robinson arithmetic is listed here even though it is a variety, because of its closeness to Peano arithmetic.\n Peano arithmetic. Robinson arithmetic with an axiom schema of induction. Most ring and field axioms bearing on the properties of addition and multiplication are theorems of Peano arithmetic or of proper extensions thereof.\n\n Two sets with operations \n\nModule-like structures: composite systems involving two sets and employing at least two binary operations.\n\n Group with operators: a group G with a set Ω and a binary operation Ω × G → G satisfying certain axioms.\n Module: an abelian group M and a ring R acting as operators on M. The members of R are sometimes called scalars, and the binary operation of scalar multiplication is a function R × M → M, which satisfies several axioms. Counting the ring operations these systems have at least three operations.\n Vector space: a module where the ring R is a division ring or field.\n Graded vector space: a vector space with a direct sum decomposition breaking the space into \"grades\".\n Quadratic space: a vector space V over a field F with a function from V into F satisfying certain properties. Every quadratic space is also an inner product space (see below).\n\nAlgebra-like structures: composite system defined over two sets, a ring R and an R-module M equipped with an operation called multiplication. This can be viewed as a system with five binary operations: two operations on R, two on M and one involving both R and M.\n\n Algebra over a ring (also R-algebra): a module over a commutative ring R, which also carries a multiplication operation that is compatible with the module structure. This includes distributivity over addition and linearity with respect to multiplication by elements of R. The theory of an algebra over a field is especially well developed.\n Associative algebra: an algebra over a ring such that the multiplication is associative.\n Nonassociative algebra: a module over a commutative ring, equipped with a ring multiplication operation that is not necessarily associative. Often associativity is replaced with a different identity, such as alternation, the Jacobi identity, or the Jordan identity.\n Coalgebra: a vector space with a \"comultiplication\" defined dually to that of associative algebras.\n Lie algebra: a special type of nonassociative algebra whose product satisfies the Jacobi identity.\n Lie coalgebra: a vector space with a \"comultiplication\" defined dually to that of Lie algebras.\n Graded algebra: a graded vector space with an algebra structure compatible with the grading. The idea is that if the grades of two elements a and b are known, then the grade of ab is known, and so the location of the product ab is determined in the decomposition.\n Inner product space: an F vector space V with a sesquilinear binary operation .\n\nFour or more binary operations:\n\n Bialgebra: an associative algebra with a compatible coalgebra structure.\n Lie bialgebra: a Lie algebra with a compatible bialgebra structure.\n Hopf algebra: a bialgebra with a connection axiom (antipode).\n Clifford algebra: a graded associative algebra equipped with an exterior product from which may be derived several possible inner products.  Exterior algebras and geometric algebras are special cases of this construction.\n\n Hybrid structures \n\nAlgebraic structures can also coexist with added structure of non-algebraic nature, such as partial order or a topology. The added structure must be compatible, in some sense, with the algebraic structure.\n\n Topological group: a group with a topology compatible with the group operation.\n Lie group: a topological group with a compatible smooth manifold structure.\n Ordered groups, ordered rings and ordered fields: each type of structure with a compatible partial order.\n Archimedean group: a linearly ordered group for which the Archimedean property holds.\n Topological vector space: a vector space whose M has a compatible topology.\n Normed vector space: a vector space with a compatible norm. If such a space is complete (as a metric space) then it is called a Banach space.\n Hilbert space: an inner product space over the real or complex numbers whose inner product gives rise to a Banach space structure.\n Vertex operator algebra\n Von Neumann algebra: a *-algebra of operators on a Hilbert space equipped with the weak operator topology.\n\n Universal algebra \n\nAlgebraic structures are defined through different configurations of axioms. Universal algebra abstractly studies such objects. One major dichotomy is between structures that are axiomatized entirely by identities and structures that are not. If all axioms defining a class of algebras are identities, then this class is a variety (not to be confused with algebraic varieties of algebraic geometry).\n\nIdentities are equations formulated using only the operations the structure allows, and variables that are tacitly universally quantified over the relevant universe. Identities contain no connectives, existentially quantified variables, or relations of any kind other than the allowed operations. The study of varieties is an important part of universal algebra. An algebraic structure in a variety may be understood as the quotient algebra of term algebra (also called \"absolutely  free algebra\") divided by the equivalence relations generated by a set of identities.  So, a collection of functions with given signatures generate a free algebra, the term algebra T. Given a set of equational identities (the axioms), one may consider their symmetric, transitive closure E.  The quotient algebra T/E is then the algebraic structure or variety.  Thus, for example, groups have a signature containing two operators: the multiplication operator m, taking two arguments, and the inverse operator i, taking one argument, and the identity element e, a constant, which may be considered an operator that takes zero arguments.  Given a (countable) set of variables x, y, z, etc. the term algebra is the collection of all possible terms involving m, i, e and the variables; so for example, m(i(x), m(x,m(y,e))) would be an element of the term algebra. One of the axioms defining a group is the identity m(x, i(x)) = e; another is m(x,e) = x. The axioms can be represented as trees. These equations induce equivalence classes on the free algebra; the quotient algebra then has the algebraic structure of a group.\n\nSome structures do not form varieties, because either:\n\n It is necessary that 0 ≠ 1, 0 being the additive identity element and 1 being a multiplicative identity element, but this is a nonidentity;\n Structures such as fields have some axioms that hold only for nonzero members of S. For an algebraic structure to be a variety, its operations must be defined for all members of S; there can be no partial operations.\n\nStructures whose axioms unavoidably include nonidentities are among the most important ones in mathematics, e.g., fields and division rings. Structures with nonidentities present challenges varieties do not. For example, the direct product of two fields is not a field, because , but fields do not have zero divisors.\n\n Category theory \n\nCategory theory is another tool for studying algebraic structures (see, for example, Mac Lane 1998). A category is a collection of objects with associated morphisms. Every algebraic structure has its own notion of homomorphism, namely any function compatible with the operation(s) defining the structure. In this way, every algebraic structure gives rise to a category. For example, the category of groups has all groups as objects and all group homomorphisms as morphisms. This concrete category may be seen as a category of sets with added category-theoretic structure. Likewise, the category of topological groups (whose morphisms are the continuous group homomorphisms) is a category of topological spaces with extra structure. A forgetful functor between categories of algebraic structures \"forgets\" a part of a structure.\n\nThere are various concepts in category theory that try to capture the algebraic character of a context, for instance\n\n algebraic category\n essentially algebraic category\n presentable category\n locally presentable category\n monadic functors and categories\n universal property.\n\n Different meanings of \"structure\" \n\nIn a slight abuse of notation, the word \"structure\" can also refer to just the operations on a structure, instead of the underlying set itself. For example, the sentence, \"We have defined a ring structure on the set ,\" means that we have defined ring operations on the set . For another example, the group  can be seen as a set  that is equipped with an algebraic structure, namely the operation .\n\n See also \n\n Free object\n List of algebraic structures\n Mathematical structure\n Signature (logic)\n Structure (mathematical logic)\n\n Notes \n\n References \n\n \n \n \n Category theory\n \n \n\n External links \n\n Jipsen's algebra structures.

      "text": "Alonzo Church (June 14, 1903 – August 11, 1995) was an American mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematical logic and the foundations of theoretical computer science. He is best known for the lambda calculus, Church–Turing thesis, proving the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, Frege–Church ontology, and the Church–Rosser theorem. He also worked on philosophy of language (see e.g. Church 1970).\n\nLife\nAlonzo Church was born on June 14, 1903, in Washington, D.C., where his father, Samuel Robbins Church, was the judge of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia. The family later moved to Virginia after his father lost this position because of failing eyesight. With help from his uncle, also named Alonzo Church, the son attended the private Ridgefield School for Boys in Ridgefield, Connecticut.The Ridgefield School for Boys, also known as the Ridgefield School, was a private school that existed from 1907 to 1938. See The Ridgefield School. After graduating from Ridgefield in 1920, Church attended Princeton University, where he was an exceptional student. He published his first paper on Lorentz transformations and graduated in 1924 with a degree in mathematics. He stayed at Princeton for graduate work, earning a Ph.D. in mathematics in three years under Oswald Veblen.\n\nHe married Mary Julia Kuczinski in 1925. The couple had three children, Alonzo Church, Jr. (1929), Mary Ann (1933) and Mildred (1938).\n\nAfter receiving his Ph.D., he taught briefly as an instructor at the University of Chicago. He received a two-year National Research Fellowship that enabled him to attend Harvard University in 1927–1928, and the University of Göttingen and University of Amsterdam the following year. \n\nHe taught philosophy and mathematics at Princeton for nearly four decades, 1929–1967. He taught at the University of California, Los Angeles, 1967–1990. He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1962 in Stockholm.Church, Alonzo. \"Logic, arithmetic and automata.\"  In Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, pp. 23–35. 1962. \n\nHe received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Case Western Reserve University in 1969,Honorary degrees awarded by Case Western Reserve University Princeton University in 1985,Honorary degrees awarded by Princeton University  and the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York in 1990 in connection with an international symposium in his honor organized by John Corcoran.Finding Aid for The Honorary Degree Conferral of Doctor of Science to Alonzo Church, 1990\n\nA deeply religious person, Church was a lifelong member of the Presbyterian church. He died in 1995 and was buried in Princeton Cemetery.\n\nMathematical work\nChurch is known for the following significant accomplishments:\nHis proof that the Entscheidungsproblem, which asks for a decision procedure to determine the truth of arbitrary propositions in a first-order mathematical theory, is undecidable. This is known as Church's theorem. \nHis proof that Peano arithmetic is undecidable.  \nHis articulation of what has come to be known as the Church–Turing thesis.\nHe was the founding editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic, editing its reviews section until 1979.\nHis creation of the lambda calculus.\n\nThe lambda calculus emerged in his 1936 paper showing the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem.  This result preceded Alan Turing's work on the halting problem, which also demonstrated the existence of a problem unsolvable by mechanical means. Church and Turing then showed that the lambda calculus and the Turing machine used in Turing's halting problem were equivalent in capabilities, and subsequently demonstrated a variety of alternative \"mechanical processes for computation.\" This resulted in the Church–Turing thesis.\n\nThe efforts for automatically generating a controller implementation from specifications originates from his ideas. Just Formal Enough? Automated Analysis of EARS Requirements\n\nThe lambda calculus influenced the design of the LISP programming language and functional programming languages in general. The Church encoding is named in his honor.\n\nIn his honor the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation was established in 2015 by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation (ACM SIGLOG), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), and the Kurt Gödel Society (KGS).

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy",
      "text": "thumb|513x513px|An illustration of how the levels of the hierarchy interact and where some basic set categories lie within it.\nIn mathematical logic, the arithmetical hierarchy, arithmetic hierarchy or Kleene–Mostowski hierarchy classifies certain sets based on the complexity of formulas that define them.  Any set that receives a classification is called arithmetical.\n\nThe arithmetical hierarchy is important in recursion theory, effective descriptive set theory, and the study of formal theories such as Peano arithmetic.\n\nThe Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm provides an easy way to get an upper bound on the classifications assigned to a formula and the set it defines.\n\nThe hyperarithmetical hierarchy and the analytical hierarchy extend the arithmetical hierarchy to classify additional formulas and sets.\n\n The arithmetical hierarchy of formulas \n\nThe arithmetical hierarchy assigns classifications to the formulas in the language of first-order arithmetic.  The classifications are denoted  and  for natural numbers n (including 0). The Greek letters here are lightface symbols, which indicates that the formulas do not contain set parameters.\n\nIf a formula  is logically equivalent to a formula with only bounded quantifiers then  is assigned the classifications  and .\n\nThe classifications  and  are defined inductively for every natural number n using the following rules:\nIf  is logically equivalent to a formula of the form , where  is , then  is assigned the classification .\nIf  is logically equivalent to a formula of the form , where  is , then  is assigned the classification .\nAlso, a  formula is equivalent to a formula that begins with some existential quantifiers and alternates  times between series of existential and universal quantifiers; while a  formula is equivalent to a formula that begins with some universal quantifiers and alternates similarly.\n\nBecause every formula is equivalent to a formula in prenex normal form, every formula with no set quantifiers is assigned at least one classification.  Because redundant quantifiers can be added to any formula, once a formula is assigned the classification  or  it will be assigned the classifications  and  for every m greater than n.  The most important classification assigned to a formula is thus the one with the least n, because this is enough to determine all the other classifications.\n\n The arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers \n\nA set X of natural numbers is defined by formula φ in the language of Peano arithmetic (the first-order language with symbols \"0\" for zero, \"S\" for the successor function, \"+\" for addition, \"×\" for multiplication, and \"=\" for equality), if the elements of X are exactly the numbers that satisfy φ.  That is, for all natural numbers n,\n\nwhere  is the numeral in the language of arithmetic corresponding to . A set is definable in first-order arithmetic if it is defined by some formula in the language of Peano arithmetic.\n\nEach set X of natural numbers that is definable in first-order arithmetic is assigned classifications of the form , , and , where  is a natural number, as follows.  If X is definable by a  formula then X is assigned the classification .  If X is definable by a  formula then X is assigned the classification .  If X is both  and  then  is assigned the additional classification .\n\nNote that it rarely makes sense to speak of  formulas; the first quantifier of a formula is either existential or universal. So a  set is not defined by a  formula; rather, there are both   and   formulas that define the set.\n\nA parallel definition is used to define the arithmetical hierarchy on finite Cartesian powers of the set of natural numbers.  Instead of formulas with one free variable, formulas with k free number variables are used to define the arithmetical hierarchy on sets of k-tuples of natural numbers. These are in fact related by the use of a pairing function.\n\n Relativized arithmetical hierarchies \n\nJust as we can define what it means for a set X to be recursive relative to another set Y by allowing the computation defining X to consult Y as an oracle we can extend this notion to the whole arithmetic hierarchy and define what it means for X to be ,  or  in Y, denoted respectively   and .  To do so, fix a set of integers Y and add a predicate for membership in Y to the language of Peano arithmetic.  We then say that X is in  if it is defined by a  formula in this expanded language.  In other words, X is  if it is defined by a  formula allowed to ask questions about membership in Y.  Alternatively one can view the  sets as those sets that can be built starting with sets recursive in Y and alternately taking unions and intersections of these sets up to n times.\n\nFor example, let Y be a set of integers.  Let X be the set of numbers divisible by an element of Y.  Then X is defined by the formula  so X is in  (actually it is in  as well since we could bound both quantifiers by n).\n\n Arithmetic reducibility and degrees \n\nArithmetical reducibility is an intermediate notion between Turing reducibility and hyperarithmetic reducibility.\n\nA set is arithmetical (also arithmetic and arithmetically definable) if it is defined by some formula in the language of Peano arithmetic.  Equivalently X is arithmetical if X is  or  for some integer n.   A set X is arithmetical in a set Y, denoted , if X is definable a some formula in the language of Peano arithmetic extended by a predicate for membership in Y. Equivalently, X is arithmetical in Y if X is in  or  for some integer n. A synonym for   is: X is arithmetically reducible to Y.\n\nThe relation  is reflexive and transitive, and thus the relation  defined by the rule\n\nis an equivalence relation.  The equivalence classes of this relation are called the arithmetic degrees; they are partially ordered under .\n\nThe arithmetical hierarchy of subsets of Cantor and Baire space\n\nThe Cantor space, denoted , is the set of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s; the Baire space, denoted  or , is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. Note that elements of the Cantor space can be identified with sets of integers and elements of the Baire space with functions from integers to integers.\n\nThe ordinary axiomatization of second-order arithmetic uses a set-based language in which the set quantifiers can naturally be viewed as quantifying over Cantor space.   A subset of Cantor space is assigned the classification  if it is definable by a  formula.  The set is assigned the classification  if it is definable by a  formula.  If the set is both  and  then it is given the additional classification .  For example, let  be the set of all infinite binary strings which aren't all 0 (or equivalently the set of all non-empty sets of integers).  As  we see that  is defined by a  formula and hence is a  set.\n\nNote that while both the elements of the Cantor space (regarded as sets of integers) and subsets of the Cantor space are classified in arithmetic hierarchies,  these are not the same hierarchy.  In fact the relationship between the two hierarchies is interesting and non-trivial.  For instance the  elements of the Cantor space are not (in general) the same as the elements  of the Cantor space so that  is a  subset of the Cantor space.  However, many interesting results relate the two hierarchies.\n\nThere are two ways that a subset of Baire space can be classified in the arithmetical hierarchy.\nA subset of Baire space has a corresponding subset of Cantor space under the map that takes each function from  to  to the characteristic function of its graph.   A subset of Baire space is given the classification , , or  if and only if the corresponding subset of Cantor space has the same classification.\nAn equivalent definition of the analytical hierarchy on Baire space is given by defining the analytical hierarchy of formulas using a functional version of second-order arithmetic; then the analytical hierarchy on subsets of Cantor space can be defined from the hierarchy on Baire space.  This alternate definition gives exactly the same classifications as the first definition.\n\nA parallel definition is used to define the arithmetical hierarchy on finite Cartesian powers of Baire space or Cantor space, using formulas with several free variables.  The arithmetical hierarchy can be defined on any effective Polish space; the definition is particularly simple for Cantor space and Baire space because they fit with the language of ordinary second-order arithmetic.\n\nNote that we can also define the arithmetic hierarchy of subsets of the Cantor and Baire spaces relative to some set of integers.  In fact boldface  is just the union of  for all sets of integers Y.  Note that the boldface hierarchy is just the standard hierarchy of Borel sets.\n\n Extensions and variations\n\nIt is possible to define the arithmetical hierarchy of formulas using a language extended with a function symbol for each primitive recursive function.  This variation slightly changes the classification of , since using primitive recursive functions in first-order Peano arithmetic requires, in general, an unbounded existential quantifier, and thus some sets that are in  by this definition are in  by the definition given in the beginning of this article.  and thus all higher classes in the hierarchy remain unaffected.\n\nA more semantic variation of the hierarchy can be defined on all finitary relations on the natural numbers; the following definition is used.  Every computable relation is defined to be .  The classifications  and  are defined inductively with the following rules.\n If the relation  is  then the relation  is defined to be \n If the relation  is  then the relation  is defined to be \nThis variation slightly changes the classification of some sets. In particular, , as a class of sets (definable by the relations in the class), is identical to  as the latter was formerly defined. It can be extended to cover finitary relations on the natural numbers, Baire space, and Cantor space.\n\n Meaning of the notation\n\nThe following meanings can be attached to the notation for the arithmetical hierarchy on formulas.\n\nThe subscript  in the symbols  and  indicates the number of alternations of blocks of universal and existential number quantifiers that are used in a formula.   Moreover, the outermost block is existential in  formulas and universal in  formulas.\n\nThe superscript  in the symbols , , and  indicates the type of the objects being quantified over.  Type 0 objects are natural numbers, and objects of type  are functions that map the set of objects of  type  to the natural numbers. Quantification over higher type objects, such as functions from natural numbers to natural numbers, is described by a superscript greater than 0, as in the analytical hierarchy. The superscript 0 indicates quantifiers over numbers, the superscript 1 would indicate quantification over functions from numbers to numbers (type 1 objects), the superscript 2 would correspond to quantification over functions that take a type 1 object and return a number, and so on.\n\n Examples \n\n The  sets of numbers are those definable by a formula of the form  where  has only bounded quantifiers.  These are exactly the recursively enumerable sets.\n The set of natural numbers that are indices for Turing machines that compute total functions is .  Intuitively, an index  falls into this set if and only if for every  \"there is an  such that the Turing machine with index  halts on input  after  steps”.  A complete proof would show that the property displayed in quotes in the previous sentence is definable in the language of Peano arithmetic by a  formula.\n Every  subset of Baire space or Cantor space is an open set in the usual topology on the space.  Moreover, for any such set there is a computable enumeration of Gödel numbers of basic open sets whose union is the original set. For this reason,  sets are sometimes called effectively open.  Similarly, every  set is closed and the  sets are sometimes called effectively closed.\n Every arithmetical subset of Cantor space or Baire space is a Borel set.  The lightface Borel hierarchy extends the arithmetical hierarchy to include additional Borel sets.  For example, every  subset of Cantor or Baire space is a  set (that is, a set which equals the intersection of countably many open sets).   Moreover, each of these open sets is  and the list of Gödel numbers of these open sets has a computable enumeration.  If  is a  formula with a free set variable X and free number variables  then the  set  is the intersection of the  sets of the form  as n ranges over the set of natural numbers.\n The  formulas can be checked by going over all cases one by one, which is possible because all their quantifiers are bounded. The time for this is polynomial in their arguments (e.g. polynomial in n for ); thus their corresponding decision problems are included in E (as n is exponential in its number of bits). This no longer holds under alternative definitions of , which allow the use of primitive recursive functions, as now the quantifiers may be bound by any primitive recursive function of the arguments.\n The  formulas under an alternative definition, that allows the use of primitive recursive functions with bounded quantifiers, correspond to sets of integers of the form  for a primitive recursive function f. This is because allowing bounded quantifier adds nothing to the definition: for a primitive recursive f,  is the same as  , and  is the same as  ; with course-of-values recursion each of these can be defined by a single primitive recursion function.\n\n Properties \n\nThe following properties hold for the arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers and the arithmetical hierarchy of subsets of Cantor or Baire space.\n\n The collections  and  are closed under finite unions and finite intersections of their respective elements.\n A set is  if and only if its complement is .  A set is  if and only if the set is both  and , in which case its complement will also be .\n The inclusions  and  hold for all . Thus the hierarchy does not collapse. This is a direct consequence of Post's theorem.\n The inclusions ,  and  hold for .\nFor example, for a universal Turing machine T, the set of pairs (n,m) such that T halts on n but not on m, is in  (being computable with an oracle to the halting problem) but not in , .\n. The inclusion is strict by the definition given in this article, but an identity with  holds under one of the variations of the definition given above.\n\n Relation to Turing machines \n\nComputable sets\nIf S is a Turing computable set, then both S and its complement are recursively enumerable (if T is a Turing machine giving 1 for inputs in S and 0 otherwise, we may build a Turing machine halting only on the former, and another halting only on the latter).\n\nBy Post's theorem, both S and its complement are in . This means that S is both in  and in , and hence it is in .\n\nSimilarly, for every set S in , both S and its complement are in  and are therefore (by Post's theorem) recursively enumerable by some Turing machines T1 and T2, respectively. For every number n, exactly one of these halts. We may therefore construct a Turing machine T that alternates between T1 and T2, halting and returning 1 when the former halts or halting and returning 0 when the latter halts. Thus T halts on every n and returns whether it is in S, So S is computable.\n\nSummary of main results\nThe Turing computable sets of natural numbers are exactly the sets at level  of the arithmetical hierarchy.  The recursively enumerable sets are exactly the sets at level .\n\nNo oracle machine  is capable of solving its own halting problem (a variation of Turing's proof applies).  The halting problem for a  oracle in fact sits in .\n\nPost's theorem establishes a close connection between the arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers and the Turing degrees.  In particular, it establishes the following facts  for all n ≥ 1:\n The set  (the nth Turing jump of the empty set) is many-one complete in .\n The set  is many-one complete in .\n The set  is Turing complete in .\n\nThe polynomial hierarchy is a \"feasible resource-bounded\" version of the arithmetical hierarchy in which polynomial length bounds are placed on the numbers involved (or, equivalently, polynomial time bounds are placed on the Turing machines involved).  It gives a finer classification of some sets of natural numbers that are at level  of the arithmetical hierarchy.\n\nRelation to other hierarchies\n\n See also \n Interpretability logic\n Hierarchy (mathematics)\n Polynomial hierarchy\n\n References \n\n .\n .\n .\n .\n\nCategory:Mathematical logic hierarchies\nCategory:Computability theory\nCategory:Effective descriptive set theory\nCategory:Hierarchy\nCategory:Complexity classes"

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium",
      "text": "Bifidobacterium is a genus of gram-positive, nonmotile, often branched anaerobic bacteria.  They are ubiquitous inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract, vagina and mouth (B. dentium) of mammals, including humans.  Bifidobacteria are one of the major genera of bacteria that make up the gastrointestinal tract microbiota in mammals. Some bifidobacteria are used as probiotics.\n\nBefore the 1960s, Bifidobacterium species were collectively referred to as \"Lactobacillus bifidus\".\n\nHistory\nthumb|right|Some of the Bifidobacterium animalis bacteria found in a sample of Activia yogurt:  The numbered ticks on the scale are 10 micrometres apart.\nIn 1899, Henri Tissier, a French pediatrician at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, isolated a bacterium characterised by a Y-shaped morphology (\"bifid\") in the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants and named it \"bifidus\". In 1907, Élie Metchnikoff, deputy director at the Pasteur Institute, propounded the theory that lactic acid bacteria are beneficial to human health. Metchnikoff observed that the longevity of Bulgarian peasants was the result of their consumption of fermented milk products. Elie Metchnikoff also suggested that “oral administration of cultures of fermentative bacteria would implant the beneficial bacteria in the intestinal tract”.\n\nMetabolism\nThe genus Bifidobacterium possesses a unique fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase pathway employed to ferment carbohydrates.\n\nMuch metabolic research on bifidobacteria has focused on oligosaccharide metabolism, as these carbohydrates are available in their otherwise nutrient-limited habitats. Infant-associated bifidobacterial phylotypes appear to have evolved the ability to ferment milk oligosaccharides, whereas adult-associated species use plant oligosaccharides, consistent with what they encounter in their respective environments. As breast-fed infants often harbor bifidobacteria-dominated gut consortia, numerous applications attempt to mimic the bifidogenic properties of milk oligosaccharides. These are broadly classified as plant-derived fructooligosaccharides or dairy-derived galactooligosaccharides, which are differentially metabolized and distinct from milk oligosaccharide catabolism.\n\nResponse to oxygen\nThe sensitivity of members of the genus Bifidobacterium to O2 generally limits probiotic activity to anaerobic habitats. Recent research has reported that some Bifidobacterium strains exhibit various types of oxic growth. Low concentrations of O2 and CO2 can have a stimulatory effect on the growth of these Bifidobacterium strains. Based on the growth profiles under different O2 concentrations, the Bifidobacterium species were classified into four classes: O2-hypersensitive, O2-sensitive, O2-tolerant, and microaerophilic. The primary factor responsible for aerobic growth inhibition is proposed to be the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the growth medium. A H2O2-forming NADH oxidase was purified from O2-sensitive Bifidobacterium bifidum and was identified as a b-type dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The kinetic parameters suggested that the enzyme could be involved in H2O2 production in highly aerated environments.\n\nGenomes\nMembers of the genus Bifidobacterium have genome sizes ranging from 1.73 (Bifidobacterium indicum) to 3.25 Mb (Bifidobacterium biavatii), corresponding to 1,352 and 2,557 predicted protein-encoding open reading frames, respectively.\n\nFunctional classification of Bifidobacterium genes, including the pan-genome of this genus, revealed that 13.7% of the identified bifidobacterial genes encode enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.\n\nClinical uses\nAdding Bifidobacterium as a probiotic to conventional treatment of ulcerative colitis has been shown to be associated with improved rates of remission and improved maintenance of remission. Some Bifidobacterium strains are considered as important probiotics and used in the food industry. Different species and/or strains of bifidobacteria may exert a range of beneficial health effects, including the regulation of intestinal microbial homeostasis, the inhibition of pathogens and harmful bacteria that colonize and/or infect the gut mucosa, the modulation of local and systemic immune responses, the repression of procarcinogenic enzymatic activities within the microbiota, the production of vitamins, and the bioconversion of a number of dietary compounds into bioactive molecules. Bifidobacteria improve the gut mucosal barrier and lower levels of lipopolysaccharide in the intestine.\n\nNaturally occurring Bifidobacterium spp. may discourage the growth of Gram-negative pathogens in infants.\n\nMother's milk contains high concentrations of lactose and lower quantities of phosphate (pH buffer). Therefore, when mother's milk is fermented by lactic acid bacteria (including bifidobacteria) in the infant's gastrointestinal tract, the pH may be reduced, making it more difficult for Gram-negative bacteria to grow.\n\n Bifidobacteria and the infant gut \nThe human infant gut is relatively sterile up until birth, where it takes up bacteria from its surrounding environment and its mother. The microbiota that makes up the infant gut differs from the adult gut. An infant reaches the adult stage of their microbiome at around 3 years of age, when their microbiome diversity increases, stabilizes, and the infant switches over to solid foods. When breast-fed, infants are colonized earlier by Bifidobacterium when compared to babies that are primarily formula-fed. Bifidobacterium is the most common bacteria in the infant gut microbiome. There is more variability in genotypes over time in infants, making them less stable compared to the adult Bifidobacterium. Infants and children under 3 years old show low diversity in microbiome bacteria, but more diversity between individuals when compared to adults.  Reduction of Bifidobacterium and increase in diversity of the infant gut microbiome occurs with less breast-milk intake and increase of solid food intake. Mammalian milk all contain oligosaccharides showing natural selection. Human milk oligosaccharides are not digested by enzymes and remain whole through the digestive tract before being broken down in the colon by microbiota. Bifidobacterium species genomes of B. longnum, B. bifidum, B. breve contain genes that can hydrolyze some of the human milk oligosaccharides and these are found in higher numbers in infants that are breast-fed. Glycans that are produced by the humans are converted into food and energy for the B. bifidum. showing an example of coevolution.\n\n See also \n List of bacterial vaginosis microbiota\n Probiotic\n Proteobiotics\n Prebiotics\n Bifidobacterium animalis\n Bifidobacterium bifidum\n Bifidobacterium breve\n Bifidobacterium longum (includes B. infantis)\n\n References \n\n External links \n Bifidobacterium at Microbe Wiki\n Genomes Online Database contains many Bifidobacterium genome projects\n Comparative Analysis of Bifidobacterium Genomes (at DOE's IMG system)\nBifidobacterium at BacDive -  the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase\n\nCategory:Bifidobacteriales\nCategory:Gut flora bacteria\nCategory:Bacterial vaginosis\nCategory:Bacteria genera"

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_logic",
      "text": "Class logic is a logic in its broad sense, whose objects are called classes. In a narrower sense, one speaks of a class logic only if classes are described by a property of their elements. This class logic is thus a generalization of set theory, which allows only a limited consideration of classes.\n\nClass logic in the strict sense\nThe first class logic in the strict sense was created by Giuseppe Peano in 1889 as the basis for his arithmetic (Peano Axioms). He introduced the class term, which formally correctly describes classes through a property of their elements. Today the class term is denoted in the form {x|A(x)}, where A(x) is an arbitrary statement, which all class members x meet. Peano axiomatized the class term for the first time and used it fully.  Gottlob Frege also tried establishing the arithmetic logic with class terms in 1893; Bertrand Russell discovered a conflict in it in 1902 which became known as Russell's paradox. As a result, it became generally known that you can not safely use class terms.\n\nTo solve the problem, Russell developed his type theory from 1903 to 1908, which allowed only a very much restricted use of class terms. In the long term she not prevailed but, but more comfortable and more powerful, 1907 initiated by Ernst Zermelo set theory. Not a class logic in the narrower sense, but in its present form (ZF or NBG) because it does not axiomatize the class term, but used only in practice as a useful notation. Willard Van Orman Quine described a set theory New Foundations (NF) in 1937, oriented not at Cantor, or Zermelo-Fraenkel, but on the theory of types. In 1940 Quine advanced NF to Mathematical Logic (ML). Since the antinomy of Burali-Forti was derived in the first version of ML, John Barkley Rosser: Burali-Forti paradox. In: Journal of Symbolic Logic, Band 7, 1942, p. 1-17 Quine clarified ML, retaining the widespread use of classes, and took up a proposal by Hao Wang Hao Wang: A formal system for logic. In: Journal of Symbolic Logic, Band 15, 1950, p. 25-32  introducing in 1963 in his theory of {x|A(x)} as a virtual class, so that classes are although not yet full-fledged terms, but sub-terms in defined contexts.Willard Van Orman Quine: Mengenlehre und ihre Logik. 1973, S. 12.\n\nAfter Quine, Arnold Oberschelp developed the first fully functional modern axiomatic class logic starting in 1974. It is a consistent extension of predicate logic and allows the unrestricted use of class terms (such as Peano).Arnold Oberschelp: Allgemeine Mengenlehre. 1994, p. 75 f. It uses all classes that produce antinomies of naive set theory as a term. This is possible because the theory assumes no existence axioms for classes. It presupposes in particular any number of axioms, but can also take those and syntactically correct to formulate in the traditionally simple design with class terms. For example, the Oberschelp set theory developed the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory within the framework of class logic.The advantages of the class logic are shown in a comparison of ZFC in class logic and predicate logic form in: Arnold Oberschelp: Allgemeine Mengenlehre. 1994, p. 261. Three principles guarantee that cumbersome ZF formulas are translatable into convenient classes formulas; guarantee a class logical increase in the ZF language they form without quantities axioms together with the axioms of predicate logic an axiom system for a simple logic of general class.Arnold Oberschelp, p. 262, 41.7. The axiomatization is much more complicated, but here is reduced to a book-end to the essentials.\n\nThe principle of abstraction (Abstraktionsprinzip) states that classes describe their elements via a logical property:\n\nThe principle of extensionality (Extensionalitätsprinzip ) describes the equality of classes by matching their elements and eliminates the axiom of extensionality in ZF:\n\nThe principle of comprehension (Komprehensionsprinzip) determines the existence of a class as an element:\n\n Bibliography \n Giuseppe Peano: Arithmetices principia.

Classical logic has had much influence on analytic philosophy, the type of philosophy most often found in the English-speaking world.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nEach logical system in this class shares characteristic properties:Gabbay, Dov, (1994).

In other words, the overwhelming majority of time spent studying classical logic has been spent studying specifically propositional and first-order logic, as opposed to the other forms of classical logic.\n\nMost semantics of classical logic are bivalent, meaning all of the possible denotations of propositions can be categorised as either true or false.\n\nHistory\n\nClassical logic is a 19th and 20th century innovation. The name does not refer to classical antiquity, which used the term logic of Aristotle. In fact, classical logic was the reconciliation of Aristotle's logic, which dominated most of the last 2000 years, with the propositional Stoic logic. The two were sometimes seen as irreconcilable.\n\nLeibniz's calculus ratiocinator can be seen as foreshadowing classical logic. Bernard Bolzano has the understanding of existential import found in classical logic and not in Aristotle. Though he never questioned Aristotle, George Boole's algebraic reformulation of logic, so called Boolean logic, was a predecessor of modern mathematical logic and classical logic. William Stanley Jevons and John Venn, who also had the modern understanding of existential import, expanded Boole's system.\nthumb|180px|Begriffsschrift title page\nThe original first-order, classical logic is found in Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift. It has a wider application than Aristotle's logic, and is capable of expressing Aristotle's logic as a special case. It explains the quantifiers in terms of mathematical functions. It was also the first logic capable of dealing with the problem of multiple generality, for which Aristotle's system was impotent. Frege, who is considered the founder of analytic philosophy, invented it so as to show all of mathematics was derivable from logic, and make arithmetic rigorous as David Hilbert had done for geometry, the doctrine known as logicism in the foundations of mathematics. The notation Frege used never much caught on. Hugh MacColl published a variant of propositional logic two years prior.\n\nThe writings of Augustus De Morgan and Charles Sanders Peirce also pioneered classical logic with the logic of relations. Peirce influenced Giuseppe Peano and Ernst Schröder.\n\nClassical logic reached fruition in Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead's Principia Mathematica , and Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico Philosophicus. Russell and Whitehead were influenced by Peano (it uses his notation) and Frege, and sought to show mathematics was derived from logic. Wittgenstein was influenced by Frege and Russell, and initially considered the Tractatus to have solved all problems of philosophy.\n\nWillard Van Orman Quine insisted on classical, first-order logic as the true logic, saying higher-order logic was \"set theory in disguise\".\n\nJan Łukasiewicz pioneered non-classical logic. The results of Kurt Goedel and Alfred Tarski undermined the logicist project.\n\nGeneralized semantics\n\nWith the advent of algebraic logic it became apparent that classical propositional calculus admits other semantics. In Boolean-valued semantics (for classical propositional logic), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra; \"true\" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and \"false\" corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than \"true\" and \"false\".  The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the two-element algebra, which has no intermediate elements.\n\n References \n\n Further reading \n\n Warren Goldfard, \"Deductive Logic\", 1st edition, 2003, \n\n \nCategory:History of logic\nCategory:Logic"

In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations. A color space may be arbitrary, with particular colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches and corresponding assigned color names or numbers such as with the Pantone collection, or structured mathematically as with the NCS System, Adobe RGB and sRGB. A \"color model\" is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g. triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation. Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite \"footprint\", known as a gamut, and for a given color model this defines a color space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model. When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see.\n\nSince \"color space\" identifies a particular combination of the color model and the mapping function, the word is often used informally to identify a color model. However, even though identifying a color space automatically identifies the associated color model, such a usage is incorrect in a strict sense. For example, although several specific color spaces are based on the RGB color model, there is no such thing as the singular RGB color space.\n\nHistory\nthumb| Thomas Young and Hermann Helmholtz assumed that the eye's retina consists of three different kinds of light receptors for red, green and blue In 1802, Thomas Young postulated the existence of three types of photoreceptors (now known as cone cells) in the eye, each of which was sensitive to a particular range of visible light.Young, T., 1802. Bakerian Lecture: On the Theory of Light and Colours. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 92:12-48. doi: 10.1098/rstl. 1802.0004 Hermann von Helmholtz developed the Young–Helmholtz theory further in 1850: that the three types of cone photoreceptors could be classified as short-preferring (blue), middle-preferring (green), and long-preferring (red), according to their response to the wavelengths of light striking the retina. The relative strengths of the signals detected by the three types of cones are interpreted by the brain as a visible color. But it's not clear that they thought of colors as being points in color space.\n\nThe color-space concept was likely due to Hermann Grassmann, who developed it in two stages. First, he developed the idea of vector space, which allowed the algebraic representation of geometric concepts in -dimensional space.Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra Fearnley-Sander (1979) describes Grassmann's foundation of linear algebra  as follows:\n\nWith this conceptual background, in 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; it and its three color laws are still taught, as Grassmann's law.Grassmann, H. (1853). Zur Theorie der Farbenmischung. Poggendorffs Annalen der Physik, 89, 69–84. \n\nExamples\nthumb|right|A comparison of CMYK and RGB color models. This image demonstrates the difference between how colors will look on a computer monitor (RGB) compared to how they will reproduce in a CMYK print process.\n\nColors can be created in printing with color spaces based on the CMYK color model, using the subtractive primary colors of pigment (cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K)). To create a three-dimensional representation of a given color space, we can assign the amount of magenta color to the representation's X axis, the amount of cyan to its Y axis, and the amount of yellow to its Z axis. The resulting 3-D space provides a unique position for every possible color that can be created by combining those three pigments.\n\nColors can be created on computer monitors with color spaces based on the RGB color model, using the additive primary colors (red, green, and blue).  A three-dimensional representation would assign each of the three colors to the X, Y, and Z axes.  Note that colors generated on given monitor will be limited by the reproduction medium, such as the phosphor (in a CRT monitor) or filters and backlight (LCD monitor).\n\nAnother way of creating colors on a monitor is with an HSL or HSV color space, based on hue, saturation, brightness (value/brightness).  With such a space, the variables are assigned to cylindrical coordinates.\n\nMany color spaces can be represented as three-dimensional values in this manner, but some have more, or fewer dimensions, and some, such as Pantone, cannot be represented in this way at all.\n\nConversion\n\nColor space conversion is the translation of the representation of a color from one basis to another. This typically occurs in the context of converting an image that is represented in one color space to another color space, the goal being to make the translated image look as similar as possible to the original.\n\nRGB density\n\nThe RGB color model is implemented in different ways, depending on the capabilities of the system used. By far the most common general-used incarnation  is the 24-bit implementation, with 8 bits, or 256 discrete levels of color per channel. Any color space based on such a 24-bit RGB model is thus limited to a range of 256×256×256 ≈ 16.7 million colors. Some implementations use 16 bits per component for 48 bits total, resulting in the same gamut with a larger number of distinct colors. This is especially important when working with wide-gamut color spaces (where most of the more common colors are located relatively close together), or when a large number of digital filtering algorithms are used consecutively. The same principle applies for any color space based on the same color model, but implemented in different bit depths.\n\nLists\n\nCIE 1931 XYZ color space was one of the first attempts to produce a color space based on measurements of human color perception (earlier efforts were by James Clerk Maxwell, König & Dieterici, and Abney at Imperial College)William David Wright, 50 years of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer. Die Farbe, 29:4/6 (1981). and it is the basis for almost all other color spaces. The CIERGB color space is a linearly-related companion of CIE XYZ. Additional derivatives of CIE XYZ include the  CIELUV, CIEUVW, and CIELAB.\n\nGeneric\n\nthumbnail|200px|Additive color mixing: Three overlapping light bulbs in a vacuum, adding together to create white.\nthumbnail|200px|Subtractive color mixing: Three splotches of paint on white paper, subtracting together to turn the paper black.\n\nRGB uses additive color mixing, because it describes what kind of light needs to be emitted to produce a given color. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. RGBA is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency.\n\nCommon color spaces based on the RGB model include sRGB, Adobe RGB, ProPhoto RGB, scRGB, and CIE RGB.\n\nCMYK uses subtractive color mixing used in the printing process, because it describes what kind of inks need to be applied so the light reflected from the substrate and through the inks produces a given color. One starts with a white substrate (canvas, page, etc.), and uses ink to subtract color from white to create an image. CMYK stores ink values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. There are many CMYK color spaces for different sets of inks, substrates, and press characteristics (which change the dot gain or transfer function for each ink and thus change the appearance).\n\nYIQ was formerly used in NTSC (North America, Japan and elsewhere) television broadcasts for historical reasons. This system stores a luma value roughly analogous to (and sometimes incorrectly identified as)Charles Poynton, \"YUV and 'luminance' considered harmful: a plea for precise terminology in video,\" online,  author-edited version of Appendix A of Charles Poynton, Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces, Morgan–Kaufmann, 2003. onlineCharles Poynton, Constant Luminance, 2004 luminance, along with two chroma values as approximate representations of the relative amounts of blue and red in the color. It is similar to the YUV scheme used in most video capture systems and in PAL (Australia, Europe, except France, which uses SECAM) television, except that the YIQ color space is rotated 33° with respect to the YUV color space and the color axes are swapped. The YDbDr scheme used by SECAM television is rotated in another way. \n\nYPbPr is a scaled version of YUV. It is most commonly seen in its digital form, YCbCr, used widely in video and image compression schemes such as MPEG and JPEG.\n\nxvYCC is a new international digital video color space standard published by the IEC (IEC 61966-2-4). It is based on the ITU BT.601 and BT.709 standards but extends the gamut beyond the R/G/B primaries specified in those standards.\n\nHSV (hue, saturation, value), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) is often used by artists because it is often more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color components. HSV is a transformation of an RGB color space, and its components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB color space from which it was derived.\n\nHSL (hue, saturation, lightness/luminance), also known as HLS or HSI (hue, saturation, intensity) is quite similar to HSV, with \"lightness\" replacing \"brightness\". The difference is that the brightness of a pure color is equal to the brightness of white, while the lightness of a pure color is equal to the lightness of a medium gray.\n\nCommercial\n\n Munsell color system\n Pantone Matching System (PMS)\n Natural Color System (NCS)\n\nSpecial-purpose\n\n The RG Chromaticity space is used in computer vision applications.  It shows the color of light (red, yellow, green etc.), but not its intensity (dark, bright).\n The TSL color space (Tint, Saturation and Luminance) is used in face detection.\n\nObsolete\n\nEarly color spaces had two components. They largely ignored blue light because the added complexity of a 3-component process provided only a marginal increase in fidelity when compared to the jump from monochrome to 2-component color.\n\n RG for early Technicolor film\n RGK  for early color printing\n\nAbsolute color space\n\nIn color science, there are two meanings of the term absolute color space:\n A color space in which the perceptual difference between colors is directly related to distances between colors as represented by points in the color space.\n A color space in which colors are unambiguous, that is, where the interpretations of colors in the space are colorimetrically defined without reference to external factors.\n\nIn this article, we concentrate on the second definition.\n\nCIEXYZ, sRGB, and ICtCp are examples of absolute color spaces, as opposed to a generic RGB color space.\n\nA non-absolute color space can be made absolute by defining its relationship to absolute colorimetric quantities. For instance, if the red, green, and blue colors in a monitor are measured exactly, together with other properties of the monitor, then RGB values on that monitor can be considered as absolute.  The L*a*b* is sometimes referred to as absolute, though it also needs a white point specification to make it so.\n\nA popular way to make a color space like RGB into an absolute color is to define an ICC profile, which contains the attributes of the RGB. This is not the only way to express an absolute color, but it is the standard in many industries. RGB colors defined by widely accepted profiles include sRGB and Adobe RGB. The process of adding an ICC profile to a graphic or document is sometimes called tagging or embedding; tagging therefore marks the absolute meaning of colors in that graphic or document.\n\nConversion\n\nA color in one absolute color space can be converted into another absolute color space, and back again, in general; however, some color spaces may have gamut limitations, and converting colors that lie outside that gamut will not produce correct results. There are also likely to be rounding errors, especially if the popular range of only 256 distinct values per component (8-bit color) is used.\n\nOne part of the definition of an absolute color space is the viewing conditions. The same color, viewed under different natural or artificial lighting conditions, will look different. Those involved professionally with color matching may use viewing rooms, lit by standardized lighting.\n\nOccasionally, there are precise rules for converting between non-absolute color spaces. For example, HSL and HSV spaces are defined as mappings of RGB. Both are non-absolute, but the conversion between them should maintain the same color. However, in general, converting between two non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to CMYK) or between absolute and non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to L*a*b*) is almost a meaningless concept.\n\nArbitrary spaces\nA different method of defining absolute color spaces is familiar to many consumers as the swatch card, used to select paint, fabrics, and the like. This is a way of agreeing a color between two parties. A more standardized method of defining absolute colors is the Pantone Matching System, a proprietary system that includes swatch cards and recipes that commercial printers can use to make inks that are a particular color.\n\nSee also\n Color theory\n Color model\n List of colors\n\nReferences\n\n3. www.iscc.org/aic2001/abstracts/poster/Zoch.doc\n\nExternal links\n\n Color FAQ, Charles Poynton\n FAQ about color physics, Stephen Westland\n Color Science, Dan Bruton\n Color Spaces, Rolf G.

      "text": "David Hilbert  (;\"Hilbert\". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 23 January 1862 – 14 February 1943) was a German mathematician and one of the most influential and universal mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Hilbert discovered and developed a broad range of fundamental ideas in many areas, including invariant theory, calculus of variations, commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, the foundations of geometry, spectral theory of operators and its application to integral equations, mathematical physics, and foundations of mathematics (particularly proof theory).\n\nHilbert adopted and warmly defended Georg Cantor's set theory and transfinite numbers. A famous example of his leadership in mathematics is his 1900 presentation of a collection of problems that set the course for much of the mathematical research of the 20th century.\n\nHilbert and his students contributed significantly to establishing rigor and developed important tools used in modern mathematical physics. Hilbert is known as one of the founders of proof theory and mathematical logic, as well as for being among the first to distinguish between mathematics and metamathematics.\n\nLife\n\nEarly life and education\nHilbert, the first of two children of Otto and Maria Therese (Erdtmann) Hilbert, was born in the Province of Prussia, Kingdom of Prussia, either in Königsberg (according to Hilbert's own statement) or in Wehlau (known since 1946 as Znamensk) near Königsberg where his father worked at the time of his birth.Reid 1996, pp. 1–2; also on p. 8, Reid notes that there is some ambiguity as to exactly where Hilbert was born. Hilbert himself stated that he was born in Königsberg.\n\nIn late 1872, Hilbert entered the Friedrichskolleg Gymnasium (Collegium fridericianum, the same school that Immanuel Kant had attended 140 years before); but, after an unhappy period, he transferred to (late 1879) and graduated from (early 1880) the more science-oriented Wilhelm Gymnasium.Reid 1996, pp. 4–7. Upon graduation, in autumn 1880, Hilbert enrolled at the University of Königsberg, the \"Albertina\". In early 1882, Hermann Minkowski (two years younger than Hilbert and also a native of Königsberg but had gone to Berlin for three semesters),Reid 1996, p. 11. returned to Königsberg and entered the university. Hilbert developed a lifelong friendship with the shy, gifted Minkowski.Reid 1996, p. 12.\n\nCareer\nIn 1884, Adolf Hurwitz arrived from Göttingen as an Extraordinarius (i.e., an associate professor). An intense and fruitful scientific exchange among the three began, and Minkowski and Hilbert especially would exercise a reciprocal influence over each other at various times in their scientific careers. Hilbert obtained his doctorate in 1885, with a dissertation, written under Ferdinand von Lindemann, titled Über invariante Eigenschaften spezieller binärer Formen, insbesondere der Kugelfunktionen (\"On the invariant properties of special binary forms, in particular the spherical harmonic functions\").\n\nHilbert remained at the University of Königsberg as a Privatdozent (senior lecturer) from 1886 to 1895.  In 1895, as a result of intervention on his behalf by Felix Klein, he obtained the position of Professor of Mathematics at the University of Göttingen. During the Klein and Hilbert years, Göttingen became the preeminent institution in the mathematical world. He remained there for the rest of his life.\n\nthumb|right|The Mathematical Institute in Göttingen. Its new building, constructed with funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, was opened by Hilbert and Courant in 1930.\n\nGöttingen school\nthumb|left|Portrait of David Hilbert in the 1900s, artist Anna Gorban, the cover image of the theme issue ‘Hilbert's sixth problem, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 2018, 376 (2118).\nAmong Hilbert's students were Hermann Weyl, chess champion Emanuel Lasker, Ernst Zermelo, and Carl Gustav Hempel. John von Neumann was his assistant. At the University of Göttingen, Hilbert was surrounded by a social circle of some of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century, such as Emmy Noether and Alonzo Church.\n\nAmong his 69 Ph.D. students in Göttingen were many who later became famous mathematicians, including (with date of thesis): Otto Blumenthal (1898), Felix Bernstein (1901), Hermann Weyl (1908), Richard Courant (1910), Erich Hecke (1910), Hugo Steinhaus (1911), and Wilhelm Ackermann (1925). Between 1902 and 1939 Hilbert was editor of the Mathematische Annalen, the leading mathematical journal of the time.\n\nLater years\n\nAround 1925, Hilbert developed pernicious anemia, a then-untreatable vitamin deficiency whose primary symptom is exhaustion; his assistant Eugene Wigner described him as subject to \"enormous fatigue\" and how he \"seemed quite old\", and that even after eventually being diagnosed and treated, he \"was hardly a scientist after 1925, and certainly not a Hilbert.\"1992 (as told to Andrew Szanton). The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner. Plenum. \n\nHilbert lived to see the Nazis purge many of the prominent faculty members at University of Göttingen in 1933. (Hilbert's colleagues exiled) Those forced out included Hermann Weyl (who had taken Hilbert's chair when he retired in 1930), Emmy Noether and Edmund Landau. One who had to leave Germany, Paul Bernays, had collaborated with Hilbert in mathematical logic, and co-authored with him the important book Grundlagen der Mathematik (which eventually appeared in two volumes, in 1934 and 1939). This was a sequel to the Hilbert-Ackermann book Principles of Mathematical Logic from 1928. Hermann Weyl's successor was Helmut Hasse.\n\nAbout a year later, Hilbert attended a banquet and was seated next to the new Minister of Education, Bernhard Rust. Rust asked whether \"the Mathematical Institute really suffered so much because of the departure of the Jews\". Hilbert replied,\n\"Suffered? It doesn't exist any longer, does it!\"Eckart Menzler-Trott: Gentzens Problem. Mathematische Logik im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland., Birkhäuser, 2001, , Birkhäuser; Auflage: 2001 p. 142.Hajo G. Meyer: Tragisches Schicksal. Das deutsche Judentum und die Wirkung historischer Kräfte: Eine Übung in angewandter Geschichtsphilosophie, Frank & Timme, 2008, , p. 202.\n\nDeath\nthumb|Hilbert's tomb:Wir müssen wissenWir werden wissen\nBy the time Hilbert died in 1943, the Nazis had nearly completely restaffed the university, as many of the former faculty had either been Jewish or married to Jews. Hilbert's funeral was attended by fewer than a dozen people, only two of whom were fellow academics, among them Arnold Sommerfeld, a theoretical physicist and also a native of Königsberg.Reid 1996, p. 213. News of his death only became known to the wider world six months after he died.\n\nThe epitaph on his tombstone in Göttingen consists of the famous lines he spoke at the conclusion of his retirement address to the Society of German Scientists and Physicians on 8 September 1930. The words were given in response to the Latin maxim: \"Ignoramus et ignorabimus\" or \"We do not know, we shall not know\":Reid 1996, p. 192\n\nWir müssen wissen.\nWir werden wissen.\n\nIn English:\n We must know.\n We will know.\n\nThe day before Hilbert pronounced these phrases at the 1930 annual meeting of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, Kurt Gödel—in a round table discussion during the Conference on Epistemology held jointly with the Society meetings—tentatively announced the first expression of his incompleteness theorem.\"The Conference on Epistemology of the Exact Sciences ran for three days, from 5 to 7 September\" (Dawson 1997:68). \"It ... was held in conjunction with and just before the ninety-first annual meeting of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians ... and the sixth Assembly of German Physicists and Mathematicians.... Gödel's contributed talk took place on Saturday, 6 September [1930], from 3 until 3:20 in the afternoon, and on Sunday the meeting concluded with a round table discussion of the first day's addresses. During the latter event, without warning and almost offhandedly, Gödel quietly announced that \"one can even give examples of propositions (and in fact of those of the type of Goldbach or Fermat) that, while contentually true, are unprovable in the formal system of classical mathematics [153]\" (Dawson:69) \"... As it happened, Hilbert himself was present at Königsberg, though apparently not at the Conference on Epistemology. The day after the roundtable discussion he delivered the opening address before the Society of German Scientists and Physicians – his famous lecture Naturerkennen und Logik (Logic and the knowledge of nature), at the end of which he declared: 'For the mathematician there is no Ignorabimus, and, in my opinion, not at all for natural science either. ... The true reason why [no-one] has succeeded in finding an unsolvable problem is, in my opinion, that there is no unsolvable problem. In contrast to the foolish Ignorabimus, our credo avers: We must know, We shall know [159]'\"(Dawson:71). Gödel's paper was received on November 17, 1930 (cf Reid p. 197, van Heijenoort 1976:592) and published on 25 March 1931 (Dawson 1997:74). But Gödel had given a talk about it beforehand... \"An abstract had been presented on October 1930 to the Vienna Academy of Sciences by Hans Hahn\" (van Heijenoort:592); this abstract and the full paper both appear in van Heijenoort:583ff.  Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that even elementary axiomatic systems such as Peano arithmetic are either self-contradicting or contain logical propositions that are impossible to prove or disprove.\n\nPersonal life\nthumb|Käthe Hilbert with Constantin Carathéodory, before 1932\nIn 1892, Hilbert married Käthe Jerosch (1864–1945), \"the daughter of a Königsberg merchant, an outspoken young lady with an independence of mind that matched his own\".Reid 1996, p. 36. While at Königsberg they had their one child, Franz Hilbert (1893–1969).\n\nHilbert's son Franz suffered throughout his life from an undiagnosed mental illness. His inferior intellect was a terrible disappointment to his father and this misfortune was a matter of distress to the mathematicians and students at Göttingen.Reid 1996, p. 139.\n\nHilbert considered the mathematician Hermann Minkowski to be his \"best and truest friend\".Reid 1996, p. 121.\n\nHilbert was baptized and raised a Calvinist in the Prussian Evangelical Church.The Hilberts had by this time left the Reformed Protestant Church in which they had been baptized and married. - Reid 1996, p.91 He later on left the Church and became an agnostic. He also argued that mathematical truth was independent of the existence of God or other a priori assumptions.\"Mathematics is a presuppositionless science. To found it I do not need God, as does Kronecker, or the assumption of a special faculty of our understanding attuned to the principle of mathematical induction, as does Poincaré, or the primal intuition of Brouwer, or, finally, as do Russell and Whitehead, axioms of infinity, reducibility, or completeness, which in fact are actual, contentual assumptions that cannot be compensated for by consistency proofs.\" David Hilbert, Die Grundlagen der Mathematik, Hilbert's program, 22C:096, University of Iowa.\n\nHilbert solves Gordan's Problem\nHilbert's first work on invariant functions led him to the demonstration in 1888 of his famous finiteness theorem. Twenty years earlier, Paul Gordan had demonstrated the theorem of the finiteness of generators for binary forms using a complex computational approach. Attempts to generalize his method to functions with more than two variables failed because of the enormous difficulty of the calculations involved. In order to solve what had become known in some circles as Gordan's Problem, Hilbert realized that it was necessary to take a completely different path. As a result, he demonstrated Hilbert's basis theorem, showing the existence of a finite set of generators, for the invariants of quantics in any number of variables, but in an abstract form. That is, while demonstrating the existence of such a set, it was not a constructive proof — it did not display \"an object\" — but rather, it was an existence proofConstance Reid 1996, pp. 36–37. and relied on use of the law of excluded middle in an infinite extension.\n\nHilbert sent his results to the Mathematische Annalen. Gordan, the house expert on the theory of invariants for the Mathematische Annalen, could not appreciate the revolutionary nature of Hilbert's theorem and rejected the article, criticizing the exposition because it was insufficiently comprehensive. His comment was:\n\nDas ist nicht Mathematik. Das ist Theologie.\n(This is not Mathematics. This is Theology.)Reid 1996, p. 34.\n\nKlein, on the other hand, recognized the importance of the work, and guaranteed that it would be published without any alterations. Encouraged by Klein, Hilbert extended his method in a second article, providing estimations on the maximum degree of the minimum set of generators, and he sent it once more to the Annalen. After having read the manuscript, Klein wrote to him, saying:\n\nWithout doubt this is the most important work on general algebra that the Annalen has ever published.Rowe, p. 195\n\nLater, after the usefulness of Hilbert's method was universally recognized, Gordan himself would say:\n\nI have convinced myself that even theology has its merits.Reid 1996, p. 37.\n\nFor all his successes, the nature of his proof stirred up more trouble than Hilbert could have imagined at the time. Although Kronecker had conceded, Hilbert would later respond to others' similar criticisms that \"many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea\" — in other words (to quote Reid): \"Through a proof of existence, Hilbert had been able to obtain a construction\"; \"the proof\" (i.e. the symbols on the page) was \"the object\". Not all were convinced. While Kronecker would die soon afterwards, his constructivist philosophy would continue with the young Brouwer and his developing intuitionist \"school\", much to Hilbert's torment in his later years.cf. Reid 1996, pp. 148–149. Indeed, Hilbert would lose his \"gifted pupil\" Weyl to intuitionism — \"Hilbert was disturbed by his former student's fascination with the ideas of Brouwer, which aroused in Hilbert the memory of Kronecker\".Reid 1996, p. 148. Brouwer the intuitionist in particular opposed the use of the Law of Excluded Middle over infinite sets (as Hilbert had used it). Hilbert would respond:\n\nTaking the Principle of the Excluded Middle from the mathematician ... is the same as ... prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists.Reid 1996, p. 150.\n\nAxiomatization of geometry\n\nThe text Grundlagen der Geometrie (tr.: Foundations of Geometry) published by Hilbert in 1899 proposes a formal set, called Hilbert's axioms, substituting for the traditional axioms of Euclid. They avoid weaknesses identified in those of Euclid, whose works at the time were still used textbook-fashion. It is difficult to specify the axioms used by Hilbert without referring to the publication history of the Grundlagen since Hilbert changed and modified them several times. The original monograph was quickly followed by a French translation, in which Hilbert added V.2, the Completeness Axiom. An English translation, authorized by Hilbert, was made by E.J. Townsend and copyrighted in 1902.G. B. Mathews(1909) The Foundations of Geometry from Nature 80:394,5 (#2066) This translation incorporated the changes made in the French translation and so is considered to be a translation of the 2nd edition. Hilbert continued to make changes in the text and several editions appeared in German. The 7th edition was the last to appear in Hilbert's lifetime. New editions followed the 7th, but the main text was essentially not revised.\n\nHilbert's approach signaled the shift to the modern axiomatic method.  In this, Hilbert was anticipated by Moritz Pasch's work from 1882.  Axioms are not taken as self-evident truths. Geometry may treat things, about which we have powerful intuitions, but it is not necessary to assign any explicit meaning to the undefined concepts. The elements, such as point, line, plane, and others, could be substituted, as Hilbert is reported to have said to Schoenflies and Kötter, by tables, chairs, glasses of beer and other such objects. Here: p.402-403 It is their defined relationships that are discussed.\n\nHilbert first enumerates the undefined concepts: point, line, plane, lying on (a relation between points and lines, points and planes, and lines and planes), betweenness, congruence of pairs of points (line segments), and congruence of angles. The axioms unify both the plane geometry and solid geometry of Euclid in a single system.\n\nThe 23 problems\n\nHilbert put forth a most influential list of 23 unsolved problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. This is generally reckoned as the most successful and deeply considered compilation of open problems ever to be produced by an individual mathematician.\n\nAfter re-working the foundations of classical geometry, Hilbert could have extrapolated to the rest of mathematics. His approach differed, however, from the later 'foundationalist' Russell-Whitehead or 'encyclopedist' Nicolas Bourbaki, and from his contemporary Giuseppe Peano. The mathematical community as a whole could enlist in problems, which he had identified as crucial aspects of the areas of mathematics he took to be key.\n\nThe problem set was launched as a talk \"The Problems of Mathematics\" presented during the course of the Second International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris. The introduction of the speech that Hilbert gave said:\n\nWho among us would not be happy to lift the veil behind which is hidden the future; to gaze at the coming developments of our science and at the secrets of its development in the centuries to come? What will be the ends toward which the spirit of future generations of mathematicians will tend? What methods, what new facts will the new century reveal in the vast and rich field of mathematical thought?, archived from [www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs121/handouts/Hilbert.pdf]\n\nHe presented fewer than half the problems at the Congress, which were published in the acts of the Congress. In a subsequent publication, he extended the panorama, and arrived at the formulation of the now-canonical 23 Problems of Hilbert. See also Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem. The full text is important, since the exegesis of the questions still can be a matter of inevitable debate, whenever it is asked how many have been solved.\n\nSome of these were solved within a short time. Others have been discussed throughout the 20th century, with a few now taken to be unsuitably open-ended to come to closure. Some even continue to this day to remain a challenge for mathematicians.\n\nFormalism\nIn an account that had become standard by the mid-century, Hilbert's problem set was also a kind of manifesto, that opened the way for the development of the formalist school, one of three major schools of mathematics of the 20th century. According to the formalist, mathematics is manipulation of symbols according to agreed upon formal rules. It is therefore an autonomous activity of thought.  There is, however, room to doubt whether Hilbert's own views were simplistically formalist in this sense.\n\nHilbert's program\n\nIn 1920 he proposed explicitly a research project (in metamathematics, as it was then termed) that became known as Hilbert's program. He wanted mathematics to be formulated on a solid and complete logical foundation. He believed that in principle this could be done, by showing that:\n\n all of mathematics follows from a correctly chosen finite system of axioms; and\n that some such axiom system is provably consistent through some means such as the epsilon calculus.\n\nHe seems to have had both technical and philosophical reasons for formulating this proposal. It affirmed his dislike of what had become known as the ignorabimus, still an active issue in his time in German thought, and traced back in that formulation to Emil du Bois-Reymond.\n\nThis program is still recognizable in the most popular philosophy of mathematics, where it is usually called formalism. For example, the Bourbaki group adopted a watered-down and selective version of it as adequate to the requirements of their twin projects of (a) writing encyclopedic foundational works, and (b) supporting the axiomatic method as a research tool. This approach has been successful and influential in relation with Hilbert's work in algebra and functional analysis, but has failed to engage in the same way with his interests in physics and logic.\n\nHilbert wrote in 1919:\n\nWe are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules.  Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise.Hilbert, D. (1919-20), Natur und Mathematisches Erkennen: Vorlesungen, gehalten 1919-1920 in G\\\"ottingen. Nach der Ausarbeitung von Paul Bernays (Edited and with an English introduction by David E. Rowe), Basel, Birkh\\\"auser (1992).\n\nHilbert published his views on the foundations of mathematics in the 2-volume work Grundlagen der Mathematik.\n\nGödel's work\nHilbert and the mathematicians who worked with him in his enterprise were committed to the project. His attempt to support axiomatized mathematics with definitive principles, which could banish theoretical uncertainties, ended in failure.\n\nGödel demonstrated that any non-contradictory formal system, which was comprehensive enough to include at least arithmetic, cannot demonstrate its completeness by way of its own axioms. In 1931 his incompleteness theorem showed that Hilbert's grand plan was impossible as stated. The second point cannot in any reasonable way be combined with the first point, as long as the axiom system is genuinely finitary.\n\nNevertheless, the subsequent achievements of proof theory at the very least clarified consistency as it relates to theories of central concern to mathematicians. Hilbert's work had started logic on this course of clarification; the need to understand Gödel's work then led to the development of recursion theory and then mathematical logic as an autonomous discipline in the 1930s. The basis for later theoretical computer science, in the work of Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, also grew directly out of this 'debate'.\n\nFunctional analysis\nAround 1909, Hilbert dedicated himself to the study of differential and integral equations; his work had direct consequences for important parts of modern functional analysis. In order to carry out these studies, Hilbert introduced the concept of an infinite dimensional Euclidean space, later called Hilbert space. His work in this part of analysis provided the basis for important contributions to the mathematics of physics in the next two decades, though from an unanticipated direction.\nLater on, Stefan Banach amplified the concept, defining Banach spaces. Hilbert spaces are an important class of objects in the area of functional analysis, particularly of the spectral theory of self-adjoint linear operators, that grew up around it during the 20th century.\n\nPhysics\nUntil 1912, Hilbert was almost exclusively a \"pure\" mathematician.  When planning a visit from Bonn, where he was immersed in studying physics, his fellow mathematician and friend Hermann Minkowski joked he had to spend 10 days in quarantine before being able to visit Hilbert.  In fact, Minkowski seems responsible for most of Hilbert's physics investigations prior to 1912, including their joint seminar in the subject in 1905.\n\nIn 1912, three years after his friend's death, Hilbert turned his focus to the subject almost exclusively.  He arranged to have a \"physics tutor\" for himself.Reid 1996, p. 129.  He started studying kinetic gas theory and moved on to elementary radiation theory and the molecular theory of matter.  Even after the war started in 1914, he continued seminars and classes where the works of Albert Einstein and others were followed closely.\n\nBy 1907 Einstein had framed the fundamentals of the theory of gravity, but then struggled for nearly 8 years with a confounding problem of putting the theory into final form.Isaacson 2007:218 By early summer 1915, Hilbert's interest in physics had focused on general relativity, and he invited Einstein to Göttingen to deliver a week of lectures on the subject.Sauer 1999, Folsing 1998, Isaacson 2007:212 Einstein received an enthusiastic reception at Göttingen.Isaacson 2007:213 Over the summer Einstein learned that Hilbert was also working on the field equations and redoubled his own efforts. During November 1915 Einstein published several papers culminating in \"The Field Equations of Gravitation\" (see Einstein field equations).In time, associating the gravitational field equations with Hilbert's name became less and less common. A noticeable exception is P. Jordan (Schwerkraft und Weltall, Braunschweig, Vieweg, 1952), who called the equations of gravitation in the vacuum the Einstein–Hilbert equations. (Leo Corry, David Hilbert and the Axiomatization of Physics, p. 437) Nearly simultaneously David Hilbert published \"The Foundations of Physics\", an axiomatic derivation of the field equations (see Einstein–Hilbert action). Hilbert fully credited Einstein as the originator of the theory, and no public priority dispute concerning the field equations ever arose between the two men during their lives.Since 1971 there have been some spirited and scholarly discussions about which of the two men first presented the now accepted form of the field equations. \"Hilbert freely admitted, and frequently stated in lectures, that the great idea was Einstein's.\"Every boy in the streets of Gottingen understands more about four dimensional geometry than Einstein,\" he once remarked. \"Yet, in spite of that, Einstein did the work and not the mathematicians\" (Reid 1996, pp. 141–142, also Isaacson 2007:222 quoting Thorne p. 119). See more at priority.\n\nAdditionally, Hilbert's work anticipated and assisted several advances in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. His work was a key aspect of Hermann Weyl and John von Neumann's work on the mathematical equivalence of Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Erwin Schrödinger's wave equation and his namesake Hilbert space plays an important part in quantum theory.  In 1926 von Neumann showed that if atomic states were understood as vectors in Hilbert space, then they would correspond with both Schrödinger's wave function theory and Heisenberg's matrices.In 1926, the year after the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory by Max Born and Werner Heisenberg, the mathematician John von Neumann became an assistant to David Hilbert at Göttingen.  When von Neumann left in 1932, von Neumann's book on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, based on Hilbert's mathematics, was published under the title  Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik.  See: Norman Macrae, John von Neumann:  The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer, Game Theory, Nuclear Deterrence, and Much More (Reprinted by the American Mathematical Society, 1999) and Reid 1996.\n\nThroughout this immersion in physics, Hilbert worked on putting rigor into the mathematics of physics.  While highly dependent on higher mathematics, physicists tended to be \"sloppy\" with it.  To a \"pure\" mathematician like Hilbert, this was both \"ugly\" and difficult to understand.  As he began to understand physics and how physicists were using mathematics, he developed a coherent mathematical theory for what he found, most importantly in the area of integral equations.  When his colleague Richard Courant wrote the now classic Methoden der mathematischen Physik (Methods of Mathematical Physics) including some of Hilbert's ideas, he added Hilbert's name as author even though Hilbert had not directly contributed to the writing.  Hilbert said \"Physics is too hard for physicists\", implying that the necessary mathematics was generally beyond them; the Courant-Hilbert book made it easier for them.\n\nNumber theory\nHilbert unified the field of algebraic number theory with his 1897 treatise Zahlbericht (literally \"report on numbers\"). He also resolved a significant number-theory problem formulated by Waring in 1770.  As with the finiteness theorem, he used an existence proof that shows there must be solutions for the problem rather than providing a mechanism to produce the answers.Reid 1996, p. 114  He then had little more to publish on the subject; but the emergence of Hilbert modular forms in the dissertation of a student means his name is further attached to a major area.\n\nHe made a series of conjectures on class field theory. The concepts were highly influential, and his own contribution lives on in the names of the Hilbert class field and of the Hilbert symbol of local class field theory. Results were mostly proved by 1930, after work by Teiji Takagi.This work established Takagi as Japan's first mathematician of international stature.\n\nHilbert did not work in the central areas of analytic number theory, but his name has become known for the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture, for reasons that are anecdotal.\n\nWorks\nHis collected works (Gesammelte Abhandlungen) have been published several times. The original versions of his papers contained \"many technical errors of varying degree\";Reid, chap.13 when the collection was first published, the errors were corrected and it was found that this could be done without major changes in the statements of the theorems, with one exception—a claimed proof of the continuum hypothesis.Page 284f in: <ref name=\"Rota97\">Rota G.-C.

      "title": "Double-negation translation",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-negation_translation",
      "text": "In proof theory, a discipline within mathematical logic, double-negation translation, sometimes called negative translation, is a general approach for embedding classical logic into intuitionistic logic, typically by translating formulas to formulas which are classically equivalent but intuitionistically inequivalent. Particular instances of double-negation translation include Glivenko's translation for propositional logic, and the Gödel–Gentzen translation and Kuroda's translation for first-order logic.\n\n Propositional logic \nThe easiest double-negation translation to describe comes from Glivenko's theorem, proved by Valery Glivenko in 1929. It maps each classical formula φ to its double negation ¬¬φ.\n\nGlivenko's theorem states:\nIf φ is a propositional formula, then φ is a classical tautology if and only if ¬¬φ is an intuitionistic tautology.\n\nGlivenko's theorem implies the more general statement:\nIf T is a set of propositional formulas, T* a set consisting of the doubly negated formulas of T, and φ a propositional formula, then T ⊢ φ in classical logic if and only if T* ⊢ ¬¬φ in intuitionistic logic.\n\nIn particular, a set of propositional formulas is intuitionistically consistent if and only if it is classically satisfiable.\n\n First-order logic \n\nThe Gödel–Gentzen translation (named after Kurt Gödel and Gerhard Gentzen) associates with each formula φ in a first-order language another formula φN, which is defined inductively:\n\n If φ is atomic, then φN is ¬¬φ\n (φ ∧ θ)N is φN ∧ θN\n (φ ∨ θ)N is ¬(¬φN ∧ ¬θN)\n (φ → θ)N is φN → θN\n (¬φ)N is ¬φN \n (∀x φ)N is ∀x φN \n (∃x φ)N is ¬∀x ¬φN \n\nThis translation has the property that φN is classically equivalent to φ. The fundamental soundness theorem (Avigad and Feferman 1998, p. 342; Buss 1998 p. 66) states:\nIf T is a set of axioms and φ is a formula, then T proves φ using classical logic if and only if TN proves φN using intuitionistic logic.\n\nHere TN consists of the double-negation translations of the formulas in T.\n\nA sentence φ may not imply its negative translation φN in intuitionistic first-order logic.  Troelstra and Van Dalen (1988, Ch. 2, Sec. 3) give a description (due to Leivant) of formulas that do imply their Gödel–Gentzen translation.\n\n Variants \n\nThere are several alternative definitions of the negative translation. They are all provably equivalent in intuitionistic logic, but may be easier to apply in particular contexts.\n\nOne possibility is to change the clauses for disjunction and existential quantifier to\n (φ ∨ θ)N is ¬¬(φN ∨ θN)\n (∃x φ)N is ¬¬∃x φN \nThen the translation can be succinctly described as: prefix ¬¬ to every atomic formula, disjunction, and existential quantifier.\n\nAnother possibility (known as Kuroda's translation) is to construct φN from φ by putting ¬¬ before the whole formula and after every universal quantifier. Notice that this reduces to the simple ¬¬φ translation if φ is propositional.\n\nIt is also possible to define φN by prefixing ¬¬ before every subformula of φ, as done by Kolmogorov. Such a translation is the logical counterpart to the call-by-name continuation-passing style translation of functional programming languages along the lines of the Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and programs.\n\n Results \n\nThe double-negation translation was used by Gödel (1933) to study the relationship between classical and intuitionistic theories of the natural numbers (\"arithmetic\"). He obtains the following result:\nIf a formula φ is provable from the axioms of Peano arithmetic then φN is provable from the axioms of intuitionistic Heyting arithmetic.\n\nThis result shows that if Heyting arithmetic is consistent then so is Peano arithmetic. This is because a contradictory formula  is interpreted as , which is still contradictory. Moreover, the proof of the relationship is entirely constructive, giving a way to transform a proof of  in Peano arithmetic into a proof of  in Heyting arithmetic. (By combining the double-negation translation with the Friedman translation, it is in fact possible to prove that Peano arithmetic is Π02-conservative over Heyting arithmetic.)\n\nThe propositional mapping of φ to ¬¬φ does not extend to a sound translation of first-order logic, because  is not a theorem of intuitionistic predicate logic. This explains why φN has to be defined in a more complicated way in the first-order case.\n\n See also \n Dialectica interpretation\n\n References \n\n J. Avigad and S.

      "title": "Empty set",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set",
      "text": "thumb|upright=0.4|The empty set is the set containing no elements.\nIn mathematics, the empty set is the unique set having no elements; its size or cardinality (count of elements in a set) is zero. Some axiomatic set theories ensure that the empty set exists by including an axiom of empty set; in other theories, its existence can be deduced. Many possible properties of sets are vacuously true for the empty set.\n\nIn some textbooks and popularizations, the empty set is referred to as the \"null set\".  However null set is a distinct notion within the context of measure theory. In that setting, it describes a set of measure zero; such a set is not necessarily empty.  The empty set may also be called the void set.  Common notations for the empty set include \"{}\", \"\", and \"∅\".\n\nNotation\n\nthumb|upright=0.4|A symbol for the empty set\nCommon notations for the empty set include \"{}\", \"\", and \"∅\". The latter two symbols were introduced by the Bourbaki group (specifically André Weil) in 1939, inspired by the letter Ø in the Norwegian and Danish alphabets (and not related in any way to the Greek letter Φ).Earliest Uses of Symbols of Set Theory and Logic. In the past, \"0\" was occasionally used as a symbol for the empty set, but this is now considered to be an improper use of notation.\n\nThe symbol ∅ is available at Unicode point U+2205.Unicode Standard 5.2 It can be coded in HTML as &empty; and as &#8709;. It can be coded in LaTeX as \\varnothing. The symbol  is coded in LaTeX as \\emptyset.\n\n Properties \nIn standard axiomatic set theory, by the principle of extensionality, two sets are equal if they have the same elements; therefore there can be only one set with no elements. Hence there is but one empty set, and we speak of \"the empty set\" rather than \"an empty set\".\n\nThe mathematical symbols employed below are explained here.\n\nFor any set A:\n The empty set is a subset of A:\n\n The union of A with the empty set is A:\n\n The intersection of A with the empty set is the empty set:\n\n The Cartesian product of A and the empty set is the empty set:\n\nThe empty set has the following properties:\n Its only subset is the empty set itself:\n\n The power set of the empty set is the set containing only the empty set:\n\n Its number of elements (that is, its cardinality) is zero:\n\nThe connection between the empty set and zero goes further, however: in the standard set-theoretic definition of natural numbers, sets are used to model the natural numbers. In this context, zero is modelled by the empty set.\n\nFor any property:\n For every element of  the property holds (vacuous truth);\n There is no element of  for which the property holds.\n\nConversely, if for some property and some set V, the following two statements hold:\n For every element of V the property holds;\n There is no element of V for which the property holds,\nthen .\n\nBy the definition of subset, the empty set is a subset of any set A. That is, every element x of  belongs to A. Indeed, if it were not true that every element of  is in A then there would be at least one element of  that is not present in A. Since there are no elements of  at all, there is no element of  that is not in A. Any statement that begins \"for every element of \" is not making any substantive claim; it is a vacuous truth. This is often paraphrased as \"everything is true of the elements of the empty set.\"\n\n Operations on the empty set \n\nWhen speaking of the sum of the elements of a finite set, one is inevitably led to the convention that the sum of the elements of the empty set is zero. The reason for this is that zero is the identity element for addition. Similarly, the product of the elements of the empty set should be considered to be one (see empty product), since one is the identity element for multiplication.\n\nA derangement is a permutation of a set without fixed points.  The empty set can be considered a derangement of itself, because it has only one permutation (), and it is vacuously true that no element (of the empty set) can be found that retains its original position.\n\nIn other areas of mathematics\n Extended real numbers \n\nSince the empty set has no members, when it is considered as a subset of any ordered set, then every member of that set will be an upper bound and lower bound for the empty set. For example, when considered as a subset of the real numbers, with its usual ordering, represented by the real number line, every real number is both an upper and lower bound for the empty set.Bruckner, A.N., Bruckner, J.B., and Thomson, B.S., 2008. Elementary Real Analysis, 2nd ed. Prentice Hall. P. 9. When considered as a subset of the extended reals formed by adding two \"numbers\" or \"points\" to the real numbers, namely negative infinity, denoted  which is defined to be less than every other extended real number, and positive infinity, denoted  which is defined to be greater than every other extended real number, then: \n\nand\n\nThat is, the least upper bound (sup or supremum) of the empty set is negative infinity, while the greatest lower bound (inf or infimum) is positive infinity. By analogy with the above, in the domain of the extended reals, negative infinity is the identity element for the maximum and supremum operators, while positive infinity is the identity element for minimum and infimum.\n\n Topology \nIn any topological space X, the empty set is open by definition, as is X. Since the complement of an open set is closed and the empty set and X are complements of each other, the empty set is also closed, making it a clopen set. Moreover, the empty set is compact by the fact that every finite set is compact.\n\nThe closure of the empty set is empty. This is known as \"preservation of nullary unions.\"\n\n Category theory \nIf A is a set, then there exists precisely one function f from Ø to A, the empty function. As a result, the empty set is the unique initial object of the category of sets and functions.\n\nThe empty set can be turned into a topological space, called the empty space, in just one way: by defining the empty set to be open. This empty topological space is the unique initial object in the category of topological spaces with continuous maps. In fact, it is a strict initial object: only the empty set has a function to the empty set.\n\n Set theory \nIn the von Neumann construction of the ordinals, 0 is defined as the empty set, and the successor of an ordinal is defined as . Thus, we have , , , and so on.  The von Neumann construction, along with the axiom of infinity, which guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, can be used to construct the set of natural numbers, , such that the Peano axioms of arithmetic are satisfied.\n\nQuestioned existence\n Axiomatic set theory \nIn Zermelo set theory, the existence of the empty set is assured by the axiom of empty set, and its uniqueness follows from the axiom of extensionality. However, the axiom of empty set can be shown redundant in at least two ways:\nStandard first-order logic implies, merely from the logical axioms, that something exists, and in the language of set theory, that thing must be a set.  Now the existence of the empty set follows easily from the axiom of separation.\nEven using free logic (which does not logically imply that something exists), there is already an axiom implying the existence of at least one set, namely the axiom of infinity.\n\n Philosophical issues \nWhile the empty set is a standard and widely accepted mathematical concept, it remains an ontological curiosity, whose meaning and usefulness are debated by philosophers and logicians.\n\nThe empty set is not the same thing as nothing; rather, it is a set with nothing inside it and a set is always something. This issue can be overcome by viewing a set as a bag—an empty bag undoubtedly still exists. Darling (2004) explains that the empty set is not nothing, but rather \"the set of all triangles with four sides, the set of all numbers that are bigger than nine but smaller than eight, and the set of all opening moves in chess that involve a king.\"\n\nThe popular syllogism\nNothing is better than eternal happiness; a ham sandwich is better than nothing; therefore, a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness\nis often used to demonstrate the philosophical relation between the concept of nothing and the empty set. Darling writes that the contrast can be seen by rewriting the statements \"Nothing is better than eternal happiness\" and \"[A] ham sandwich is better than nothing\" in a mathematical tone. According to Darling, the former is equivalent to \"The set of all things that are better than eternal happiness is \" and the latter to \"The set {ham sandwich} is better than the set \". It is noted that the first compares elements of sets, while the second compares the sets themselves.\n\nJonathan Lowe argues that while the empty set:\n\"...was undoubtedly an important landmark in the history of mathematics, … we should not assume that its utility in calculation is dependent upon its actually denoting some object.\"\n\nit is also the case that:\n\"All that we are ever informed about the empty set is that it (1) is a set, (2) has no members, and (3) is unique amongst sets in having no members. However, there are very many things that 'have no members', in the set-theoretical sense—namely, all non-sets. It is perfectly clear why these things have no members, for they are not sets. What is unclear is how there can be, uniquely amongst sets, a set which has no members. We cannot conjure such an entity into existence by mere stipulation.\"\n\nGeorge Boolos argued that much of what has been heretofore obtained by set theory can just as easily be obtained by plural quantification over individuals, without reifying sets as singular entities having other entities as members.*George Boolos, 1984, \"To be is to be the value of a variable,\" The Journal of Philosophy 91: 430–49.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_%28mathematics%29",
      "text": " In mathematics, equality is a relationship between two quantities or, more generally two mathematical expressions, asserting that the quantities have the same value, or that the expressions represent the same mathematical object. The equality between  and  is written , and pronounced  equals . The symbol \"\" is called an \"equals sign\". For example:\n  means that  and  denote the same object..\n  means that, if  is any number, the two expressions have the same value. This may also be interpreted by saying that the two sides of the equals sign represent the same function.\n  if and only if  This assertion, which uses set-builder notation, means that, if the elements satisfying the property  are the same as the elements satisfying  then the two uses of the set-builder notation define the same set. This property often expressed as \"two sets that have the same elements are equal.\" It is one of the usual axioms of set theory, called Axiom of extensionality.. . .\n\nEtymology\nThe etymology of the word is from the Latin aequālis (“equal”, “like”, “comparable”, “similar”) from aequus (“equal”, “level”, “fair”, “just”).\n\n Basic properties\n Substitution property: For any quantities a and b and any expression F(x), if a = b, then F(a) = F(b) (if both sides make sense, i.e. are well-formed).\n\nSome specific examples of this are:\n For any real numbers a, b, and c, if a = b, then a + c = b + c (here F(x) is x + c);\n For any real numbers a, b, and c, if a = b, then a − c = b − c (here F(x) is x − c);\n For any real numbers a, b, and c, if a = b, then ac = bc (here F(x) is xc);\n For any real numbers a, b, and c, if a = b and c is not zero, then a/c = b/c (here F(x) is x/c).\n\n Reflexive property: For any quantity a, a = a.\n\n Symmetric property: For any quantities a and b, if a = b, then b = a.\n\n Transitive property: For any quantities a, b, and c, if a = b and b = c, then a = c.\n\nThese three properties make equality an equivalence relation. They were originally included among the Peano axioms for natural numbers. Although the symmetric and transitive properties are often seen as fundamental, they can be deduced from substitution and reflexive properties.\n\n Equality as predicate \nWhen A and B are not fully specified or depend on some variables, equality is a proposition, which may be true for some values and false for some other values. Equality is a binary relation or, in other words, a two-argument predicate, which may produce a truth value (false or true) from its arguments. In computer programming, its computation from two expressions is known as comparison.\n\n Identities\n\nWhen A and B may be viewed as functions of some variables, then A = B means that A and B define the same function. Such an equality of functions is sometimes called an identity. An example is (x + 1)2 = x2 + 2x + 1. Sometimes, but not always, an identity is written with a triple bar: (x + 1)2 ≡ x2 + 2x + 1.\n\nEquations\nAn equation is a problem of finding values of some variables, called unknowns, for which the specified equality is true. Equation may also refer to an equality relation that is satisfied only for the values of the variables that one is interested in. For example, x2 + y2 = 1 is the equation of the unit circle.\n\nThere is no standard notation that distinguishes an equation from an identity or other use of the equality relation: a reader has to guess an appropriate interpretation from the semantics of expressions and the context. An identity is asserted to be true for all values of variables in a given domain. An \"equation\" may sometimes mean an identity, but more often it specifies a subset of the variable space to be the subset where the equation is true.\n\nCongruences\n\nIn some cases, one may consider as equal two mathematical objects that are only equivalent for the properties that are considered. Particularly in the case of geometry, this is where two geometric shapes are said to be equal when one may be moved to coincide with the other. The word congruence is also used for this kind of equality.\n\n Approximate equality \nThere are some logic systems that do not have any notion of equality. This reflects the undecidability of the equality of two real numbers defined by formulas involving the integers, the basic arithmetic operations, the logarithm and the exponential function. In other words, there cannot exist any algorithm for deciding such an equality.\n\nThe binary relation \"is approximately equal\" between real numbers or other things, even if more precisely defined, is not transitive (it may seem so at first sight, but many small differences can add up to something big). However, equality almost everywhere is transitive.\n\n Relation with equivalence and isomorphism \n\nViewed as a relation, equality is the archetype of the more general concept of an equivalence relation on a set: those binary relations that are reflexive, symmetric and transitive. The identity relation is an equivalence relation. Conversely, let R be an equivalence relation, and let us denote by xR the equivalence class of x, consisting of all elements z such that x R z. Then the relation x R y is equivalent with the equality xR = yR. It follows that equality is the finest equivalence relation on any set S in the sense that it is the relation that has the smallest equivalence classes (every class is reduced to a single element).\n\nIn some contexts, equality is sharply distinguished from equivalence or isomorphism. For example, one may distinguish fractions from rational numbers, the latter being equivalence classes of fractions: the fractions  and  are distinct as fractions (as different strings of symbols) but they \"represent\" the same rational number (the same point on a number line). This distinction gives rise to the notion of a quotient set.\n\nSimilarly, the sets\n and \n\nare not equal sets — the first consists of letters, while the second consists of numbers — but they are both sets of three elements and thus isomorphic, meaning that there is a bijection between them. For example\n\nHowever, there are other choices of isomorphism, such as\n\nand these sets cannot be identified without making such a choice — any statement that identifies them \"depends on choice of identification\". This distinction, between equality and isomorphism, is of fundamental importance in category theory and is one motivation for the development of category theory.\n\n Logical definitions \n\nLeibniz characterized the notion of equality as follows:\n Given any x and y, x = y if and only if, given any predicate P, P(x) if and only if P(y).\n\nIn this law, \"P(x) if and only if P(y)\" can be weakened to \"P(x) if P(y)\"; the modified law is equivalent to the original, since a statement that applies to \"any x and y\" applies just as well to \"any y and x\".\n\nInstead of considering Leibniz's law as a true statement that can be proven from the usual laws of logic (including axioms about equality such as symmetry, reflexivity and substitution), it can also be taken as the definition of equality. The property of being an equivalence relation, as well as the properties given below, can then be proved: they become theorems.\n\n Equality in set theory \n\nEquality of sets is axiomatized in set theory in two different ways, depending on whether the axioms are based on a first-order language with or without equality.\n\n Set equality based on first-order logic with equality \nIn first-order logic with equality, the axiom of extensionality states that two sets which contain the same elements are the same set.. . .\n\n Logic axiom: x = y ⇒ ∀z, (z ∈ x ⇔ z ∈ y)\n Logic axiom: x = y ⇒ ∀z, (x ∈ z ⇔ y ∈ z)\n Set theory axiom: (∀z, (z ∈ x ⇔ z ∈ y)) ⇒ x = y\n\nIncorporating half of the work into the first-order logic may be regarded as a mere matter of convenience, as noted by Lévy.\n \"The reason why we take up first-order predicate calculus with equality is a matter of convenience; by this we save the labor of defining equality and proving all its properties; this burden is now assumed by the logic.\".\n\n Set equality based on first-order logic without equality \nIn first-order logic without equality, two sets are defined to be equal if they contain the same elements. Then the axiom of extensionality states that two equal sets are contained in the same sets.. \n\n Set theory definition: \"x = y\" means ∀z, (z ∈ x ⇔ z ∈ y)\n Set theory axiom: x = y ⇒ ∀z, (x ∈ z ⇔ y ∈ z)\n\nSee also\nEquals sign\nInequality\nLogical equality\nExtensionality\nHomotopy type theory\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:Mathematical logic\nCategory:Binary relations\nCategory:Elementary arithmetic\nCategory:Equivalence (mathematics)"

      "text": "In mathematics, a finite set is a set that has a finite number of elements.  Informally, a finite set is a set which one could in principle count and finish counting. For example,\n\nis a finite set with five elements. The number of elements of a finite set is a natural number (a non-negative integer) and is called the cardinality of the set. A set that is not finite is called infinite. For example, the set of all positive integers is infinite:\n\nFinite sets are particularly important in combinatorics, the mathematical study of counting. Many arguments involving finite sets rely on the pigeonhole principle, which states that there cannot exist an injective function from a larger finite set to a smaller finite set.\n\n Definition and terminology \n\nFormally, a set  is called finite if there exists a bijection\n\nfor some natural number .  The number  is the set's cardinality, denoted as ||.  The empty set {} or Ø is considered finite, with cardinality zero.\n\nIf a set is finite, its elements may be written — in many ways — in a sequence:\n\nIn combinatorics, a finite set with  elements is sometimes called an -set and a subset with  elements is called a -subset.  For example, the set {5,6,7} is a 3-set – a finite set with three elements – and {6,7} is a 2-subset of it.\n\n(Those familiar with the definition of the natural numbers themselves as conventional in set theory, the so-called von Neumann construction, may prefer to use the existence of the bijection , which is equivalent.)\n\n Basic properties \n\nAny proper subset of a finite set S is finite and has fewer elements than S itself.  As a consequence, there cannot exist a bijection between a finite set S and a proper subset of S.  Any set with this property is called Dedekind-finite.  Using the standard ZFC axioms for set theory, every Dedekind-finite set is also finite, but this implication cannot be proved in ZF (Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms without the axiom of choice) alone.  \nThe axiom of countable choice, a weak version of the axiom of choice, is sufficient to prove this equivalence.\n\nAny injective function between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also a surjective function (a surjection). Similarly, any surjection between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also an injection.\n\nThe union of two finite sets is finite, with\n\nIn fact:\n\nMore generally, the union of any finite number of finite sets is finite.  The Cartesian product of finite sets is also finite, with:\n\nSimilarly, the Cartesian product of finitely many finite sets is finite. A finite set with n elements has 2 distinct subsets.  That is, the\npower set of a finite set is finite, with cardinality 2.\n\nAny subset of a finite set is finite. The set of values of a function when applied to elements of a finite set is finite.\n\nAll finite sets are countable, but not all countable sets are finite. (Some authors, however, use \"countable\" to mean \"countably infinite\", so do not consider finite sets to be countable.)\n\nThe free semilattice over a finite set is the set of its non-empty subsets, with the join operation being given by set union.\n\n Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness \n\nIn Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice (ZF), the following conditions are all equivalent:\n\n S is a finite set. That is, S can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of those natural numbers less than some specific natural number.\n (Kazimierz Kuratowski) S has all properties which can be proved by mathematical induction beginning with the empty set and adding one new element at a time. (See below for the set-theoretical formulation of Kuratowski finiteness.)\n (Paul Stäckel) S can be given a total ordering which is well-ordered both forwards and backwards. That is, every non-empty subset of S has both a least and a greatest element in the subset.\n Every one-to-one function from P(P(S)) into itself is onto. That is, the powerset of the powerset of S is Dedekind-finite (see below).The equivalence of the standard numerical definition of finite sets to the Dedekind-finiteness of the power set of the power set was shown in 1912 by . This Whitehead/Russell theorem is described in more modern language by .\n Every surjective function from P(P(S)) onto itself is one-to-one.\n (Alfred Tarski) Every non-empty family of subsets of S has a minimal element with respect to inclusion., demonstrated that his definition (which is also known as I-finite) is equivalent to Kuratowski's set-theoretical definition, which he then noted is equivalent to the standard numerical definition via the proof by . (Equivalently, every non-empty family of subsets of S has a maximal element with respect to inclusion.)\n S can be well-ordered and any two well-orderings on it are order isomorphic. In other words, the well-orderings on S have exactly one order type.\n\nIf the axiom of choice is also assumed (the axiom of countable choice is sufficient), then the following conditions are all equivalent:\n\n S is a finite set.\n (Richard Dedekind) Every one-to-one function from S into itself is onto.\n Every surjective function from S onto itself is one-to-one.\n S is empty or every partial ordering of S contains a maximal element.\n\n Foundational issues \n\nGeorg Cantor initiated his theory of sets in order to provide a mathematical treatment of infinite sets. Thus the distinction between the finite and the infinite lies at the core of set theory. Certain foundationalists, the strict finitists, reject the existence of infinite sets and thus recommend a mathematics based solely on finite sets. Mainstream mathematicians consider strict finitism too confining, but acknowledge its relative consistency: the universe of hereditarily finite sets constitutes a model of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation.\n\nEven for those mathematicians who embrace infinite sets, in certain important contexts, the formal distinction between the finite and the infinite can remain a delicate matter.   The difficulty stems from Gödel's incompleteness theorems. One can interpret the theory of hereditarily finite sets within Peano arithmetic (and certainly also vice versa), so the incompleteness of the theory of Peano arithmetic implies that of the theory of hereditarily finite sets. In particular, there exists a plethora of so-called non-standard models of both theories. A seeming paradox is that there are non-standard models of the theory of hereditarily finite sets which contain infinite sets, but these infinite sets look finite from within the model. (This can happen when the model lacks the sets or functions necessary to witness the infinitude of these sets.) On account of the incompleteness theorems, no first-order predicate, nor even any recursive scheme of first-order predicates, can characterize the standard part of all such models.  So, at least from the point of view of first-order logic, one can only hope to describe finiteness approximately.\n\nMore generally, informal notions like set, and particularly finite set, may receive interpretations across a range of formal systems varying in their axiomatics and logical apparatus. The best known axiomatic set theories include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF), Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG), Non-well-founded set theory, Bertrand Russell's Type theory and all the theories of their various models. One may also choose among classical first-order logic, various higher-order logics and intuitionistic logic.\n\nA formalist might see the meaning of set varying from system to system. Some kinds of Platonists might view particular formal systems as approximating an underlying reality.\n\n Set-theoretic definitions of finiteness \n\nIn contexts where the notion of natural number sits logically prior to any notion of set, one can define a set S as finite if S admits a bijection to some set of natural numbers of the form . Mathematicians more typically choose to ground notions of number in set theory, for example they might model natural numbers by the order types of finite well-ordered sets. Such an approach requires a structural definition of finiteness that does not depend on natural numbers.\n\nVarious properties that single out the finite sets among all sets in the theory ZFC turn out logically inequivalent in weaker systems such as ZF or intuitionistic set theories. Two definitions feature prominently in the literature, one due to Richard Dedekind, the other to Kazimierz Kuratowski. (Kuratowski's is the definition used above.)\n\nA set S is called Dedekind infinite if there exists an injective, non-surjective function . Such a function exhibits a bijection between S and a proper subset of S, namely the image of f.  Given a Dedekind infinite set S, a function f, and an element x that is not in the image of f, we can form an infinite sequence of distinct elements of S, namely . Conversely, given a sequence in S consisting of distinct elements , we can define a function f such that on elements in the sequence  and f behaves like the identity function otherwise.  Thus Dedekind infinite sets contain subsets that correspond bijectively with the natural numbers. Dedekind finite naturally means that every injective self-map is also surjective.\n\n Kuratowski finiteness is defined as follows. Given any set S, the binary operation of union endows the powerset P(S) with the structure of a semilattice.  Writing K(S) for the sub-semilattice generated by the empty set and the singletons, call set S Kuratowski finite if S itself belongs to K(S).The original paper by  defined a set S to be finite when\n P(S)∖{∅} = ⋂{X ∈ P(P(S)∖{∅}); (∀x∈S, {x}∈X) and (∀A,B∈X, A∪B∈X)}.\nIn other words, S is finite when the set of all non-empty subsets of S is equal to the intersection of all classes X which satisfy:\n all elements of X are non-empty subsets of S,\n the set {x} is an element of X for all x in S,\n X is closed under pairwise unions.\nKuratowski showed that this is equivalent to the numerical definition of a finite set. Intuitively, K(S) consists of the finite subsets of S. Crucially, one does not need induction, recursion or a definition of natural numbers to define generated by since one may obtain K(S) simply by taking the intersection of all sub-semilattices containing the empty set and the singletons.\n\nReaders unfamiliar with semilattices and other notions of abstract algebra may prefer an entirely elementary formulation. Kuratowski finite means S lies in the set K(S), constructed as follows. Write M for the set of all subsets X of P(S) such that:\n X contains the empty set;\n For every set T in P(S), if X contains T then X also contains the union of T with any singleton.\nThen K(S) may be defined as the intersection of M.\n\nIn ZF, Kuratowski finite implies Dedekind finite, but not vice versa. In the parlance of a popular pedagogical formulation, when the axiom of choice fails badly, one may have an infinite family of socks with no way to choose one sock from more than finitely many of the pairs. That would make the set of such socks Dedekind finite: there can be no infinite sequence of socks, because such a sequence would allow a choice of one sock for infinitely many pairs by choosing the first sock in the sequence. However, Kuratowski finiteness would fail for the same set of socks.\n\n Other concepts of finiteness \n\nIn ZF set theory without the axiom of choice, the following concepts of finiteness for a set S are distinct. They are arranged in strictly decreasing order of strength, i.e. if a set S meets a criterion in the list then it meets all of the following criteria. In the absence of the axiom of choice the reverse implications are all unprovable, but if the axiom of choice is assumed then all of these concepts are equivalent.This list of 8 finiteness concepts is presented with this numbering scheme by both , and , although the details of the presentation of the definitions differ in some respects which do not affect the meanings of the concepts. (Note that none of these definitions need the set of finite ordinal numbers to be defined first; they are all pure \"set-theoretic\" definitions in terms of the equality and membership relations, not involving ω.)\n\n I-finite. Every non-empty set of subsets of S has a ⊆-maximal element. (This is equivalent to requiring the existence of a ⊆-minimal element. It is also equivalent to the standard numerical concept of finiteness.)\n Ia-finite. For every partition of S into two sets, at least one of the two sets is I-finite.\n II-finite. Every non-empty ⊆-monotone set of subsets of S has a ⊆-maximal element.\n III-finite. The power set P(S) is Dedekind finite.\n IV-finite. S is Dedekind finite.\n V-finite.  ∣S∣ = 0 or 2⋅∣S∣ > ∣S|.\n VI-finite. ∣S∣ = 0 or ∣S∣ = 1 or ∣S∣2 > ∣S∣.\n VII-finite. S is I-finite or not well-orderable.\n\nThe forward implications (from strong to weak) are theorems within ZF. Counter-examples to the reverse implications (from weak to strong) in ZF with urelements are found using model theory. found counter-examples to each of the reverse implications in Mostowski models. Lévy attributes most of the results to earlier papers by Mostowski and Lindenbaum.\n\nMost of these finiteness definitions and their names are attributed to  by . However, definitions I, II, III, IV and V were presented in , together with proofs (or references to proofs) for the forward implications. At that time, model theory was not sufficiently advanced to find the counter-examples.\n\n See also \n\nFinSet\nOrdinal number\nPeano arithmetic\n\n Notes \n\n References \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n External links \n\nCategory:Basic concepts in set theory\nCategory:Cardinal numbers"

      "text": "Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logicalJoachim Lambek (2007), \"Foundations of mathematics\", Encyc. Britannica and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics.Leon Horsten (2007, rev. 2012), \"Philosophy of Mathematics\" SEP In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague.\nFoundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (set, function, geometrical figure, number, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.\n\nThe foundations of mathematics as a whole does not aim to contain the foundations of every mathematical topic.\nGenerally, the foundations of a field of study refers to a more-or-less systematic analysis of its most basic or fundamental concepts, its conceptual unity and its natural ordering or hierarchy of concepts, which may help to connect it with the rest of human knowledge. The development, emergence and clarification of the foundations can come late in the history of a field, and may not be viewed by everyone as its most interesting part.\n\nMathematics always played a special role in scientific thought, serving since ancient times as a model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry, and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences (especially physics). Mathematics' many developments towards higher abstractions in the 19th century brought new challenges and paradoxes, urging for a deeper and more systematic examination of the nature and criteria of mathematical truth, as well as a unification of the diverse branches of mathematics into a coherent whole.\n\nThe systematic search for the foundations of mathematics started at the end of the 19th century and formed a new mathematical discipline called mathematical logic, with strong links to theoretical computer science.\nIt went through a series of crises with paradoxical results, until the discoveries stabilized during the 20th century as a large and coherent body of mathematical knowledge with several aspects or components (set theory, model theory, proof theory, etc.), whose detailed properties and possible variants are still an active research field.\nIts high level of technical sophistication inspired many philosophers to conjecture that it can serve as a model or pattern for the foundations of other sciences.\n\n Historical context \n\n Ancient Greek mathematics \n\nWhile the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations, special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the Ancient Greeks.\n\nEarly Greek philosophers disputed as to which is more basic, arithmetic or geometry.\nZeno of Elea (490 c. 430 BC) produced four paradoxes that seem to show the impossibility of change. The Pythagorean school of mathematics originally insisted that only natural and rational numbers exist. The discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side (around 5th century BC), was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted. The discrepancy between rationals and reals was finally resolved by Eudoxus of Cnidus (408–355 BC), a student of Plato, who reduced the comparison of irrational ratios to comparisons of multiples (rational ratios), thus anticipating the definition of real numbers by Richard Dedekind (1831–1916).\n\nIn the Posterior Analytics, Aristotle (384–322 BC) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts, axioms, postulates, definitions, and theorems. Aristotle took a majority of his examples for this from arithmetic and from geometry.\nThis method reached its high point with Euclid's Elements (300 BC), a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor: Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms (though they do not always conform strictly to Aristotelian templates).\nAristotle's syllogistic logic, together with the axiomatic method exemplified by Euclid's Elements, are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient Greece.\n\n Platonism as a traditional philosophy of mathematics \n\nStarting from the end of the 19th century, a Platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians.\n\nThe concepts or, as Platonists would have it, the objects of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience: geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects, and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects. Their existence and nature present special philosophical challenges: How do mathematical objects differ from their concrete representation? Are they located in their representation, or in our minds, or somewhere else? How can we know them?\n\nThe ancient Greek philosophers took such questions very seriously. Indeed, many of their general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. Plato (424/423 BC 348/347 BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic Ideas (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is discovered by humans. In the Meno Plato's teacher Socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval.\n\nAbove the gateway to Plato's academy appeared a famous inscription: \"Let no one who is ignorant of geometry enter here\". In this way Plato indicated his high opinion of geometry. He regarded geometry as \"the first essential in the training of philosophers\", because of its abstract character.\n\nThis philosophy of Platonist mathematical realism is shared by many mathematicians. It can be argued that Platonism somehow comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work.Karlis Podnieks, Platonism, intuition and the nature of mathematics: 1. Platonism - the Philosophy of Working Mathematicians\n\nIn this view, the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status, and the effectiveness ceases to be unreasonable. Not our axioms, but the very real world of mathematical objects forms the foundation.\n\nAristotle dissected and rejected this view in his Metaphysics. These questions provide much fuel for philosophical analysis and debate.\n\n Middle Ages and Renaissance \nFor over 2,000 years, Euclid's Elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics, as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists well into the 19th century.\n\nThe Middle Ages saw a dispute over the ontological status of the universals (platonic Ideas): Realism asserted their existence independently of perception; conceptualism asserted their existence within the mind only; nominalism denied either, only seeing universals as names of collections of individual objects (following older speculations that they are words, \"logoi\").\n\nRené Descartes published La Géométrie (1637), aimed at reducing geometry to algebra by means of coordinate systems, giving algebra a more foundational role (while the Greeks embedded arithmetic into geometry by identifying whole numbers with evenly spaced points on a line). Descartes' book became famous after 1649 and paved the way to infinitesimal calculus.\n\nIsaac Newton (1642–1727) in England and Leibniz (1646–1716) in Germany independently developed the infinitesimal calculus based on heuristic methods greatly efficient, but direly lacking rigorous justifications. Leibniz even went on to explicitly describe infinitesimals as actual infinitely small numbers (close to zero). Leibniz also worked on formal logic but most of his writings on it remained unpublished until 1903.\n\nThe Protestant philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), in his campaign against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics, wrote a pamphlet on the lack of rational justifications of infinitesimal calculus:The Analyst, A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician \"They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?\"\n\nThen mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications, but with little attention to logical foundations.\n\n 19th century \nIn the 19th century, mathematics became increasingly abstract. Concerns about logical gaps and inconsistencies in different fields led to the development of axiomatic systems.\n\n Real analysis \n\nCauchy (1789–1857) started the project of formulating and proving the theorems of infinitesimal calculus in a rigorous manner, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra exploited by earlier authors. In his 1821 work Cours d'Analyse he defines infinitely small quantities in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0, which he then used to define continuity. But he did not formalize his notion of convergence.\n\nThe modern (ε, δ)-definition of limit and continuous functions was first developed by Bolzano in 1817, but remained relatively unknown. It gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers, arguably resolving the Zeno paradoxes and Berkeley's arguments.\n\nMathematicians such as Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897) discovered pathological functions such as continuous, nowhere-differentiable functions. Previous conceptions of a function as a rule for computation, or a smooth graph, were no longer adequate. Weierstrass began to advocate the arithmetization of analysis, to axiomatize analysis using properties of the natural numbers.\n\nIn 1858, Dedekind proposed a definition of the real numbers as cuts of rational numbers. This reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers, and thus of natural numbers, was later integrated by Cantor in his set theory, and axiomatized in terms of second order arithmetic by Hilbert and Bernays.\n\n Group theory \n\nFor the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829), a Norwegian, and Évariste Galois, (1811–1832) a Frenchman, investigated the solutions of various polynomial equations, and proved that there is no general algebraic solution to equations of degree greater than four (Abel–Ruffini theorem). With these concepts, Pierre Wantzel (1837) proved that straightedge and compass alone cannot trisect an arbitrary angle nor double a cube. In 1882, Lindemann building on the work of Hermite showed that a straightedge and compass quadrature of the circle (construction of a square equal in area to a given circle) was also impossible by proving that  is a transcendental number. Mathematicians had attempted to solve all of these problems in vain since the time of the ancient Greeks.\n\nAbel and Galois's works opened the way for the developments of group theory (which would later be used to study symmetry in physics and other fields), and abstract algebra. Concepts of vector spaces emerged from the conception of barycentric coordinates by Möbius in 1827, to the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps by Peano in 1888. Geometry was no more limited to three dimensions.\nThese concepts did not generalize numbers but combined notions of functions and sets which were not yet formalized, breaking away from familiar mathematical objects.\n\n Non-Euclidean geometries \n\nAfter many failed attempts to derive the parallel postulate from other axioms, the study of the still hypothetical hyperbolic geometry by Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777) led him to introduce the hyperbolic functions and compute the area of a hyperbolic triangle (where the sum of angles is less than 180°). Then the Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792–1856) established in 1826 (and published in 1829) the coherence of this geometry (thus the independence of the parallel postulate), in parallel with the Hungarian mathematician János Bolyai (1802–1860) in 1832, and with Gauss.\nLater in the 19th century, the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann developed Elliptic geometry, another non-Euclidean geometry where no parallel can be found and the sum of angles in a triangle is more than 180°. It was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great circle on the sphere. At that time, the main method for proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a model for it.\n\n Projective geometry \nOne of the traps in a deductive system is circular reasoning, a problem that seemed to befall projective geometry until it was resolved by Karl von Staudt. As explained by Russian historians:Laptev, B.L. & B.A. Rozenfel'd (1996) Mathematics of the 19th Century: Geometry, page 40, Birkhäuser \n\nThe purely geometric approach of von Staudt was based on the complete quadrilateral to express the relation of projective harmonic conjugates. Then he created a means of expressing the familiar numeric properties with his Algebra of Throws. English language versions of this process of deducing the properties of a field can be found in either the book by Oswald Veblen and John Young, Projective Geometry (1938), or more recently in John Stillwell's Four Pillars of Geometry (2005). Stillwell writes on page 120\n\nThe algebra of throws is commonly seen as a feature of cross-ratios since students ordinarily rely upon numbers without worry about their basis. However, cross-ratio calculations use metric features of geometry, features not admitted by purists. For instance, in 1961 Coxeter wrote Introduction to Geometry without mention of cross-ratio.\n\n Boolean algebra and logic \nAttempts of formal treatment of mathematics had started with Leibniz and Lambert (1728–1777), and continued with works by algebraists such as George Peacock (1791–1858).\nSystematic mathematical treatments of logic came with the British mathematician George Boole (1847) who devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called Boolean algebra, in which the only numbers were 0 and 1 and logical combinations (conjunction, disjunction, implication and negation) are operations similar to the addition and multiplication of integers. Additionally, De Morgan published his laws in 1847. Logic thus became a branch of mathematics. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in computer science.\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce built upon the work of Boole to develop a logical system for relations and quantifiers, which he published in several papers from 1870 to 1885.\n\nThe German mathematician Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his Begriffsschrift (formula language) published in 1879, a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic. He exposed deficiencies in Aristotle's Logic, and pointed out the three expected properties of a mathematical theory:\n\n Consistency: impossibility of proving contradictory statements.\n Completeness: any statement is either provable or refutable (i.e. its negation is provable).\n Decidability: there is a decision procedure to test any statement in the theory.\n\nHe then showed in Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic) how arithmetic could be formalised in his new logic.\n\nFrege's work was popularized by Bertrand Russell near the turn of the century. But Frege's two-dimensional notation had no success. Popular notations were (x) for universal and (∃x) for existential quantifiers, coming from Giuseppe Peano and William Ernest Johnson until the ∀ symbol was introduced by Gerhard Gentzen in 1935 and became canonical in the 1960s.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1905, Ernst Schröder published Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik in three volumes. This work summarized and extended the work of Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce, and was a comprehensive reference to symbolic logic as it was understood at the end of the 19th century.\n\n Peano arithmetic \n\nThe formalization of arithmetic (the theory of natural numbers) as an axiomatic theory started with Peirce in 1881 and continued with Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano in 1888. This was still a second-order axiomatization (expressing induction in terms of arbitrary subsets, thus with an implicit use of set theory) as concerns for expressing theories in first-order logic were not yet understood. In Dedekind's work, this approach appears as completely characterizing natural numbers and providing recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the successor function and mathematical induction.\n\n Foundational crisis \nThe foundational crisis of mathematics (in German Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik) was the early 20th century's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics.\n\nSeveral schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century, as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes (such as Russell's paradox).\n\nThe name \"paradox\" should not be confused with contradiction. A contradiction in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory (such as ), showing that this theory is inconsistent and must be rejected. But a paradox may be either a surprising but true result in a given formal theory, or an informal argument leading to a contradiction, so that a candidate theory, if it is to be formalized, must disallow at least one of its steps; in this case the problem is to find a satisfying theory without contradiction. Both meanings may apply if the formalized version of the argument forms the proof of a surprising truth. For instance, Russell's paradox may be expressed as \"there is no set of all sets\" (except in some marginal axiomatic set theories).\n\nVarious schools of thought opposed each other. The leading school was that of the formalist approach, of which David Hilbert was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as Hilbert's program, which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by metamathematical finitistic means. The main opponent was the intuitionist school, led by L. E. J. Brouwer, which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols (van Dalen, 2008). The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of Mathematische Annalen, the leading mathematical journal of the time.\n\n Philosophical views \n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, three schools of philosophy of mathematics opposed each other: Formalism, Intuitionism and Logicism. The Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences  held in Königsberg in 1930 gave space to these three schools.\n Formalism \n\nIt has been claimed that formalists, such as David Hilbert (1862–1943), hold that mathematics is only a language and a series of games. Indeed, he used the words \"formula game\" in his 1927 response to L. E. J. Brouwer's criticisms:\n\nThus Hilbert is insisting that mathematics is not an arbitrary game with arbitrary rules; rather it must agree with how our thinking, and then our speaking and writing, proceeds.\n\nThe foundational philosophy of formalism, as exemplified by David Hilbert, is a response to the paradoxes of set theory, and is based on formal logic. Virtually all mathematical theorems today can be formulated as theorems of set theory. The truth of a mathematical statement, in this view, is represented by the fact that the statement can be derived from the axioms of set theory using the rules of formal logic.\n\nMerely the use of formalism alone does not explain several issues: why we should use the axioms we do and not some others, why we should employ the logical rules we do and not some others, why do \"true\" mathematical statements (e.g., the laws of arithmetic) appear to be true, and so on. Hermann Weyl would ask these very questions of Hilbert:\n\nIn some cases these questions may be sufficiently answered through the study of formal theories, in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory. As noted by Weyl, formal logical systems also run the risk of inconsistency; in Peano arithmetic, this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency, but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently finitary to be meaningful. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system S was consistent, based on principles P that only made up a small part of S. But Gödel proved that the principles P could not even prove P to be consistent, let alone S.\n\n Intuitionism \n\nIntuitionists, such as L. E. J. Brouwer (1882–1966), hold that mathematics is a creation of the human mind. Numbers, like fairy tale characters, are merely mental entities, which would not exist if there were never any human minds to think about them.\n\nThe foundational philosophy of intuitionism or constructivism, as exemplified in the extreme by Brouwer and Stephen Kleene, requires proofs to be \"constructive\" in nature the existence of an object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence. For example, as a consequence of this the form of proof known as reductio ad absurdum is suspect.\n\nSome modern theories in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense.  Some theories tend to focus on mathematical practice, and aim to describe and analyze the actual working of mathematicians as a social group. Others try to create a cognitive science of mathematics, focusing on human cognition as the origin of the reliability of mathematics when applied to the real world. These theories would propose to find foundations only in human thought, not in any objective outside construct. The matter remains controversial.\n\n Logicism \n\nLogicism is a school of thought, and research programme, in the philosophy of mathematics, based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical' in nature . Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead championed this theory initiated by Gottlob Frege and influenced by Richard Dedekind\n\n Set-theoretic Platonism \n\nMany researchers in axiomatic set theory have subscribed to what is known as set-theoretic Platonism, exemplified by Kurt Gödel.\n\nSeveral set theorists followed this approach and actively searched for axioms that may be considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the continuum hypothesis. Many large cardinal axioms were studied, but the hypothesis always remained independent from them and it is now considered unlikely that CH can be resolved by a new large cardinal axiom. Other types of axioms were considered, but none of them has reached consensus on the continuum hypothesis yet. Recent work by Hamkins proposes a more flexible alternative: a set-theoretic multiverse allowing free passage between set-theoretic universes that satisfy the continuum hypothesis and other universes that do not.\n\n Indispensability argument for realism \nThis argument by Willard Quine and Hilary Putnam says (in Putnam's shorter words),\n\nHowever Putnam was not a Platonist.\n\n Rough-and-ready realism \nFew mathematicians are typically concerned on a daily, working basis over logicism, formalism or any other philosophical position. Instead, their primary concern is that the mathematical enterprise as a whole always remains productive. Typically, they see this as ensured by remaining open-minded, practical and busy; as potentially threatened by becoming overly-ideological, fanatically reductionistic or lazy. \n\nSuch a view has also been expressed by some well-known physicists.\n\nFor example, the Physics Nobel Prize laureate Richard Feynman said\n\nAnd Steven Weinberg:<ref name=\"weinberg\">Steven Weinberg, chapter Against Philosophy wrote, in Dreams of a final theory</ref>\n\nWeinberg believed that any undecidability in mathematics, such as the continuum hypothesis, could be potentially resolved despite the incompleteness theorem, by finding suitable further axioms to add to set theory.\n\n Philosophical consequences of Gödel's completeness theorem \n\nGödel's completeness theorem establishes an equivalence in first-order logic between the formal provability of a formula and its truth in all possible models. Precisely, for any consistent first-order theory it gives an \"explicit construction\" of a model described by the theory; this model will be countable if the language of the theory is countable. However this \"explicit construction\" is not algorithmic. It is based on an iterative process of completion of the theory, where each step of the iteration consists in adding a formula to the axioms if it keeps the theory consistent; but this consistency question is only semi-decidable (an algorithm is available to find any contradiction but if there is none this consistency fact can remain unprovable).\n\nThis can be seen as a giving a sort of justification to the Platonist view that the objects of our mathematical theories are real. More precisely, it shows that the mere assumption of the existence of the set of natural numbers as a totality (an actual infinity) suffices to imply the existence of a model (a world of objects) of any consistent theory. However several difficulties remain:\n\n For any consistent theory this usually does not give just one world of objects, but an infinity of possible worlds that the theory might equally describe, with a possible diversity of truths between them.\n In the case of set theory, none of the models obtained by this construction resemble the intended model, as they are countable while set theory intends to describe uncountable infinities. Similar remarks can be made in many other cases. For example, with theories that include arithmetic, such constructions generally give models that include non-standard numbers, unless the construction method was specifically designed to avoid them.\n As it gives models to all consistent theories without distinction, it gives no reason to accept or reject any axiom as long as the theory remains consistent, but regards all consistent axiomatic theories as referring to equally existing worlds. It gives no indication on which axiomatic system should be preferred as a foundation of mathematics.\n As claims of consistency are usually unprovable, they remain a matter of belief or non-rigorous kinds of justifications. Hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions: the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory.\n\nAnother consequence of the completeness theorem is that it justifies the conception of infinitesimals as actual infinitely small nonzero quantities, based on the existence of non-standard models as equally legitimate to standard ones. This idea was formalized by Abraham Robinson into the theory of nonstandard analysis.\n\n More paradoxes \n\n1920: Thoralf Skolem corrected Leopold Löwenheim's proof of what is now called the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, leading to Skolem's paradox discussed in 1922, namely the existence of countable models of ZF, making infinite cardinalities a relative property.\n1922: Proof by Abraham Fraenkel that the axiom of choice cannot be proved from the axioms of Zermelo set theory with urelements.\n1931: Publication of Gödel's incompleteness theorems, showing that essential aspects of Hilbert's program could not be attained. It showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent recursively axiomatizable system such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetic on the (infinite) set of natural numbers a statement that formally expresses its own unprovability, which he then proved equivalent to the claim of consistency of the theory; so that (assuming the consistency as true), the system is not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be completely determined and reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in Hilbert's program. This dealt a final blow to the heart of Hilbert's program, the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means (it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the \"finitistic\" ones, but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to, it was a 'weaker' system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove).\n1936: Alfred Tarski proved his truth undefinability theorem.\n1936: Alan Turing proved that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist.\n1938: Gödel proved the consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis.\n1936–1937: Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, respectively, published independent papers showing that a general solution to the Entscheidungsproblem is impossible: the universal validity of statements in first-order logic is not decidable (it is only semi-decidable as given by the completeness theorem).\n1955: Pyotr Novikov showed that there exists a finitely presented group G such that the word problem for G is undecidable.\n1963: Paul Cohen showed that the Continuum Hypothesis is unprovable from ZFC. Cohen's proof developed the method of forcing, which is now an important tool for establishing independence results in set theory.\n1964: Inspired by the fundamental randomness in physics, Gregory Chaitin starts publishing results on algorithmic information theory (measuring incompleteness and randomness in mathematics).\n1966: Paul Cohen showed that the axiom of choice is unprovable in ZF even without urelements.\n1970: Hilbert's tenth problem is proven unsolvable: there is no recursive solution to decide whether a Diophantine equation (multivariable polynomial equation) has a solution in integers.\n1971: Suslin's problem is proven to be independent from ZFC.\n\n Partial resolution of the crisis \nStarting in 1935, the Bourbaki group of French mathematicians started publishing a series of books to formalize many areas of mathematics on the new foundation of set theory.\n\nThe intuitionistic school did not attract many adherents, and it was not until Bishop's work in 1967 that constructive mathematics was placed on a sounder footing.\n\nOne may consider that Hilbert's program has been partially completed, so that the crisis is essentially resolved, satisfying ourselves with lower requirements than Hilbert's original ambitions. His ambitions were expressed in a time when nothing was clear: it was not clear whether mathematics could have a rigorous foundation at all.\n\nThere are many possible variants of set theory, which differ in consistency strength, where stronger versions (postulating higher types of infinities) contain formal proofs of the consistency of weaker versions, but none contains a formal proof of its own consistency. Thus the only thing we don't have is a formal proof of consistency of whatever version of set theory we may prefer, such as ZF.\n\nIn practice, most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of ZFC, generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would run the risk of forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully.\n\nThe development of category theory in the middle of the 20th century showed the usefulness of set theories guaranteeing the existence of larger classes than does ZFC, such as Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory or Tarski–Grothendieck set theory, albeit that in very many cases the use of large cardinal axioms or Grothendieck universes is formally eliminable.\n\nOne goal of the reverse mathematics program is to identify whether there are areas of 'core mathematics' in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis.\n\n See also \n\n Mathematical logic\n Brouwer–Hilbert controversy\n Church–Turing thesis\n Controversy over Cantor's theory\n Epistemology\n Euclid's Elements Hilbert's problems\n Implementation of mathematics in set theory\n Liar paradox\n New Foundations\n Philosophy of mathematics\n Principia Mathematica Quasi-empiricism in mathematics\n Mathematical thought of Charles Peirce\n\n Notes \n\n References \n Avigad, Jeremy (2003) Number theory and elementary arithmetic, Philosophia Mathematica Vol. 11, pp. 257–284\n Eves, Howard (1990), Foundations and Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics Third Edition, Dover Publications, INC, Mineola NY,  (pbk.) cf §9.5 Philosophies of Mathematics pp. 266–271.

      "text": "Gerhard Karl Erich Gentzen (November 24, 1909 – August 4, 1945) was a German mathematician and logician. He made major contributions to the foundations of mathematics, proof theory, especially on natural deduction and sequent calculus. He died in 1945 after the Second World War from food deprivation after being arrested in Prague.\n\nLife and career\nGentzen was a student of Paul Bernays at the University of Göttingen. Bernays was fired as \"non-Aryan\" in April 1933 and therefore Hermann Weyl formally acted as his supervisor. Gentzen joined the Sturmabteilung in November 1933 although he was by no means compelled to do so.Menzler-Trott, p. 52. Nevertheless he kept in contact with Bernays until the beginning of the Second World War. In 1935, he corresponded with Abraham Fraenkel in Jerusalem and was implicated by the Nazi teachers' union as one who \"keeps contacts to the Chosen People.\" In 1935 and 1936, Hermann Weyl, head of the Göttingen mathematics department in 1933 until his resignation under Nazi pressure, made strong efforts to bring him to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.\n\nBetween November 1935 and 1939 he was an assistant of David Hilbert in Göttingen. Gentzen joined the Nazi Party in 1937. In April 1939 Gentzen swore the oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler as part of his academic appointment.Menzler-Trott, p. 119. From 1943 he was a teacher at the University of Prague.Gerhard Gentzen at math.muni.cz Under a contract from the SS Gentzen evidently worked for the V-2 project.Menzler-Trott, p. 238.\n\nGentzen was arrested during the citizens uprising against the occupying German forces on May 5, 1945. He, along with the rest of the staff of the German University in Prague was subsequently handed over to Russian forces. Because of his past association with the SA, NSDAP and NSD Dozentenbund, Gentzen was detained in a prison camp, where he died of malnutrition on August 4, 1945.Menzler-Trott, p. 273 ff.http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Gentzen.html\n\nWork\n\nGentzen's main work was on the foundations of mathematics, in proof theory, specifically natural deduction and the sequent calculus. His cut-elimination theorem is the cornerstone of proof-theoretic semantics, and some philosophical remarks in his \"Investigations into Logical Deduction\", together with Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work, constitute the starting point for inferential role semantics.\n\nOne of Gentzen's papers had a second publication in the ideological Deutsche Mathematik that was founded by Ludwig Bieberbach who promoted \"Aryan\" mathematics.Dipl.Math. Walter Tydecks, Neuere Geschichte der Mathematik in Deutschland (in German)\n\nGentzen proved the consistency of the Peano axioms in a paper published in 1936. In his Habilitationsschrift, finished in 1939, he determined the proof-theoretical strength of Peano arithmetic. This was done by a direct proof of the unprovability of the principle of transfinite induction, used in his 1936 proof of consistency, within Peano arithmetic. The principle can, however, be expressed in arithmetic, so that a direct proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorem followed. Gödel used a coding procedure to construct an unprovable formula of arithmetic. Gentzen's proof was published in 1943 and marked the beginning of ordinal proof theory.\n\nPublications\n \n \n \n \n \n  (Lecture hold in Münster at the institute of Heinrich Scholz on 27 June 1936)\n \n \n \n \n\nPosthumous\n \n  – Published by Paul Bernays.\n  – Published by Paul Bernays.\n\nSee also\n\nBertrand Russell\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n - (English translation).\n\n - an English translation.\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nCategory:1909 births\nCategory:1945 deaths\nCategory:People from Greifswald\nCategory:University of Göttingen alumni\nCategory:Charles University in Prague faculty\nCategory:20th-century German mathematicians\nCategory:German logicians\nCategory:People from the Province of Pomerania\nCategory:German philosophers"

He is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics. Though largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers.\n\nHis contributions include the development of modern logic in the Begriffsschrift and work in the foundations of mathematics.  His book the Foundations of Arithmetic is the seminal text of the logicist project, and is cited by Michael Dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn.

His father Carl (Karl) Alexander Frege (1809–1866) was the co-founder and headmaster of a girls' high school until his death. After Carl's death, the school was led by Frege's mother Auguste Wilhelmine Sophie Frege (née Bialloblotzky, 12 January 1815 – 14 October 1898); her mother was Auguste Amalia Maria Ballhorn, a descendant of Philipp MelanchthonLothar Kreiser, Gottlob Frege: Leben - Werk - Zeit, Felix Meiner Verlag, 2013, p. 11. and her father was Johann Heinrich Siegfried Bialloblotzky, a descendant of a Polish noble family who left Poland in the 17th century.Arndt Richter, \"Ahnenliste des Mathematikers Gottlob Frege, 1848-1925\"\n\nIn childhood, Frege encountered philosophies that would guide his future scientific career. For example, his father wrote a textbook on the German language for children aged 9–13, entitled Hülfsbuch zum Unterrichte in der deutschen Sprache für Kinder von 9 bis 13 Jahren (2nd ed., Wismar 1850; 3rd ed., Wismar and Ludwigslust: Hinstorff, 1862), the first section of which dealt with the structure and logic of language.\n\nFrege studied at a grammar school in Wismar and graduated in 1869. His teacher Gustav Adolf Leo Sachse (5 November 1843 – 1 September 1909), who was a poet, played the most important role in determining Frege's future scientific career, encouraging him to continue his studies at the University of Jena.\n\n Studies at University (1869–74) \nFrege matriculated at the University of Jena in the spring of 1869 as a citizen of the North German Confederation. In the four semesters of his studies he attended approximately twenty courses of lectures, most of them on mathematics and physics. His most important teacher was Ernst Karl Abbe (1840–1905; physicist, mathematician, and inventor). Abbe gave lectures on theory of gravity, galvanism and electrodynamics, complex analysis theory of functions of a complex variable, applications of physics, selected divisions of mechanics, and mechanics of solids. Abbe was more than a teacher to Frege: he was a trusted friend, and, as director of the optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, he was in a position to advance Frege's career. After Frege's graduation, they came into closer correspondence.\n\nHis other notable university teachers were Christian Philipp Karl Snell (1806–86; subjects: use of infinitesimal analysis in geometry, analytical geometry of planes, analytical mechanics, optics, physical foundations of mechanics); Hermann Karl Julius Traugott Schaeffer (1824–1900; analytical geometry, applied physics, algebraic analysis, on the telegraph and other electronic machines); and the philosopher Kuno Fischer (1824–1907; Kantian and critical philosophy).\n\nStarting in 1871, Frege continued his studies in Göttingen, the leading university in mathematics in German-speaking territories, where he attended the lectures of Rudolf Friedrich Alfred Clebsch (1833–72; analytical geometry), Ernst Christian Julius Schering (1824–97; function theory), Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804–91; physical studies, applied physics), Eduard Riecke (1845–1915; theory of electricity), and Hermann Lotze (1817–81; philosophy of religion). Many of the philosophical doctrines of the mature Frege have parallels in Lotze; it has been the subject of scholarly debate whether or not there was a direct influence on Frege's views arising from his attending Lotze's lectures.\n\nIn 1873, Frege attained his doctorate under Ernst Christian Julius Schering, with a dissertation under the title of \"Ueber eine geometrische Darstellung der imaginären Gebilde in der Ebene\" (\"On a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in a Plane\"), in which he aimed to solve such fundamental problems in geometry as the mathematical interpretation of projective geometry's infinitely distant (imaginary) points.\n\nFrege married Margarete Katharina Sophia Anna Lieseberg (15 February 1856 – 25 June 1904) on 14 March 1887.\n\n Work as a logician \n\nThough his education and early mathematical work focused primarily on geometry, Frege's work soon turned to logic. His  marked a turning point in the history of logic. The Begriffsschrift broke new ground, including a rigorous treatment of the ideas of functions and variables. Frege's goal was to show that mathematics grows out of logic, and in so doing, he devised techniques that took him far beyond the Aristotelian syllogistic and Stoic propositional logic that had come down to him in the logical tradition.\n\nright|thumb|250px|Title page to Begriffsschrift (1879) In effect, Frege invented axiomatic predicate logic, in large part thanks to his invention of quantified variables, which eventually became ubiquitous in mathematics and logic, and which solved the problem of multiple generality. Previous logic had dealt with the logical constants and, or, if... then..., not, and some and all, but iterations of these operations, especially \"some\" and \"all\", were little understood: even the distinction between a sentence like \"every boy loves some girl\" and \"some girl is loved by every boy\" could be represented only very artificially, whereas Frege's formalism had no difficulty expressing the different readings of \"every boy loves some girl who loves some boy who loves some girl\" and similar sentences, in complete parallel with his treatment of, say, \"every boy is foolish\".\n\nA frequently noted example is that Aristotle's logic is unable to represent mathematical statements like Euclid's theorem, a fundamental statement of number theory that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. Frege's \"conceptual notation\", however, can represent such inferences.Horsten, Leon and Pettigrew, Richard, \"Introduction\" in The Continuum Companion to Philosophical Logic (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011), p. 7.  The analysis of logical concepts and the machinery of formalization that is essential to Principia Mathematica (3 vols., 1910–13) (by Bertrand Russell, 1872–1970, and Alfred North Whitehead, 1861–1947), to Russell's theory of descriptions, to Kurt Gödel's (1906–78) incompleteness theorems, and to Alfred Tarski's (1901–83) theory of truth, is ultimately due to Frege.\n\nOne of Frege's stated purposes was to isolate genuinely logical principles of inference, so that in the proper representation of mathematical proof, one would at no point appeal to \"intuition\". If there was an intuitive element, it was to be isolated and represented separately as an axiom: from there on, the proof was to be purely logical and without gaps. Having exhibited this possibility, Frege's larger purpose was to defend the view that arithmetic is a branch of logic, a view known as logicism: unlike geometry, arithmetic was to be shown to have no basis in \"intuition\", and no need for non-logical axioms. Already in the 1879 Begriffsschrift important preliminary theorems, for example a generalized form of law of trichotomy, were derived within what Frege understood to be pure logic.\n\nThis idea was formulated in non-symbolic terms in his The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884). Later, in his Basic Laws of Arithmetic (vol. 1, 1893; vol. 2, 1903; vol. 2 was published at his own expense), Frege attempted to derive, by use of his symbolism, all of the laws of arithmetic from axioms he asserted as logical. Most of these axioms were carried over from his Begriffsschrift, though not without some significant changes. The one truly new principle was one he called the : the \"value-range\" of the function f(x) is the same as the \"value-range\" of the function g(x) if and only if ∀x[f(x) = g(x)].\n\nThe crucial case of the law may be formulated in modern notation as follows. Let {x|Fx} denote the extension of the predicate Fx, i.e., the set of all Fs, and similarly for Gx. Then Basic Law V says that the predicates Fx and Gx have the same extension iff ∀x[Fx ↔ Gx]. The set of Fs is the same as the set of Gs just in case every F is a G and every G is an F. (The case is special because what is here being called the extension of a predicate, or a set, is only one type of \"value-range\" of a function.)\n\nIn a famous episode, Bertrand Russell wrote to Frege, just as Vol. 2 of the Grundgesetze was about to go to press in 1903, showing that Russell's paradox could be derived from Frege's Basic Law V. It is easy to define the relation of membership of a set or extension in Frege's system; Russell then drew attention to \"the set of things x that are such that x is not a member of x\". The system of the Grundgesetze entails that the set thus characterised both is and is not a member of itself, and is thus inconsistent. Frege wrote a hasty, last-minute Appendix to Vol. 2, deriving the contradiction and proposing to eliminate it by modifying Basic Law V. Frege opened the Appendix with the exceptionally honest comment: \"Hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished. This was the position I was placed in by a letter of Mr. Bertrand Russell, just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion.\" (This letter and Frege's reply are translated in Jean van Heijenoort 1967.)\n\nFrege's proposed remedy was subsequently shown to imply that there is but one object in the universe of discourse, and hence is worthless (indeed, this would make for a contradiction in Frege's system if he had axiomatized the idea, fundamental to his discussion, that the True and the False are distinct objects; see, for example, Dummett 1973), but recent work has shown that much of the program of the Grundgesetze might be salvaged in other ways:\n Basic Law V can be weakened in other ways. The best-known way is due to philosopher and mathematical logician George Boolos (1940–1996), who was an expert on the work of Frege. A \"concept\" F is \"small\" if the objects falling under F cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the universe of discourse, that is, unless: ∃R[R is 1-to-1 & ∀x∃y(xRy & Fy)]. Now weaken V to V*: a \"concept\" F and a \"concept\" G have the same \"extension\" if and only if neither F nor G is small or ∀x(Fx ↔ Gx). V* is consistent if second-order arithmetic is, and suffices to prove the axioms of second-order arithmetic.\n Basic Law V can simply be replaced with Hume's principle, which says that the number of Fs is the same as the number of Gs if and only if the Fs can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the Gs. This principle, too, is consistent if second-order arithmetic is, and suffices to prove the axioms of second-order arithmetic. This result is termed Frege's theorem because it was noticed that in developing arithmetic, Frege's use of Basic Law V is restricted to a proof of Hume's principle; it is from this, in turn, that arithmetical principles are derived. On Hume's principle and Frege's theorem, see \"Frege's Logic, Theorem, and Foundations for Arithmetic\".Frege's Logic, Theorem, and Foundations for Arithmetic, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy at plato.stanford.edu\n Frege's logic, now known as second-order logic, can be weakened to so-called predicative second-order logic. Predicative second-order logic plus Basic Law V is provably consistent by finitistic or constructive methods, but it can interpret only very weak fragments of arithmetic.\n\nFrege's work in logic had little international attention until 1903 when Russell wrote an appendix to The Principles of Mathematics stating his differences with Frege. The diagrammatic notation\nthat Frege used had no antecedents (and has had no imitators since). Moreover, until Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica (3 vols.) appeared in 1910–13, the dominant approach to mathematical logic was still that of George Boole (1815–64) and his intellectual descendants, especially Ernst Schröder (1841–1902). Frege's logical ideas nevertheless spread through the writings of his student Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) and other admirers, particularly Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951).\n\n Philosopher \nFrege is one of the founders of analytic philosophy, whose work on logic and language gave rise to the linguistic turn in philosophy. His contributions to the philosophy of language include:\n Function–argument analysis of the proposition;\n Distinction between concept and object (Begriff und Gegenstand);\n Principle of compositionality;\n Context principle;\n Distinction between the sense and reference (Sinn und Bedeutung) of names and other expressions, sometimes said to involve a mediated reference theory.\n\nAs a philosopher of mathematics, Frege attacked the psychologistic appeal to mental explanations of the content of judgment of the meaning of sentences. His original purpose was very far from answering general questions about meaning; instead, he devised his logic to explore the foundations of arithmetic, undertaking to answer questions such as \"What is a number?\" or \"What objects do number-words (\"one\", \"two\", etc.) refer to?\" But in pursuing these matters, he eventually found himself analysing and explaining what meaning is, and thus came to several conclusions that proved highly consequential for the subsequent course of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of language.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that Frege was employed as a mathematician, not a philosopher, and he published his philosophical papers in scholarly journals that often were hard to access outside of the German-speaking world. He never published a philosophical monograph other than The Foundations of Arithmetic, much of which was mathematical in content, and the first collections of his writings appeared only after World War II. A volume of English translations of Frege's philosophical essays first appeared in 1952, edited by students of Wittgenstein, Peter Geach (1916-2013) and Max Black (1909–88), with the bibliographic assistance of Wittgenstein (see Geach, ed. 1975, Introduction). Despite the generous praise of Russell and Wittgenstein, Frege was little known as a philosopher during his lifetime. His ideas spread chiefly through those he influenced, such as Russell, Wittgenstein, and Carnap, and through work on logic and semantics by Polish logicians.\n\n Sense and reference \n\nFrege's 1892 paper, \"On Sense and Reference\" (\"Über Sinn und Bedeutung\"), introduced his influential distinction between sense (\"Sinn\") and reference (\"Bedeutung\", which has also been translated as \"meaning\", or \"denotation\"). While conventional accounts of meaning took expressions to have just one feature (reference), Frege introduced the view that expressions have two different aspects of significance: their sense and their reference.\n\nReference, (or, \"Bedeutung\") applied to proper names, where a given expression (say the expression \"Tom\") simply refers to the entity bearing the name (the person named Tom). Frege also held that propositions had a referential relationship with their truth-value (in other words, a statement \"refers\" to the truth-value it takes). By contrast, the sense (or \"Sinn\") associated with a complete sentence is the thought it expresses. The sense of an expression is said to be the \"mode of presentation\" of the item referred to, and there can be multiple modes of representation for the same referent.\n\nThe distinction can be illustrated thus: In their ordinary uses, the name \"Charles Philip Arthur George Mountbatten-Windsor\", which for logical purposes is an unanalyzable whole, and the functional expression \"the Prince of Wales\", which contains the significant parts \"the prince of ξ\" and \"Wales\", have the same reference, namely, the person best known as Prince Charles. But the sense of the word \"Wales\" is a part of the sense of the latter expression, but no part of the sense of the \"full name\" of Prince Charles.\n\nThese distinctions were disputed by Bertrand Russell, especially in his paper \"On Denoting\"; the controversy has continued into the present, fueled especially by Saul Kripke's famous lectures \"Naming and Necessity\".\n\n 1924 diary \nFrege's published philosophical writings were of a very technical nature and divorced from practical issues, so much so that Frege scholar Dummett expresses his \"shock to discover, while reading Frege's diary, that his hero was an anti-Semite.\"Hersh, Reuben, What Is Mathematics, Really? (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 241.  After the German Revolution of 1918–19 his political opinions became more radical. In the last year of his life, at the age of 76, his diary contains extreme right-wing political opinions, opposing the parliamentary system, democrats, liberals, Catholics, the French and Jews, who he thought ought to be deprived of political rights and, preferably, expelled from Germany.Michael Dummett: Frege: Philosophy of Language, p. xii.  Frege confided \"that he had once thought of himself as a liberal and was an admirer of Bismarck\", but then sympathized with General Ludendorff. Some interpretations have been written about that time.Hans Sluga: Heidegger's Crisis: Philosophy and Politics in Nazi Germany, pp. 99ff. Sluga's source was an article by Eckart Menzler-Trott: \"Ich wünsch die Wahrheit und nichts als die Wahrheit: Das politische Testament des deutschen Mathematikers und Logikers Gottlob Frege\". In: Forum, vol. 36, no. 432, 20 December 1989, pp. 68–79.  The diary contains a critique of universal suffrage and socialism. Frege had friendly relations with Jews in real life: among his students was Gershom Scholem, who greatly valued his teaching, and it was he who encouraged Ludwig Wittgenstein to leave for England in order to study with Bertrand Russell.Juliet Floyd, The Frege-Wittgenstein Correspondence: Interpretive Themes The 1924 diary was published posthumously in 1994.Gottfried Gabriel, Wolfgang Kienzler (editors): \"Gottlob Freges politisches Tagebuch\".

Frege apparently never spoke in public about his political viewpoints.\n\n Personality \nFrege was described by his students as a highly introverted person, seldom entering into dialogues with others and mostly facing the blackboard while lecturing. He was, however, known to occasionally show wit and even bitter sarcasm during his classes.Frege's Lectures on Logic, ed. by Erich H.

      "text": "thumb|right|Escherichia coli, one of the many species of bacteria present in the human gut\n\nGut flora, or gut microbiota, or gastrointestinal microbiota, is the complex community of microorganisms that live in the digestive tracts of humans and non-human animals, including insects. The gut metagenome is the aggregate of all the genomes of gut microbiota. The gut is one niche that human microbiota inhabit.\n\nOverview\nIn humans, the gut microbiota has the largest numbers of bacteria and the greatest number of species compared to other areas of the body. In humans, the gut flora is established at one to two years after birth, by which time the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal mucosal barrier that it secretes have co-developed in a way that is tolerant to, and even supportive of, the gut flora and that also provides a barrier to pathogenic organisms.\n\nThe relationship between some gut flora and humans is not merely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a mutualistic relationship. Some human gut microorganisms benefit the host by fermenting dietary fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetic acid and butyric acid, which are then absorbed by the host. Intestinal bacteria also play a role in synthesizing vitamin B and vitamin K as well as metabolizing bile acids, sterols, and xenobiotics. The systemic importance of the SCFAs and other compounds they produce are like hormones and the gut flora itself appears to function like an endocrine organ, and dysregulation of the gut flora has been correlated with a host of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.\n\nThe composition of human gut microbiota changes over time, when the diet changes, and as overall health changes. A systematic review from 2016 examined the preclinical and small human trials that have been conducted with certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria and identified those that had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders.\n\n Classifications \nThe microbial composition of the gut microbiota varies across the digestive tract. In the stomach and small intestine, relatively few species of bacteria are generally present. The colon, in contrast, contains a densely-populated microbial ecosystem with up to 1012 cells per gram of intestinal content. These bacteria represent between 300 and 1000 different species. However, 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species. As a consequence of their abundance in the intestine, bacteria also make up to 60% of the dry mass of feces. Fungi, protists, archaea, and viruses are also present in the gut flora, but less is known about their activities.\n\nOver 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobes, but in the cecum, aerobic bacteria reach high densities. It is estimated that these gut flora have around a hundred times as many genes in total as there are in the human genome.\n\nthumb|Candida albicans, a dimorphic fungus that grows as a yeast in the gut\n\nMany species in the gut have not been studied outside of their hosts because most cannot be cultured. While there are a small number of core species of microbes shared by most individuals, populations of microbes can vary widely among different individuals. Within an individual, microbe populations stay fairly constant over time, even though some alterations may occur with changes in lifestyle, diet and age. The Human Microbiome Project has set out to better describe the microflora of the human gut and other body locations.\n\nThe four dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Most bacteria belong to the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Bifidobacterium. Other genera, such as Escherichia and Lactobacillus, are present to a lesser extent. Species from the genus Bacteroides alone constitute about 30% of all bacteria in the gut, suggesting that this genus is especially important in the functioning of the host.\n\nFungal genera that have been detected in the gut include Candida, Saccharomyces, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhodotorula, Trametes, Pleospora, Sclerotinia, Bullera, and Galactomyces, among others. Rhodotorula is most frequently found in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease while Candida is most frequently found in individuals with hepatitis B cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B.\n\nArchaea constitute another large class of gut flora which are important in the metabolism of the bacterial products of fermentation.\n\nIndustralization is associated with changes in the microbiota and the reduction of diversity could drive certain species to extinction; in 2018, researchers proposed a biobank repository of human microbiota.\n\n Enterotype \n\nAn enterotype is a classification of living organisms based on its bacteriological ecosystem in the human gut microbiome not dictated by age, gender, body weight, or national divisions. There are indications that long-term diet influences enterotype. Three human enterotypes have been proposed, but their value has been questioned.\n\n Composition \n\n Anatomy \n\n Stomach \nDue to the high acidity of the stomach, most microorganisms cannot survive there. The main bacterial inhabitants of the stomach include: Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, and types of yeast. Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative spiral bacterium that establishes on gastric mucosa causing chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is a carcinogen for gastric cancer.\n\n Intestines \nBacteria commonly found in the human colonBacterium Incidence (%)Bacteroides fragilis 100Bacteroides melaninogenicus 100Bacteroides oralis 100Enterococcus faecalis 100Escherichia coli 100Enterobacter sp. 40–80Klebsiella sp. 40–80Bifidobacterium bifidum 30–70Staphylococcus aureus 30–50Lactobacillus 20–60Clostridium perfringens 25–35Proteus mirabilis 5–55Clostridium tetani 1–35Clostridium septicum 5–25Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3–11Salmonella enterica 3–7Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ?commonPeptostreptococcus sp. ?commonPeptococcus sp. ?common\n\nThe small intestine contains a trace amount of microorganisms due to the proximity and influence of the stomach. Gram-positive cocci and rod-shaped bacteria are the predominant microorganisms found in the small intestine. However, in the distal portion of the small intestine alkaline conditions support gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterial flora of the small intestine aid in a wide range of intestinal functions. The bacterial flora provide regulatory signals that enable the development and utility of the gut. Overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine can lead to intestinal failure. In addition the large intestine contains the largest bacterial ecosystem in the human body. About 99% of the large intestine and feces flora are made up of obligate anaerobes such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Factors that disrupt the microorganism population of the large intestine include antibiotics, stress, and parasites.\n\nBacteria make up most of the flora in the colonUniversity of Glasgow. 2005. The normal gut flora. Available through web archive. Accessed May 22, 2008 and 60% of the dry mass of feces. This fact makes feces an ideal source of gut flora for any tests and experiments by extracting the nucleic acid from fecal specimens, and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences are generated with bacterial primers. This form of testing is also often preferable to more invasive techniques, such as biopsies. Somewhere between 300 and 1000 different species live in the gut, with most estimates at about 500. However, it is probable that 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species, with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii being the most common species in healthy adults. Fungi and protists also make up a part of the gut flora, but less is known about their activities. The virome is mostly bacteriophages.\n\nResearch suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather is a mutualistic, symbiotic relationship. Though people can survive with no gut flora, the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions, such as fermenting unused energy substrates, training the immune system via end products of metabolism like propionate and acetate, preventing growth of harmful species, regulating the development of the gut, producing vitamins for the host (such as biotin and vitamin K), and producing hormones to direct the host to store fats. Extensive modification and imbalances of the gut microbiota and its microbiome or gene collection are associated with obesity. However, in certain conditions, some species are thought to be capable of causing disease by causing infection or increasing cancer risk for the host.\n\n Age \n\nIt has been demonstrated that there are common patterns of microbiome composition evolution during life. In general, the diversity of microbiota composition of fecal samples is significantly higher in adults than in children, although interpersonal differences are higher in children than in adults. Much of the maturation of microbiota into an adult-like configuration happens during the three first years of life.\n\nAs the microbiome composition changes, so does the composition of bacterial proteins produced in the gut. In adult microbiomes, a high prevalence of enzymes involved in fermentation, methanogenesis and the metabolism of arginine, glutamate, aspartate and lysine have been found. In contrast, in infant microbiomes the dominant enzymes are involved in cysteine metabolism and fermentation pathways.\n\n Diet \n\nStudies and statistical analyses have identified the different bacterial genera in gut microbiota and their associations with nutrient intake. Gut microflora is mainly composed of three enterotypes: Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus. There is an association between the concentration of each microbial community and diet. For example, Prevotella is related to carbohydrates and simple sugars, while Bacteroides is associated with proteins, amino acids, and saturated fats. Specialist microbes that break down mucin, survive on their host's carbohydrate excretions. One enterotype will dominate depending on the diet. Altering the diet will result in a corresponding change in the numbers of species.\n\n Vegetarian and vegan diets \nWhile plant based diets have some variation, vegetarian and vegan diets patterns are the most common. Vegetarian diets exclude meat products but still allow for eggs and dairy, while vegan diets exclude all forms of animal products. The diets of vegetarian and vegan individuals create a microbiome distinct from meat eaters, however there is not a significant distinction between the two. In diets that are centered around meat and animal products, there are high abundances of Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides which are all bile tolerant and may promote inflammation in the gut. In this type of diet, the group Firmicutes, which is associated with the metabolism of dietary plant polysaccharides, is found in low concentrations. Conversely, diets rich in plant-based materials are associated with greater diversity in the gut microbiome overall, and have a greater abundance of Prevotella, responsible for the long-term processing of fibers, rather than the bile tolerant species. Diet can be used to alter the composition of the gut microbiome in relatively short timescales. However, if wanting to change the microbiome to combat a disease or illness, long-term changes in diet changes have proven to be most successful.\n\n Malnourishment \nMalnourished human children have less mature and less diverse gut microbiota than healthy children, and changes in the microbiome associated with nutrient scarcity can in turn be a pathophysiological cause of malnutrition. Malnourished children also typically have more potentially pathogenic gut flora, and more yeast in their mouths and throats. Altering diet may lead to changes in gut microbiota composition and diversity.\n\n Geography \n\nGut microbiome composition depends on the geographic origin of populations. Variations in a trade-off of Prevotella, the representation of the urease gene, and the representation of genes encoding glutamate synthase/degradation or other enzymes involved in amino acids degradation or vitamin biosynthesis show significant differences between populations from the US, Malawi or Amerindian origin.\n\nThe US population has a high representation of enzymes encoding the degradation of glutamine and enzymes involved in vitamin and lipoic acid biosynthesis; whereas Malawi and Amerindian populations have a high representation of enzymes encoding glutamate synthase and they also have an overrepresentation of α-amylase in their microbiomes. As the US population has a diet richer in fats than Amerindian or Malawian populations which have a corn-rich diet, the diet is probably the main determinant of the gut bacterial composition.\n\nFurther studies have indicated a large difference in the composition of microbiota between European and rural African children. The fecal bacteria of children from Florence were compared to that of children from the small rural village of Boulpon in Burkina Faso. The diet of a typical child living in this village is largely lacking in fats and animal proteins and rich in polysaccharides and plant proteins. The fecal bacteria of European children were dominated by Firmicutes and showed a marked reduction in biodiversity, while the fecal bacteria of the Boulpon children was dominated by Bacteroidetes. The increased biodiversity and different composition of gut flora in African populations may aid in the digestion of normally indigestible plant polysaccharides and also may result in a reduced incidence of non-infectious colonic diseases.\n\nOn a smaller scale, it has been shown that sharing numerous common environmental exposures in a family is a strong determinant of individual microbiome composition. This effect has no genetic influence and it is consistently observed in culturally different populations.\n\n Acquisition in human infants \nThe establishment of a gut flora is crucial to the health of an adult, as well the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. In humans, a gut flora similar to an adult's is formed within one to two years of birth.\n\nThe traditional view of the gastrointestinal tract of a normal fetus is that it is sterile, although this view has been challenged in the past few years. Multiple lines of evidence have begun to emerge that suggest there may be bacteria in the intrauterine environment. In humans, research has shown that microbial colonization may occur in the fetus with one study showing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species were present in placental biopsies. Several rodent studies have demonstrated the presence of bacteria in the amniotic fluid and placenta, as well as in the meconium of babies born by sterile cesarean section. In another study, researchers administered a culture of bacteria orally to a pregnant dam, and detected the bacteria in the offspring, likely resulting from transmission between the digestive tract and amniotic fluid via the blood stream. However, researchers caution that the source of these intrauterine bacteria, whether they are alive, and their role, is not yet understood.\n\nDuring birth and rapidly thereafter, bacteria from the mother and the surrounding environment colonize the infant's gut. The exact sources of bacteria is not fully understood, but may include the birth canal, other people (parents, siblings, hospital workers), breastmilk, food, and the general environment with which the infant interacts. However, as of 2013, it remains unclear whether most colonizing arises from the mother or not. Infants born by caesarean section may also be exposed to their mothers' microflora, but the initial exposure is most likely to be from the surrounding environment such as the air, other infants, and the nursing staff, which serve as vectors for transfer.\nDuring the first year of life, the composition of the gut flora is generally simple and changes a great deal with time and is not the same across individuals. The initial bacterial population are generally facultative anaerobic organisms; investigators believe that these initial colonizers decrease the oxygen concentration in the gut, which in turn allows obligately anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes to become established and thrive. Breast-fed babies become dominated by bifidobacteria, possibly due to the contents of bifidobacterial growth factors in breast milk, and by the fact that breast milk carries prebiotic components, allowing for healthy bacterial growth. In contrast, the microbiota of formula-fed infants is more diverse, with high numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, and clostridia.\n\nCaesarean section, antibiotics, and formula feeding may alter the gut microbiome composition. Children treated with antibiotics have less stable, and less diverse floral communities. Caesarean sections have been shown to be disruptive to mother-offspring transmission of bacteria, which impacts the overall health of the offspring by raising risks of disease such as celiacs, asthma, and type 1 diabetes. This further evidences the importance of a healthy gut microbiome. Various methods of microbiome restoration are being explored, typically involving exposing the infant to maternal vaginal contents, and oral probiotics.\n\n Functions \nWhen the gut flora first started to be studied, it was thought to have three key roles: directly defending against pathogens, fortifying host defense by its role in developing and maintaining the intestinal epithelium and inducing antibody production there, and metabolizing otherwise indigestible compounds in food; subsequent work discovered its role in training the developing immune system, and yet further work focused on its role in the gut-brain axis.\n\n Direct inhibition of pathogens \nThe gut flora community plays a direct role in defending against pathogens by fully colonizing the space, making use of all available nutrients, and by secreting compounds that kill or inhibit unwelcome organisms that would compete for nutrients with it. Disruption of the gut flora allows competing organisms like Clostridium difficile to become established that otherwise are kept in abeyance.\n\nDevelopment of enteric protection and immune system \nthumbnail|right|Microfold cells transfer antigens (Ag) from the lumen of the gut to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) via transcytosis and present them to different innate and adaptive immune cells.\nIn humans, a gut flora similar to an adult's is formed within one to two years of birth. As the gut flora gets established, the lining of the intestines – the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal mucosal barrier that it secretes – develop as well, in a way that is tolerant to, and even supportive of, commensalistic microorganisms to a certain extent and also provides a barrier to pathogenic ones. Specifically, goblet cells that produce the mucosa proliferate, and the mucosa layer thickens, providing an outside mucosal layer in which \"friendly\" microorganisms can anchor and feed, and an inner layer that even these organisms cannot penetrate. Additionally, the development of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which forms part of the intestinal epithelium and which detects and reacts to pathogens, appears and develops during the time that the gut flora develops and established. The GALT that develops is tolerant to gut flora species, but not to other microorganisms. GALT also normally becomes tolerant to food to which the infant is exposed, as well as digestive products of food, and gut flora's metabolites (molecules formed from metabolism) produced from food.\n\nThe human immune system creates cytokines that can drive the immune system to produce inflammation in order to protect itself, and that can tamp down the immune response to maintain homeostasis and allow healing after insult or injury. Different bacterial species that appear in gut flora have been shown to be able to drive the immune system to create cytokines selectively; for example Bacteroides fragilis and some Clostridia species appear to drive an anti-inflammatory response, while some segmented filamentous bacteria drive the production of inflammatory cytokines. Gut flora can also regulate the production of antibodies by the immune system. One function of this regulation is to cause B cells to class switch to IgA. In most cases B cells need activation from T helper cells to induce class switching; however, in another pathway, gut flora cause NF-kB signaling by intestinal epithelial cells which results in further signaling molecules being secreted. These signaling molecules interact with B cells to induce class switching to IgA. IgA is an important type of antibody that is used in mucosal environments like the gut. It has been shown that IgA can help diversify the gut community and helps in getting rid of bacteria that cause inflammatory responses. Ultimately, IgA maintains a healthy environment between the host and gut bacteria. These cytokines and antibodies can have effects outside the gut, in the lungs and other tissues.\n\nThe immune system can also be altered due to the gut bacteria's ability to produce metabolites that can affect cells in the immune system. For example short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) can be produced by some gut bacteria through fermentation. SCFAs stimulate a rapid increase in the production of innate immune cells like neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils. These cells are part of the innate immune system that try to limit the spread of infection.\n\n Metabolism \n\nWithout gut flora, the human body would be unable to utilize some of the undigested carbohydrates it consumes, because some types of gut flora have enzymes that human cells lack for breaking down certain polysaccharides. Rodents raised in a sterile environment and lacking in gut flora need to eat 30% more calories just to remain the same weight as their normal counterparts. Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include certain starches, fiber, oligosaccharides, and sugars that the body failed to digest and absorb like lactose in the case of lactose intolerance and sugar alcohols, mucus produced by the gut, and proteins.\n\nBacteria turn carbohydrates they ferment into short-chain fatty acids by a form of fermentation called saccharolytic fermentation. Products include acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid. These materials can be used by host cells, providing a major source of energy and nutrients. Gases and organic acids, such as lactic acid, are also produced by fermentation. Acetic acid is used by muscle, propionic acid facilitates liver production of ATP, and butyric acid provides energy to gut cells.\n\nGut flora also synthesize vitamins like biotin and folate, and facilitate absorption of dietary minerals, including magnesium, calcium, and iron. Methanobrevibacter smithii is unique because it is not a species of bacteria, but rather a member of domain Archeae, and is the most abundant methane-producing archaeal species in the human gastrointestinal microbiota.\n\n Host-gut microbiota-xenobiotic interaction \nApart from carbohydrates, gut microbiota can also metabolize other xenobiotics such as drugs, phytochemicals, and food toxicants. More than 30 drugs have been shown to be metabolized by gut microbiota. The microbial metabolism of drugs can sometimes inactivate the drug.\n\n Gut-brain axis \n\nThe gut-brain axis is the biochemical signaling that takes place between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. That term has been expanded to include the role of the gut flora in the interplay; the term \"microbiome-gut-brain axis\" is sometimes used to describe paradigms explicitly including the gut flora. Broadly defined, the gut-brain axis includes the central nervous system, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems including the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis), sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system including the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the gut microbiota.\n\nA systematic review from 2016 examined the preclinical and small human trials that have been conducted with certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria and found that among those tested, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera (B. longum, B. breve, B. infantis, L. helveticus, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, and L. casei), had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders.\n\n Alterations in flora balance \n\n Effects of antibiotic use \n\nAltering the numbers of gut bacteria, for example by taking broad-spectrum antibiotics, may affect the host's health and ability to digest food. Antibiotics can cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) by irritating the bowel directly, changing the levels of gut flora, or allowing pathogenic bacteria to grow. Another harmful effect of antibiotics is the increase in numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria found after their use, which, when they invade the host, cause illnesses that are difficult to treat with antibiotics.\n\nChanging the numbers and species of gut flora can reduce the body's ability to ferment carbohydrates and metabolize bile acids and may cause diarrhea. Carbohydrates that are not broken down may absorb too much water and cause runny stools, or lack of SCFAs produced by gut flora could cause diarrhea.\n\nA reduction in levels of native bacterial species also disrupts their ability to inhibit the growth of harmful species such as C. difficile and Salmonella kedougou, and these species can get out of hand, though their overgrowth may be incidental and not be the true cause of diarrhea. Emerging treatment protocols for C. difficile infections involve fecal microbiota transplantation of donor feces. (see Fecal transplant). Initial reports of treatment describe success rates of 90%, with few side effects. Efficacy is speculated to result from restoring bacterial balances of bacteroides and firmicutes classes of bacteria.\n\nGut flora composition also changes in severe illnesses, due not only to antibiotic use but also to such factors as ischemia of the gut, failure to eat, and immune compromise. Negative effects from this have led to interest in selective digestive tract decontamination (SDD), a treatment to kill only pathogenic bacteria and allow the re-establishment of healthy ones.\n\nAntibiotics alter the population of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota, may change the intra-community metabolic interactions, modify caloric intake by using carbohydrates, and globally affects host metabolic, hormonal and immune homeostasis.\n\nThere is reasonable evidence that taking probiotics containing Lactobacillus species may help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and that taking probiotics with Saccharomyces (e.g., Saccharomyces boulardii ) may help to prevent Clostridium difficile infection following systemic antibiotic treatment.\n\n Pregnancy \n\nWomen's gut microbiota change as pregnancy advances, with the changes similar to those seen in metabolic syndromes such as diabetes. The change in gut flora causes no ill effects. The newborn's gut biota resemble the mother's first-trimester samples. The diversity of the flora decreases from the first to third trimester, as the numbers of certain species go up.\n\n Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and pharmabiotics \nProbiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed. With regard to gut flora, prebiotics are typically non-digestible, fiber compounds that pass undigested through the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and stimulate the growth or activity of advantageous gut flora by acting as substrate for them.\n\nSynbiotics refers to food ingredients or dietary supplements combining probiotics and prebiotics in a form of synergism.\n\nThe term \"pharmabiotics\" is used in various ways, to mean: pharmaceutical formulations (standardized manufacturing that can obtain regulatory approval as a drug) of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics; probiotics that have been genetically engineered or otherwise optimized for best performance (shelf life, survival in the digestive tract, etc.); and the natural products of gut flora metabolism (vitamins, etc.).\n\nThere is some evidence that treatment with some probiotic strains of bacteria may be effective in irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation. Those organisms most likely to result in a decrease of symptoms have included:\n\n Enterococcus faecium\n Lactobacillus plantarum\n Lactobacillus rhamnosus\n Propionibacterium freudenreichii\n Bifidobacterium breve\n Lactobacillus reuteri\n Lactobacillus salivarius\n Bifidobacterium infantis\n Streptococcus thermophilus\n\n Research \nTests for whether non-antibiotic drugs may impact human gut-associated bacteria were performed by in vitro analysis on more than 1000 marketed drugs against 40 gut bacterial strains, demonstrating that 24% of the drugs inhibited the growth of at least one of the bacterial strains.\n\n Role in disease \n\nBacteria in the digestive tract can contribute to and be affected by disease in various ways. The presence or overabundance of some kinds of bacteria may contribute to inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, metabolites from certain members of the gut flora may influence host signalling pathways, contributing to disorders such as obesity and colon cancer. Alternatively, in the event of a breakdown of the gut epithelium, the intrusion of gut flora components into other host compartments can lead to sepsis.\n\n Ulcers \nHelicobacter pylori can cause stomach ulcers by crossing the epithelial lining of the stomach. Here the body produces an immune response. During this response, parietal cells are stimulated and release extra hydrochloric acid (HCl+) into the stomach. However, the response does not stimulate the mucus-secreting cells that protect and line the epithelium of the stomach. The extra acid sears holes into the epithelial lining of the stomach, resulting in stomach ulcers.\n\n Bowel perforation\nNormally-commensal bacteria can harm the host if they extrude from the intestinal tract. Translocation, which occurs when bacteria leave the gut through its mucosal lining, can occur in a number of different diseases. If the gut is perforated, bacteria invade the interstitium, causing a potentially fatal infection.\n\n Inflammatory bowel diseases \nThe two main types of inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gut; the causes of these disease are unknown and issues with the gut flora and its relationship with the host have been implicated in these conditions. Additionally, it appears that interactions of gut flora with the gut-brain axis have a role in IBD, with physiological stress mediated through the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis driving changes to intestinal epithelium and the gut flora in turn releasing factors and metabolites that trigger signaling in the enteric nervous system and the vagus nerve.\n\nThe diversity of gut flora appears to be significantly diminished in people with inflammatory bowel diseases compared to healthy people; additionally, in people with ulcerative colitis, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria appear to dominate; in people with Crohn's, Enterococcus faecium and several Proteobacteria appear to be over-represented.\n\nThere is reasonable evidence that correcting gut flora imbalances by taking probiotics with Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria can reduce visceral pain and gut inflammation in IBD.\n\n Irritable bowel syndrome \nIrritable bowel syndrome is a result of stress and chronic activation of the HPA axis; its symptoms include abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, and an increase in proinflammatory cytokines. Overall, studies have found that the luminal and mucosal microbiota are changed in irritable bowel syndrome individuals, and these changes can relate to the type of irritation such as diarrhea or constipation. Also, there is a decrease in the diversity of the microbiome with low levels of fecal Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, high levels of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and increased ratios of Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes.\n\n Other inflammatory or autoimmune conditions \nAllergy, asthma, and diabetes mellitus are autoimmune and inflammatory disorders of unknown cause, but have been linked to imbalances in the gut flora and its relationship with the host. As of 2016 it was not clear if changes to the gut flora cause these auto-immune and inflammatory disorders or are a product of or adaptation to them.\n\n Asthma \nWith asthma, two hypotheses have been posed to explain its rising prevalence in the developed world. The hygiene hypothesis posits that children in the developed world are not exposed to enough microbes and thus may contain lower prevalence of specific bacterial taxa that play protective roles. The second hypothesis focuses on the Western pattern diet, which lacks whole grains and fiber and has an overabundance of simple sugars. Both hypotheses converge on the role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in immunomodulation. These bacterial fermentation metabolites are involved in immune signalling that prevents the triggering of asthma and lower SCFA levels are associated with the disease. Lacking protective genera such as Lachnospira, Veillonella, Rothia and Faecalibacterium has been linked to reduced SCFA levels. Further, SCFAs are the product of bacterial fermentation of fiber, which is low in the Western pattern diet. SCFAs offer a link between gut flora and immune disorders, and as of 2016, this was an active area of research. Similar hypotheses have also been posited for the rise of food and other allergies.\n\n Diabetes mellitus type 1 \nThe connection between the gut microbiota and diabetes mellitus type 1 has also been linked to anti-inflammatory SCFAs, such as butyrate, regulating the associated low-grade inflammatory state by controlling gut permeability. Additionally, butyrate has also been shown to decrease insulin resistance, suggesting gut communities low in butyrate-producing microbes may increase chances of acquiring diabetes mellitus type 2.\n\n Obesity and metabolic syndrome \nThe gut flora has also been implicated in obesity and metabolic syndrome due to the key role it plays in the digestive process; the Western pattern diet appears to drive and maintain changes in the gut flora that in turn change how much energy is derived from food and how that energy is used. One aspect of a healthy diet that is often lacking in the Western-pattern diet is fiber and other complex carbohydrates that a healthy gut flora require flourishing; changes to gut flora in response to a Western-pattern diet appear to increase the amount of energy generated by the gut flora which may contribute to obesity and metabolic syndrome. There is also evidence that microbiota influence eating behaviours based on the preferences of the microbiota, which can lead to the host consuming more food eventually resulting in obesity. It has generally been observed that with higher gut microbiome diversity, the microbiota will spend energy and resources on competing with other microbiota and less on manipulating the host. The opposite is seen with lower gut microbiome diversity, and these microbiotas may work together to create host food cravings.\n\nAdditionally, the liver plays a dominant role in blood glucose homeostasis by maintaining a balance between the uptake and storage of glucose through the metabolic pathways of glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis. Intestinal lipids regulate glucose homeostasis involving a gut-brain-liver axis. The direct administration of lipids into the upper intestine increases the long chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A (LCFA-CoA) levels in the upper intestines and suppresses glucose production even under subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or gut vagal deafferentation. This interrupts the neural connection between the brain and the gut and blocks the upper intestinal lipids' ability to inhibit glucose production. The gut-brain-liver axis and gut microbiota composition can regulate the glucose homeostasis in the liver and provide potential therapeutic methods to treat obesity and diabetes.\n\nJust as gut flora can function in a feedback loop that can drive the development of obesity, there is evidence that restricting intake of calories (i.e., dieting) can drive changes to the composition of the gut flora.\n\n Liver disease \nAs the liver is fed directly by the portal vein, whatever crosses the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal mucosal barrier enters the liver, as do cytokines generated there. Dysbiosis in the gut flora has been linked with the development of cirrhosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\n Cancer \nSome genera of bacteria, such as Bacteroides and Clostridium, have been associated with an increase in tumor growth rate, while other genera, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, are known to prevent tumor formation. As of December 2017 there was preliminary and indirect evidence that gut microbiota might mediate response to PD-1 inhibitors; the mechanism was unknown.\n\n Neuropsychiatric \n\nInterest in the relationship between gut flora and neuropsychiatric issues was sparked by a 2004 study showing that germ-free mice showed an exaggerated HPA axis response to stress compared to non-GF laboratory mice. As of January 2016, most of the work that has been done on the role of gut flora in the gut-brain axis had been conducted in animals, or characterizing the various neuroactive compounds that gut flora can produce, and studies with humans measuring differences between people with various psychiatric and neurological differences, or changes to gut flora in response to stress, or measuring effects of various probiotics (dubbed \"psychobiotics in this context), had generally been small and could not be generalized; whether changes to gut flora are a result of disease, a cause of disease, or both in any number of possible feedback loops in the gut-brain axis, remained unclear.\n\nA systematic review from 2016 examined the preclinical and small human trials that have been conducted with certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria and found that among those tested, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera (B. longum, B. breve, B. infantis, L. helveticus, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, and L. casei), had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders.\n\n Other animals \nAside from humans and mammals, some insects also possess complex and diverse gut microbiota that play key nutritional roles. Microbial communities associated termites can constitute a majority of the weight of the individuals and perform important roles in the digestion of lignocellulose and nitrogen fixation. These communities are host-specific, and closely related insect species share comparable similarities in gut microbiota composition. In cockroaches, gut microbiota have been shown to assemble in a deterministic fashion, irrespective of the inoculum; the reason for this host-specific assembly remains unclear. Bacterial communities associated with insects like termites and cockroaches are determined by a combination of forces, primarily diet, but there is some indication that host phylogeny may also be playing a role in the selection of lineages.\n\nFor more than 51 years it has been known that the administration of low doses of antibacterial agents promotes the growth of farm animals to increase weight gain.\n\nIn a study performed on mice by Ilseung Cho, the ratio of Firmicutes and Lachnospiraceae was significantly elevated in animals treated with subtherapeutic doses of different antibiotics. By analyzing the caloric content of faeces and the concentration of small chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the GI tract, they concluded that the changes in the composition of microbiota lead to an increased capacity to extract calories from otherwise indigestible constituents, and to an increased production of SCFAs. These findings provide evidence that antibiotics perturb not only the composition of the GI microbiome but also its metabolic capabilities, specifically with respect to SCFAs.\n\n See also \n\n Colonisation resistance\n List of human flora\n List of microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women\n Skin flora\n Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli\n\n Sources and notes \n\n Further reading \n Review articles\n \n \n \n \n\n \nCategory:Bacteriology\nCategory:Digestive system\nCategory:Firmicutes\nCategory:Environmental microbiology\nCategory:Microbiomes"

      "text": "In computability theory, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running (i.e., halt) or continue to run forever.\n\nAlan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist. A key part of the proof was a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which became known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines. Turing's proof is one of the first cases of decision problems to be concluded.  The theoretical conclusion of not solvable is significant to practical computing efforts, defining a class of applications which no programming invention can possibly perform perfectly.\n\nInformally, for any program f that might determine if programs halt, a \"pathological\" program g called with an input can pass its own source and its input to f and then specifically do the opposite of what f predicts g will do.  No f can exist that handles this case.\n\nJack Copeland (2004) attributes the introduction of the term halting problem to the work of Martin Davis in the 1950s.In none of his work did Turing use the word \"halting\" or \"termination\". Turing's biographer Hodges does not have the word \"halting\" or words \"halting problem\" in his index.  The earliest known use of the words \"halting problem\" is in a proof by Davis (1958, p. 70–71):\n\"Theorem 2.2 There exists a Turing machine whose halting problem is recursively unsolvable.\n\"A related problem is the printing problem for a simple Turing machine Z with respect to a symbol Si\".\nDavis adds no attribution for his proof, so one infers that it is original with him. But Davis has pointed out that a statement of the proof exists informally in Kleene (1952, p. 382). Copeland (2004, p 40) states that:\n \"The halting problem was so named (and it appears, first stated) by Martin Davis [cf. Copeland footnote 61]... (It is often said that Turing stated and proved the halting theorem in 'On Computable Numbers', but strictly this is not true).\"\n\n Background \n\nThe halting problem is a decision problem about properties of computer programs on a fixed Turing-complete model of computation, i.e., all programs that can be written in some given programming language that is general enough to be equivalent to a Turing machine. The problem is to determine, given a program and an input to the program, whether the program will eventually halt when run with that input. In this abstract framework, there are no resource limitations on the amount of memory or time required for the program's execution; it can take arbitrarily long and use an arbitrary amount of storage space before halting. The question is simply whether the given program will ever halt on a particular input.\n\nFor example, in pseudocode, the program\n\nwhile (true) continue\n\ndoes not halt; rather, it goes on forever in an infinite loop. On the other hand, the program\n\nprint \"Hello, world!\"\n\ndoes halt.\n\nWhile deciding whether these programs halt is simple, more complex programs prove problematic.\n\nOne approach to the problem might be to run the program for some number of steps and check if it halts. But if the program does not halt, it is unknown whether the program will eventually halt or run forever.\n\nTuring proved no algorithm exists that always correctly decides whether, for a given arbitrary program and input, the program halts when run with that input. The essence of Turing's proof is that any such algorithm can be made to contradict itself and therefore cannot be correct.\n\n Programming consequences \n\nSome infinite loops can be quite useful. For instance, event loops are typically coded as infinite loops.\nHowever, most subroutines are intended to finish (halt).Han-Way Huang.\n\"The HCS12 / 9S12: An Introduction to Software and Hardware Interfacing\".\np. 197.\nquote: \"... if the program gets stuck in a certain loop, ... figure out what's wrong.\"\nIn particular, in hard real-time computing,\nprogrammers attempt to write subroutines that are not only guaranteed to finish (halt),\nbut are also guaranteed to finish before a given deadline.David E. Simon.\n\"An Embedded Software Primer\".\n1999.\np. 253.\nquote: \"For hard real-time systems, therefore, it is important to write subroutines that always execute in the same amount of time or that have a clearly identifiable worst case.\"\n\nSometimes these programmers use some general-purpose (Turing-complete) programming language,\nbut attempt to write in a restricted style—such as MISRA C or SPARK—that makes it easy to prove that the resulting subroutines finish before the given deadline.\n\nOther times these programmers apply the rule of least power—they deliberately use a computer language that is not quite fully Turing-complete, often a language that guarantees that all subroutines are guaranteed to finish, such as Coq.\n\n Common pitfalls \n\nThe difficulty in the halting problem lies in the requirement that the decision procedure must work for all programs and inputs. A particular program either halts on a given input or does not halt. Consider one algorithm that always answers \"halts\" and another that always answers \"doesn't halt\". For any specific program and input, one of these two algorithms answers correctly, even though nobody may know which one. Yet neither algorithm solves the halting problem generally.\n\nThere are programs (interpreters) that simulate the execution of whatever source code they are given. Such programs can demonstrate that a program does halt if this is the case: the interpreter itself will eventually halt its simulation, which shows that the original program halted. However, an interpreter will not halt if its input program does not halt, so this approach cannot solve the halting problem as stated; it does not successfully answer \"doesn't halt\" for programs that do not halt.\n\nThe halting problem is theoretically decidable for linear bounded automata (LBAs) or deterministic machines with finite memory. A machine with finite memory has a finite number of states, and thus any deterministic program on it must eventually either halt or repeat a previous state:\n...any finite-state machine, if left completely to itself, will fall eventually into a perfectly periodic repetitive pattern. The duration of this repeating pattern cannot exceed the number of internal states of the machine... (italics in original, Minsky 1967, p. 24)\n\nMinsky warns us, however, that machines such as computers with e.g., a million small parts, each with two states, will have at least 21,000,000 possible states:\nThis is a 1 followed by about three hundred thousand zeroes ... Even if such a machine were to operate at the frequencies of cosmic rays, the aeons of galactic evolution would be as nothing compared to the time of a journey through such a cycle (Minsky 1967 p. 25):\n\nMinsky exhorts the reader to be suspicious—although a machine may be finite, and finite automata \"have a number of theoretical limitations\":\n...the magnitudes involved should lead one to suspect that theorems and arguments based chiefly on the mere finiteness [of] the state diagram may not carry a great deal of significance. (Minsky p. 25)\n\nIt can also be decided automatically whether a nondeterministic machine with finite memory halts on none, some, or all of the possible sequences of nondeterministic decisions, by enumerating states after each possible decision.\n\n History \n\nThe halting problem is historically important because it was one of the first problems to be proved undecidable. (Turing's proof went to press in May 1936, whereas Alonzo Church's proof of the undecidability of a problem in the lambda calculus had already been published in April 1936 [Church, 1936].) Subsequently, many other undecidable problems have been described.\n\nTimeline\n\n 1900: David Hilbert poses his \"23 questions\" (now known as Hilbert's problems) at the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. \"Of these, the second was that of proving the consistency of the 'Peano axioms' on which, as he had shown, the rigour of mathematics depended\". (Hodges p. 83, Davis' commentary in Davis, 1965, p. 108)\n 1920–1921: Emil Post explores the halting problem for tag systems, regarding it as a candidate for unsolvability. (Absolutely unsolvable problems and relatively undecidable propositions – account of an anticipation, in Davis, 1965, pp. 340–433.) Its unsolvability was not established until much later, by Marvin Minsky (1967).\n 1928: Hilbert recasts his 'Second Problem' at the Bologna International Congress. (Reid pp. 188–189) Hodges claims he posed three questions: i.e. #1: Was mathematics complete? #2: Was mathematics consistent? #3: Was mathematics decidable?  (Hodges p. 91). The third question is known as the Entscheidungsproblem (Decision Problem). (Hodges p. 91, Penrose p. 34)\n 1930: Kurt Gödel announces a proof as an answer to the first two of Hilbert's 1928 questions [cf Reid p. 198]. \"At first he [Hilbert] was only angry and frustrated, but then he began to try to deal constructively with the problem... Gödel himself felt—and expressed the thought in his paper—that his work did not contradict Hilbert's formalistic point of view\" (Reid p. 199)\n 1931: Gödel publishes \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\", (reprinted in Davis, 1965, p. 5ff)\n 19 April 1935: Alonzo Church publishes \"An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory\", wherein he identifies what it means for a function to be effectively calculable. Such a function will have an algorithm, and \"...the fact that the algorithm has terminated becomes effectively known ...\" (Davis, 1965, p. 100)\n 1936: Church publishes the first proof that the Entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable. (A Note on the Entscheidungsproblem, reprinted in Davis, 1965, p. 110.)\n 7 October 1936: Emil Post's paper \"Finite Combinatory Processes. Formulation I\" is received. Post adds to his \"process\" an instruction \"(C) Stop\". He called such a process \"type 1 ... if the process it determines terminates for each specific problem.\" (Davis, 1965, p. 289ff)\n 1937: Alan Turing's paper On Computable Numbers With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem reaches print in January 1937 (reprinted in Davis, 1965, p. 115). Turing's proof departs from calculation by recursive functions and introduces the notion of  computation by machine. Stephen Kleene (1952) refers to this as one of the \"first examples of decision problems proved unsolvable\".\n 1939: J. Barkley Rosser observes the essential equivalence of \"effective method\" defined by Gödel, Church, and Turing (Rosser in Davis, 1965, p. 273, \"Informal Exposition of Proofs of Gödel's Theorem and Church's Theorem\")\n 1943: In a paper, Stephen Kleene states that \"In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is describe a procedure ... which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, 'Yes' or 'No,' to the question, 'Is the predicate value true?'.\"\n 1952: Kleene (1952) Chapter XIII (\"Computable Functions\") includes a discussion of the unsolvability of the halting problem for Turing machines and reformulates it in terms of machines that \"eventually stop\", i.e. halt: \"... there is no algorithm for deciding whether any given machine, when started from any given situation, eventually stops.\" (Kleene (1952) p. 382)\n 1952: \"Martin Davis thinks it likely that he first used the term 'halting problem' in a series of lectures that he gave at the Control Systems Laboratory at the University of Illinois in 1952 (letter from Davis to Copeland, 12 December 2001).\" (Footnote 61 in Copeland (2004) pp. 40ff)\n\n Formalization \n\nIn his original proof Turing formalized the concept of algorithm by introducing Turing machines.  However, the result is in no way specific to them; it applies equally to any other model of computation that is equivalent in its computational power to Turing machines, such as Markov algorithms, Lambda calculus, Post systems, register machines, or tag systems.\n\nWhat is important is that the formalization allows a straightforward mapping of algorithms to some data type that the algorithm can operate upon.  For example, if the formalism lets algorithms define functions over strings (such as Turing machines) then there should be a mapping of these algorithms to strings, and if the formalism lets algorithms define functions over natural numbers (such as computable functions) then there should be a mapping of algorithms to natural numbers. The mapping to strings is usually the most straightforward, but strings over an alphabet with n characters can also be mapped to numbers by interpreting them as numbers in an n-ary numeral system.\n\n Representation as a set \n\nThe conventional representation of decision problems is the set of objects possessing the property in question. The halting set\n K = {(i, x) | program i halts when run on input x}\nrepresents the halting problem.\n\nThis set is recursively enumerable, which means there is a computable function that lists all of the pairs (i, x) it contains (Moore and Mertens 2011, pp. 236–237). However, the complement of this set is not recursively enumerable (Moore and Mertens 2011, pp. 236–237).\n\nThere are many equivalent formulations of the halting problem; any set whose Turing degree equals that of the halting problem is such a formulation.  Examples of such sets include:\n{i | program i eventually halts when run with input 0}\n{i | there is an input x such that program i eventually halts when run with input x}.\n\n Proof concept \n\nThe proof that the halting problem is not solvable is a proof by contradiction. To illustrate the concept of the proof, suppose that there exists a total computable function halts(f) that returns true if the subroutine f halts (when run with no inputs) and returns false otherwise. Now consider the following subroutine:\n\ndef g():\n    if halts(g):\n        loop_forever()\n\nhalts(g) must either return true or false, because halts was assumed to be total. If halts(g) returns true, then g will call loop_forever and never halt, which is a contradiction. If halts(g) returns false, then g will halt, because it will not call loop_forever; this is also a contradiction.  Overall, halts(g) can not return a truth value that is consistent with whether g halts. Therefore, the initial assumption that halts is a total computable function must be false.\n\nThe method used in the proof is called diagonalization - g does the opposite of what halts says g should do. The difference between this sketch and the actual proof is that in the actual proof, the computable function halts does not directly take a subroutine as an argument; instead it takes the source code of a program.  The actual proof requires additional work to handle this issue. Moreover, the actual proof avoids the direct use of recursion shown in the definition of g.\n\n Sketch of proof \n\nThe concept above shows the general method of the proof; this section will present additional details. The overall goal is to show that there is no total computable function that decides whether an arbitrary program i halts on arbitrary input x; that is, the following function h is not computable (Penrose 1990, p. 57–63):\n\nHere program i refers to the i th program in an enumeration of all the programs of a fixed Turing-complete model of computation.\n\n f(i,j) i 1 2 3 4 5 6 j 1 1\n  0\n  0\n  1\n  0\n  1 2\n  0 0\n  0\n  1\n  0\n  0 3\n  0\n  1 0\n  1\n  0\n  1 4\n  1\n  0\n  0 1\n  0\n  0 5\n  0\n  0\n  0\n  1 1\n  1 6\n  1\n  1\n  0\n  0\n  1 0 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    f(i,i) 1 0 0 1 1 0  g(i) U 0 0 U U 0\nPossible values for a total computable function f arranged in a 2D array. The orange cells are the diagonal. The values of f(i,i) and g(i) are shown at the bottom; U indicates that the function g is undefined for a particular input value.\n\nThe proof proceeds by directly establishing that no total computable function with two arguments can be the required function h.   As in the sketch of the concept, given any total computable binary function f, the following partial function g is also computable by some program e:\n\nThe verification that g is computable relies on the following constructs (or their equivalents):\n computable subprograms (the program that computes f is a subprogram in program e),\n duplication of values (program e computes the inputs i,i for f from the input i for g),\n conditional branching (program e selects between two results depending on the value it computes for f(i,i)),\n not producing a defined result (for example, by looping forever),\n returning a value of 0.\n\nThe following pseudocode illustrates a straightforward way to compute g:\n\nprocedure compute_g(i):\n    if f(i,i) == 0 then\n        return 0\n    else\n        loop forever\n\nBecause g is partial computable, there must be a program e that computes g, by the assumption that the model of computation is Turing-complete. This program is one of all the programs on which the halting function h is defined. The next step of the proof shows that h(e,e) will not have the same value as f(e,e).\n\nIt follows from the definition of g that exactly one of the following two cases must hold:\n f(e,e) = 0 and so g(e) = 0. In this case h(e,e) = 1,  because program e halts on input e.\n f(e,e) ≠ 0 and so g(e) is undefined. In this case h(e,e) = 0,  because program e does not halt on input e.\nIn either case, f cannot be the same function as h. Because f was an arbitrary total computable function with two arguments, all such functions must differ from h.\n\nThis proof is analogous to Cantor's diagonal argument. One may visualize a two-dimensional array with one column and one row for each natural number, as indicated in the table above. The value of f(i,j) is placed at column i, row j. Because f is assumed to be a total computable function, any element of the array can be calculated using f. The construction of the function g can be visualized using the main diagonal of this array.  If the array has a 0 at position (i,i), then g(i) is 0. Otherwise, g(i) is undefined. The contradiction comes from the fact that there is some column e of the array corresponding to g itself. Now assume f was the halting function h, if g(e) is defined (g(e) = 0 in this case), g(e) halts so f(e,e) = 1.  But g(e) = 0 only when f(e,e) = 0, contradicting f(e,e) = 1. Similarly, if g(e) is not defined, then halting function f(e,e) = 0, which leads to g(e) = 0 under gs construction. This contradicts the assumption of g(e) not being defined. In both cases contradiction arises. Therefore any arbitrary computable function f cannot be the halting function h.\n\nComputability theory\n\nThe typical method of proving a problem to be undecidable is with the technique of reduction.  To do this, it is sufficient to show that if a solution to the new problem were found, it could be used to decide an undecidable problem by transforming instances of the undecidable problem into instances of the new problem.  Since we already know that no method can decide the old problem, no method can decide the new problem either. Often the new problem is reduced to solving the halting problem. (Note: the same technique is used to demonstrate that a problem is NP complete, only in this case, rather than demonstrating that there is no solution, it demonstrates there is no polynomial time solution, assuming P ≠ NP).\n\nFor example, one such consequence of the halting problem's undecidability is that there cannot be a general algorithm that decides whether a given statement about natural numbers is true or not. The reason for this is that the proposition stating that a certain program will halt given a certain input can be converted into an equivalent statement about natural numbers. If we had an algorithm that could find the truth value of every statement about natural numbers, it could certainly find the truth value of this one; but that would determine whether the original program halts, which is impossible, since the halting problem is undecidable.\n\nRice's theorem generalizes the theorem that the halting problem is unsolvable. It states that for any non-trivial property, there is no general decision procedure that, for all programs, decides whether the partial function implemented by the input program has that property. (A partial function is a function which may not always produce a result, and so is used to model programs, which can either produce results or fail to halt.)  For example, the property \"halt for the input 0\" is undecidable. Here, \"non-trivial\" means that the set of partial functions that satisfy the property is neither the empty set nor the set of all partial functions. For example, \"halts or fails to halt on input 0\" is clearly true of all partial functions, so it is a trivial property, and can be decided by an algorithm that simply reports \"true.\" Also, note that this theorem holds only for properties of the partial function implemented by the program; Rice's Theorem does not apply to properties of the program itself. For example, \"halt on input 0 within 100 steps\" is not a property of the partial function that is implemented by the program—it is a property of the program implementing the partial function and is very much decidable.\n\nGregory Chaitin has defined a halting probability, represented by the symbol Ω, a type of real number that informally is said to represent the probability that a randomly produced program halts.  These numbers have the same Turing degree as the halting problem. It is a normal and transcendental number which can be defined but cannot be completely computed. This means one can prove that there is no algorithm which produces the digits of Ω, although its first few digits can be calculated in simple cases.\n\nWhile Turing's proof shows that there can be no general method or algorithm to determine whether algorithms halt, individual instances of that problem may very well be susceptible to attack. Given a specific algorithm, one can often show that it must halt for any input, and in fact computer scientists often do just that as part of a correctness proof. But each proof has to be developed specifically for the algorithm at hand; there is no mechanical, general way to determine whether algorithms on a Turing machine halt. However, there are some heuristics that can be used in an automated fashion to attempt to construct a proof, which succeed frequently on typical programs. This field of research is known as automated termination analysis.\n\nSince the negative answer to the halting problem shows that there are problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine, the Church–Turing thesis limits what can be accomplished by any machine that implements effective methods. However, not all machines conceivable to human imagination are subject to the Church–Turing thesis (e.g. oracle machines). It is an open question whether there can be actual deterministic physical processes that, in the long run, elude simulation by a Turing machine, and in particular whether any such hypothetical process could usefully be harnessed in the form of a calculating machine (a hypercomputer) that could solve the halting problem for a Turing machine amongst other things. It is also an open question whether any such unknown physical processes are involved in the working of the human brain, and whether humans can solve the halting problem (Copeland 2004, p. 15).\n\n Gödel's incompleteness theorems \n\n Generalization \n\nMany variants of the halting problem can be found in computability textbooks (e.g., Sipser 2006, Davis 1958, Minsky 1967, Hopcroft and Ullman 1979, Börger 1989). Typically their undecidability follows by reduction from the standard halting problem. However, some of them have a higher degree of unsolvability. The next two examples are typical.\n\n Halting on all inputs \n\nThe universal halting problem, also known (in recursion theory) as totality, is the problem of determining, whether a given computer program will halt for every input (the name totality comes from the equivalent question of whether the computed function is total).\nThis problem is not only undecidable, as the halting problem, but highly undecidable. In terms of the arithmetical hierarchy, it is -complete (Börger 1989, p. 121).\n\nThis means, in particular, that it cannot be decided even with an oracle for the halting problem.\n\n Recognizing partial solutions \n\nThere are many programs that, for some inputs, return a correct answer to the halting problem, while for other inputs they do not return an answer at all. \nHowever the problem \"given program p, is it a partial halting solver\" (in the sense described) is at least as hard as the halting problem.\nTo see this, assume that there is an algorithm PHSR (\"partial halting solver recognizer\") to do that. Then it can be used to solve the halting problem,\nas follows:\nTo test whether input program x halts on y, construct a program p that on input (x,y) reports true and diverges on all other inputs.\nThen test p with PHSR.\n\nThe above argument is a reduction of the halting problem to PHS recognition, and in the same manner, \nharder problems such as halting on all inputs can also be reduced, implying that PHS recognition is not only undecidable, but higher in the arithmetical hierarchy, specifically -complete.\n\n Lossy computation \nA lossy Turing machine''' is a Turing machine in which part of the tape may non-deterministically disappear. The Halting problem is decidable for lossy Turing machine but nonprimitive recursive.\n\n Oracle machines \n\nA machine with an oracle for the halting problem can determine whether particular Turing machines will halt on particular inputs, but they cannot determine, in general, if machines equivalent to themselves will halt.\n\n See also \n Busy beaver\n Gödel's incompleteness theorem\n Kolmogorov complexity\n P versus NP problem\n Optimal stopping\n Termination analysis\n Worst-case execution time\n\n Notes  \n\n References \n\n Alan Turing, On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem, Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, Series 2, Volume 42 (1937), pp 230–265, . — Alan Turing, On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.

      "text": "The history of logic deals with the study of the development of the science of valid inference (logic).  Formal logics developed in ancient times in India, China, and Greece. Greek methods, particularly Aristotelian logic (or term logic) as found in the Organon, found wide application and acceptance in Western science and mathematics for millennia.Boehner p. xiv The Stoics, especially Chrysippus, began the development of predicate logic.\n\nChristian and Islamic philosophers such as Boethius (died 524), Ibn Sina (Avicenna, died 1037) and William of Ockham (died 1347) further developed Aristotle's logic in the Middle Ages, reaching a high point in the mid-fourteenth century, with Jean Buridan. The period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century saw largely decline and neglect, and at least one historian of logic regards this time as barren.Oxford Companion p. 498; Bochenski, Part I Introduction, passim Empirical methods ruled the day, as evidenced by Sir Francis Bacon's Novum Organon of 1620.\n\nLogic revived in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period when the subject developed into a rigorous and formal discipline which took as its exemplar the exact method of proof used in mathematics, a hearkening back to the Greek tradition. The development of the modern \"symbolic\" or \"mathematical\" logic during this period by the likes of Boole, Frege, Russell, and Peano is the most significant in the two-thousand-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history.Oxford Companion p. 500\n\nProgress in mathematical logic in the first few decades of the twentieth century, particularly arising from the work of Gödel and Tarski, had a significant impact on analytic philosophy and philosophical logic, particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as modal logic, temporal logic, deontic logic, and relevance logic.\n\nLogic in the East\n\nLogic in India\n\nLogic began independently in ancient India and continued to develop to early modern times without any known influence from Greek logic.Bochenski p. 446 Medhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BC) founded the anviksiki school of logic.S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools, pp. 17–21. The Mahabharata (12.173.45), around the 5th century BC, refers to the anviksiki and tarka schools of logic.  (c. 5th century BC) developed a form of logic (to which Boolean logic has some similarities) for his formulation of Sanskrit grammar. Logic is described by Chanakya (c. 350-283 BC) in his Arthashastra as an independent field of inquiry.R. P. Kangle (1986). The Kautiliya Arthashastra (1.2.11). Motilal Banarsidass.\n\nTwo of the six Indian schools of thought deal with logic: Nyaya and Vaisheshika. The Nyaya Sutras of Aksapada Gautama (c. 2nd century AD) constitute the core texts of the Nyaya school, one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy. This realist school developed a rigid five-member schema of inference involving an initial premise, a reason, an example, an application, and a conclusion.Bochenski p. 417 and passim The idealist Buddhist philosophy became the chief opponent to the Naiyayikas. Nagarjuna (c. 150-250 AD), the founder of the Madhyamika (\"Middle Way\") developed an analysis known as the catuṣkoṭi (Sanskrit), a \"four-cornered\" system of argumentation that involves the systematic examination and rejection of each of the 4 possibilities of a proposition, P:\n P; that is, being.\n not P; that is, not being.\n P and not P; that is, being and not being.\n not (P or not P); that is, neither being nor not being.Under propositional logic, De Morgan's laws imply that this is equivalent to the third case (P and not P), and is therefore superfluous; there are actually only 3 cases to consider.\n\nHowever, Dignaga (c 480-540 AD) is sometimes said to have developed a formal syllogism,Bochenski pp. 431–7 and it was through him and his successor, Dharmakirti, that Buddhist logic reached its height; it is contested whether their analysis actually constitutes a formal syllogistic system. In particular, their analysis centered on the definition of an inference-warranting relation, \"vyapti\", also known as invariable concomitance or pervasion. To this end, a doctrine known as \"apoha\" or differentiation was developed.Bochenksi p. 441 This involved what might be called inclusion and exclusion of defining properties.\n\nDignāga's famous \"wheel of reason\" (Hetucakra) is a method of indicating when one thing (such as smoke) can be taken as an invariable sign of another thing (like fire), but the inference is often inductive and based on past observation. Matilal remarks that Dignāga's analysis is much like John Stuart Mill's Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, which is inductive.Matilal, 17\n\nIn addition, the traditional five-member Indian syllogism, though deductively valid, has repetitions that are unnecessary to its logical validity. As a result, some commentators see the traditional Indian syllogism as a rhetorical form that is entirely natural in many cultures of the world, and yet not as a logical form—not in the sense that all logically unnecessary elements have been omitted for the sake of analysis.\n\nLogic in China\n\nIn China, a contemporary of Confucius, Mozi, \"Master Mo\", is credited with founding the Mohist school, whose canons dealt with issues relating to valid inference and the conditions of correct conclusions. In particular, one of the schools that grew out of Mohism, the Logicians, are credited by some scholars for their early investigation of formal logic. Due to the harsh rule of Legalism in the subsequent Qin Dynasty, this line of investigation disappeared in China until the introduction of Indian philosophy by Buddhists.\n\nLogic in the West\n\nPrehistory of logic\nValid reasoning has been employed in all periods of human history. However, logic studies the principles of valid reasoning, inference and demonstration. It is probable that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with geometry, which originally meant the same as \"land measurement\".Kneale, p. 2 The ancient Egyptians discovered geometry, including the formula for the volume of a truncated pyramid.Kneale p. 3 Ancient Babylon was also skilled in mathematics. Esagil-kin-apli's medical Diagnostic Handbook in the 11th century BC was based on a logical set of axioms and assumptions,H. F. J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine, p. 99, Brill Publishers, . while Babylonian astronomers in the 8th and 7th centuries BC employed an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems, an important contribution to the philosophy of science.D. Brown (2000), Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology , Styx Publications, .\n\nAncient Greece before Aristotle\nWhile the ancient Egyptians empirically discovered some truths of geometry, the great achievement of the ancient Greeks was to replace empirical methods by demonstrative proof. Both Thales and Pythagoras of the Pre-Socratic philosophers seem aware of geometry's methods.\n\nFragments of early proofs are preserved in the works of Plato and Aristotle,Heath, Mathematics in Aristotle, cited in Kneale, p. 5 and the idea of a deductive system was probably known in the Pythagorean school and the Platonic Academy. The proofs of Euclid of Alexandria are a paradigm of Greek geometry. The three basic principles of geometry are as follows:\n\n Certain propositions must be accepted as true without demonstration; such a proposition is known as an axiom of geometry.\n Every proposition that is not an axiom of geometry must be demonstrated as following from the axioms of geometry; such a demonstration is known as a proof or a \"derivation\" of the proposition.\n The proof must be formal; that is, the derivation of the proposition must be independent of the particular subject matter in question.\nFurther evidence that early Greek thinkers were concerned with the principles of reasoning is found in the fragment called dissoi logoi, probably written at the beginning of the fourth century BC. This is part of a protracted debate about truth and falsity.Kneale, p. 16 In the case of the classical Greek city-states, interest in argumentation was also stimulated by the activities of the Rhetoricians or Orators and the Sophists, who used arguments to defend or attack a thesis, both in legal and political contexts.\nthumb|130px|left|Thales Theorem\n\nThales\nIt is said Thales, most widely regarded as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition,Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18. measured the height of the pyramids by their shadows at the moment when his own shadow was equal to his height. Thales was said to have had a sacrifice in celebration of discovering Thales' theorem just as Pythagoras had the Pythagorean theorem.Prof.T.Patronis & D.Patsopoulos \n\nThales is the first known individual to use deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to his theorem, and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. Indian and Babylonian mathematicians knew his theorem for special cases before he proved it.de Laet, Siegfried J. (1996). History of Humanity: Scientific and Cultural Development. UNESCO, Volume 3, p. 14.  It is believed that Thales learned that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle during his travels to Babylon.Boyer, Carl B. and Merzbach, Uta C. (2010). A History of Mathematics. John Wiley and Sons, Chapter IV. \n\nPythagoras\nthumb|180px|Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem in Euclid's Elements\nBefore 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met the c. 54 years older Thales.C. B. Boyer (1968) The systematic study of proof seems to have begun with the school of Pythagoras (i. e. the Pythagoreans) in the late sixth century BC.  Indeed, the Pythagoreans, believing all was number, are the first philosophers to emphasize form rather than matter.\n\nHeraclitus and Parmenides\nThe writing of Heraclitus (c. 535 – c. 475 BC) was the first place where the word logos was given special attention in ancient Greek philosophy,F.E. Peters, Greek Philosophical Terms, New York University Press, 1967. Heraclitus held that everything changes and all was fire  and conflicting opposites, seemingly unified only by this Logos. He is known for his obscure sayings.\n\nthumb|160px|Parmenides has been called the discoverer of logic.\nIn contrast to Heraclitus, Parmenides held that all is one and nothing changes. He may have been a dissident Pythagorean, disagreeing that One (a number) produced the many.http://www.bard.edu/library/arendt/pdfs/Cornford-Parmenides.pdf \"X is not\" must always be false or meaningless. What exists can in no way not exist.  Our sense perceptions with its noticing of generation and destruction are in grievous error. Instead of sense perception, Parmenides advocated logos as the means to Truth. He has been called the discoverer of logic,http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/From_religion_to_philosophy.pdf\nFor this view, that That Which Is Not exists, can never predominate. You must debar your thought from this way of search, nor let ordinary experience in its variety force you along this way, (namely, that of allowing) the eye, sightless as it is, and the ear, full of sound, and the tongue, to rule; but (you must) judge by means of the Reason (Logos) the much-contested proof which is expounded by me. (B 7.1–8.2)\n\nZeno of Elea, a pupil of Parmenides, had the idea of a standard argument pattern found in the method of proof known as reductio ad absurdum. This is the technique of drawing an obviously false (that is, \"absurd\") conclusion from an assumption, thus demonstrating that the assumption is false.Kneale p. 15 Therefore, Zeno and his teacher are seen as the first to apply the art of logic.   Plato's dialogue Parmenides portrays Zeno as claiming to have written a book defending the monism of Parmenides by demonstrating the absurd consequence of assuming that there is plurality. Zeno famously used this method to develop his paradoxes in his arguments against motion. Such dialectic reasoning later became popular. The members of this school were called \"dialecticians\" (from a Greek word meaning \"to discuss\").\n\nPlato\n\nalt=Mosaic: seven men standing under a tree|thumb|200px|Plato's Academy mosaic\nNone of the surviving works of the great fourth-century philosopher Plato (428–347 BC) include any formal logic,Kneale p. 17 but they include important contributions to the field of philosophical logic. Plato raises three questions:\n\n What is it that can properly be called true or false?\n What is the nature of the connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion?\n What is the nature of definition?\n\nThe first question arises in the dialogue Theaetetus, where Plato identifies thought or opinion with talk or discourse (logos).\"forming an opinion is talking, and opinion is speech that is held not with someone else or aloud but in silence with oneself\" Theaetetus 189E–190A The second question is a result of Plato's theory of Forms. Forms are not things in the ordinary sense, nor strictly ideas in the mind, but they correspond to what philosophers later called universals, namely an abstract entity common to each set of things that have the same name. In both the Republic and the Sophist, Plato suggests that the necessary connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion corresponds to a necessary connection between \"forms\".Kneale p. 20.  For example, the proof given in the Meno that the square on the diagonal is double the area of the original square presumably involves the forms of the square and the triangle, and the necessary relation between them The third question is about definition. Many of Plato's dialogues concern the search for a definition of some important concept (justice, truth, the Good), and it is likely that Plato was impressed by the importance of definition in mathematics.Kneale p. 21 What underlies every definition is a Platonic Form, the common nature present in different particular things. Thus, a definition reflects the ultimate object of understanding, and is the foundation of all valid inference. This had a great influence on Plato's student Aristotle, in particular Aristotle's notion of the essence of a thing.Zalta, Edward N. \"Aristotle's Logic\". Stanford University, 18 March 2000. Retrieved 13 March 2010.\n\nAristotle\nthumb|160px|Aristotle\nThe logic of Aristotle, and particularly his theory of the syllogism, has had an enormous influence in Western thought.See e.g. Aristotle's logic, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Aristotle was the first logician to attempt a systematic analysis of logical syntax, of noun (or term), and of verb. He was the first formal logician, in that he demonstrated the principles of reasoning by employing variables to show the underlying logical form of an argument. He sought relations of dependence which characterize necessary inference, and distinguished the validity of these relations, from the truth of the premises. He was the first to deal with the principles of contradiction and excluded middle in a systematic way.Bochenski p. 63 \nalt=Front cover of book, titled \"Aristotelis Logica\", with an illustration of eagle on a snake|240px|thumb|left|Aristotle's logic was still influential in the Renaissance\nThe Organon\nHis logical works, called the Organon, are the earliest formal study of logic that have come down to modern times. Though it is difficult to determine the dates, the probable order of writing of Aristotle's logical works is:\n The Categories, a study of the ten kinds of primitive term.\n The Topics (with an appendix called On Sophistical Refutations), a discussion of dialectics.\n On Interpretation, an analysis of simple categorical propositions into simple terms, negation, and signs of quantity. \n The Prior Analytics, a formal analysis of what makes a syllogism (a valid argument, according to Aristotle).\n The Posterior Analytics, a study of scientific demonstration, containing Aristotle's mature views on logic.\nthumb|180px|This diagram shows the contradictory relationships between categorical propositions in the square of opposition of Aristotelian logic.\nThese works are of outstanding importance in the history of logic. In the Categories, he attempts to discern all the possible things to which a term can refer; this idea underpins his philosophical work Metaphysics, which itself had a profound influence on Western thought.  \n\nHe also developed a theory of non-formal logic (i.e., the theory of fallacies), which is presented in Topics and Sophistical Refutations.\n\nOn Interpretation contains a comprehensive treatment of the notions of opposition and conversion; chapter 7 is at the origin of the square of opposition (or logical square); chapter 9 contains the beginning of modal logic.\n\nThe Prior Analytics contains his exposition of the \"syllogism\", where three important principles are applied for the first time in history: the use of variables, a purely formal treatment, and the use of an axiomatic system.\n\nStoics\n\nThe other great school of Greek logic is that of the Stoics.\"Throughout later antiquity two great schools of logic were distinguished, the Peripatetic which was derived from Aristotle, and the Stoic which was developed by Chrysippus from the teachings of the Megarians\" – Kneale p. 113 Stoic logic traces its roots back to the late 5th century BC philosopher Euclid of Megara, a pupil of Socrates and slightly older contemporary of Plato, probably following in the tradition of Parmenides and Zeno. His pupils and successors were called \"Megarians\", or \"Eristics\", and later the \"Dialecticians\". The two most important dialecticians of the Megarian school were Diodorus Cronus and Philo, who were active in the late 4th century BC. \nalt=Stone bust of a bearded, grave-looking man|thumb|160px|Chrysippus of Soli\nThe Stoics adopted the Megarian logic and systemized it. The most important member of the school was Chrysippus (c. 278–c. 206 BC), who was its third head, and who formalized much of Stoic doctrine.  He is supposed to have written over 700 works, including at least 300 on logic, almost none of which survive.Oxford Companion, article \"Chrysippus\", p. 134 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Susanne Bobzien, Ancient Logic Unlike with Aristotle, we have no complete works by the Megarians or the early Stoics, and have to rely mostly on accounts (sometimes hostile) by later sources, including prominently Diogenes Laërtius, Sextus Empiricus, Galen, Aulus Gellius, Alexander of Aphrodisias, and Cicero.K. Huelser, Die Fragmente zur Dialektik der Stoiker, 4 vols, Stuttgart 1986-7\n\nThree significant contributions of the Stoic school were (i) their account of modality, (ii) their theory of the Material conditional, and (iii) their account of meaning and truth.Kneale 117–158\n\n Modality. According to Aristotle, the Megarians of his day claimed there was no distinction between potentiality and actuality.Metaphysics Eta 3, 1046b 29  Diodorus Cronus defined the possible as that which either is or will be, the impossible as what will not be true, and the contingent as that which either is already, or will be false.Boethius, Commentary on the Perihermenias, Meiser p. 234 Diodorus is also famous for what is known as his Master argument, which states that each pair of the following 3 propositions contradicts the third proposition:\n Everything that is past is true and necessary.\n The impossible does not follow from the possible.\n What neither is nor will be is possible.\n Diodorus used the plausibility of the first two to prove that nothing is possible if it neither is nor will be true.Epictetus, Dissertationes ed. Schenkel ii. 19. I.  Chrysippus, by contrast, denied the second premise and said that the impossible could follow from the possible.Alexander p. 177\n\n Conditional statements. The first logicians to debate conditional statements were Diodorus and his pupil Philo of Megara. Sextus Empiricus refers three times to a debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded a conditional as true unless it has both a true antecedent and a false consequent. Precisely, let T0 and T1 be true statements, and let F0 and F1 be false statements; then, according to Philo, each of the following conditionals is a true statement, because it is not the case that the consequent is false while the antecedent is true (it is not the case that a false statement is asserted to follow from a true statement):\n If T0, then T1\n If F0, then T0\n If F0, then F1\n The following conditional does not meet this requirement, and is therefore a false statement according to Philo:\n If T0, then F0 Indeed, Sextus says \"According to [Philo], there are three ways in which a conditional may be true, and one in which it may be false.\"Sextus Empiricus, Adv. Math. viii, Section 113 Philo's criterion of truth is what would now be called a truth-functional definition of \"if ... then\"; it is the definition used in modern logic.\n\nIn contrast, Diodorus allowed the validity of conditionals only when the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion.Sextus Empiricus, Hypotyp. ii. 110, comp.Cicero, Academica, ii. 47, de Fato, 6. A century later, the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus attacked the assumptions of both Philo and Diodorus.\n Meaning and truth. The most important and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern propositional logic.See e.g. Lukasiewicz p. 21 The Stoics distinguished between utterance (phone), which may be noise, speech (lexis), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (logos), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory is the idea that what is expressed by a sentence, called a lekton, is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a proposition. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word Dion, and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.Sextus Bk viii., Sections 11, 12\n\nMedieval logic\n\nLogic in the Middle East\n\nalt=Arabic text in pink and blue|thumb|A text by Avicenna, founder of Avicennian logic \n\nThe works of Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Al-Ghazali, Averroes and other Muslim logicians were based on Aristotelian logic and were important in communicating the ideas of the ancient world to the medieval West.See e.g. Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy Online Version 2.0  , article 'Islamic philosophy' Al-Farabi (Alfarabi) (873–950) was an Aristotelian logician who discussed the topics of future contingents, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between logic and grammar, and non-Aristotelian forms of inference. Al-Farabi also considered the theories of conditional syllogisms and analogical inference, which were part of the Stoic tradition of logic rather than the Aristotelian. [726]. \n\nIbn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037) was the founder of Avicennian logic, which replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world, and also had an important influence on Western medieval writers such as Albertus Magnus.Richard F. Washell (1973), \"Logic, Language, and Albert the Great\", Journal of the History of Ideas 34 (3), pp. 445–450 [445]. Avicenna wrote on the hypothetical syllogism and on the propositional calculus, which were both part of the Stoic logical tradition.Goodman, Lenn Evan (1992); Avicenna, p. 188, Routledge, . He developed an original \"temporally modalized\" syllogistic theory, involving temporal logic and modal logic.History of logic: Arabic logic, Encyclopædia Britannica. He also made use of inductive logic, such as the methods of agreement, difference, and concomitant variation which are critical to the scientific method.Goodman, Lenn Evan (2003), Islamic Humanism, p. 155, Oxford University Press, . One of Avicenna's ideas had a particularly important influence on Western logicians such as William of Ockham: Avicenna's word for a meaning or notion (ma'na), was translated by the scholastic logicians as the Latin intentio; in medieval logic and epistemology, this is a sign in the mind that naturally represents a thing.Kneale p. 229 This was crucial to the development of Ockham's conceptualism: A universal term (e.g., \"man\") does not signify a thing existing in reality, but rather a sign in the mind (intentio in intellectu) which represents many things in reality; Ockham cites Avicenna's commentary on Metaphysics V in support of this view.Kneale: p. 266; Ockham: Summa Logicae i. 14; Avicenna: Avicennae Opera Venice 1508 f87rb\n\nFakhr al-Din al-Razi (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle's \"first figure\" and formulated an early system of inductive logic, foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by John Stuart Mill (1806–1873).Muhammad Iqbal, The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, \"The Spirit of Muslim Culture\" (cf.  and ) Al-Razi's work was seen by later Islamic scholars as marking a new direction for Islamic logic, towards a Post-Avicennian logic. This was further elaborated by his student Afdaladdîn al-Khûnajî (d. 1249), who developed a form of logic revolving around the subject matter of conceptions and assents. In response to this tradition, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) began a tradition of Neo-Avicennian logic which remained faithful to Avicenna's work and existed as an alternative to the more dominant Post-Avicennian school over the following centuries.\n\nThe Illuminationist school was founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1155–1191), who developed the idea of \"decisive necessity\", which refers to the reduction of all modalities (necessity, possibility, contingency and impossibility) to the single mode of necessity.Dr. Lotfollah Nabavi, Sohrevardi's Theory of Decisive Necessity and kripke's QSS System , Journal of Faculty of Literature and Human Sciences. Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288) wrote a book on Avicennian logic, which was a commentary of Avicenna's Al-Isharat (The Signs) and  Al-Hidayah (The Guidance).Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), \"Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher\", Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis, Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait (cf. Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher , Encyclopedia of Islamic World). Ibn Taymiyyah (1263–1328), wrote the Ar-Radd 'ala al-Mantiqiyyin, where he argued against the usefulness, though not the validity, of the syllogismSee pp. 253–254 of  and in favour of inductive reasoning. Ibn Taymiyyah also argued against the certainty of syllogistic arguments and in favour of analogy; his argument is that concepts founded on induction are themselves not certain but only probable, and thus a syllogism based on such concepts is no more certain than an argument based on analogy. He further claimed that induction itself is founded on a process of analogy. His model of analogical reasoning was based on that of juridical arguments., pp. 16-36 This model of analogy has been used in the recent work of John F. Sowa.\n\nThe Sharh al-takmil fi'l-mantiq written by Muhammad ibn Fayd Allah ibn Muhammad Amin al-Sharwani in the 15th century is the last major Arabic work on logic that has been studied.Nicholas Rescher and Arnold vander Nat, \"The Arabic Theory of Temporal Modal Syllogistic\", in George Fadlo Hourani (1975), Essays on Islamic Philosophy and Science, pp. 189–221, State University of New York Press, . However, \"thousands upon thousands of pages\" on logic were written between the 14th and 19th centuries, though only a fraction of the texts written during this period have been studied by historians, hence little is known about the original work on Islamic logic produced during this later period.\n\nLogic in medieval Europe\nalt=Top left corner of early printed text, with an illuminated S, beginning \"Sicut dicit philosophus\"|thumb|Brito's questions on the Old Logic\n\n\"Medieval logic\" (also known as \"Scholastic logic\") generally means the form of Aristotelian logic developed in medieval Europe throughout roughly the period 1200–1600. For centuries after Stoic logic had been formulated, it was the dominant system of logic in the classical world. When the study of logic resumed after the Dark Ages, the main source was the work of the Christian philosopher Boethius, who was familiar with some of Aristotle's logic, but almost none of the work of the Stoics.Kneale p. 198  Until the twelfth century, the only works of Aristotle available in the West were the Categories, On Interpretation, and Boethius's translation of the Isagoge of Porphyry (a commentary on the Categories). These works were known as the \"Old Logic\" (Logica Vetus or Ars Vetus). An important work in this tradition was the Logica Ingredientibus of Peter Abelard (1079–1142).  His direct influence was small,Stephen Dumont, article \"Peter Abelard\" in Gracia and Noone p. 492 but his influence through pupils such as John of Salisbury was great, and his method of applying rigorous logical analysis to theology shaped the way that theological criticism developed in the period that followed.Kneale, pp. 202–3\n\nBy the early thirteenth century, the remaining works of Aristotle's Organon (including the Prior Analytics, Posterior Analytics, and the Sophistical Refutations) had been recovered in the West.See e.g. Kneale p. 225  Logical work until then was mostly paraphrasis or commentary on the work of Aristotle.Boehner p. 1 The period from the middle of the thirteenth to the middle of the fourteenth century was one of significant developments in logic, particularly in three areas which were original, with little foundation in the Aristotelian tradition that came before.  These were:Boehner pp. 19–76\n\n The theory of supposition. Supposition theory deals with the way that predicates (e.g., 'man') range over a domain of individuals (e.g., all men).Boehner p. 29  In the proposition 'every man is an animal', does the term 'man' range over or 'supposit for' men existing just in the present, or does the range include past and future men? Can a term supposit for a non-existing individual?  Some medievalists have argued that this idea is a precursor of modern first-order logic.Boehner p. 30 \"The theory of supposition with the associated theories of copulatio (sign-capacity of adjectival terms), ampliatio (widening of referential domain), and distributio constitute one of the most original achievements of Western medieval logic\".Ebbesen 1981\n The theory of syncategoremata.  Syncategoremata are terms which are necessary for logic, but which, unlike categorematic terms, do not signify on their own behalf, but 'co-signify' with other words.  Examples of syncategoremata are 'and', 'not', 'every', 'if', and so on.\n The theory of consequences.  A consequence is a hypothetical, conditional proposition: two propositions joined by the terms 'if ... then'.  For example, 'if a man runs, then God exists' (Si homo currit, Deus est).Boehner pp. 54–5  A fully developed theory of consequences is given in Book III of William of Ockham's work Summa Logicae.  There, Ockham distinguishes between 'material' and 'formal' consequences, which are roughly equivalent to the modern material implication and logical implication respectively.  Similar accounts are given by Jean Buridan and Albert of Saxony.\n\nThe last great works in this tradition are the Logic of John Poinsot (1589–1644, known as John of St Thomas), the Metaphysical Disputations of Francisco Suarez (1548–1617), and the Logica Demonstrativa of Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri (1667–1733).\n\nTraditional logic\n\nThe textbook tradition\nalt=Frontispiece, with title beginning \"The Artes of Logike and Rethorike, plainlie set foorth in the English tounge, easie to be learned and practised\".|thumb|Dudley Fenner's Art of Logic (1584)Traditional logic generally means the textbook tradition that begins with Antoine Arnauld's and Pierre Nicole's Logic, or the Art of Thinking, better known as the Port-Royal Logic.Oxford Companion p. 504, article \"Traditional logic\" Published in 1662, it was the most influential work on logic after Aristotle until the nineteenth century.Buroker xxiii The book presents a loosely Cartesian doctrine (that the proposition is a combining of ideas rather than terms, for example) within a framework that is broadly derived from Aristotelian and medieval term logic. Between 1664 and 1700, there were eight editions, and the book had considerable influence after that.  The Port-Royal introduces the concepts of extension and intension. The account of propositions that Locke gives in the Essay is essentially that of the Port-Royal:  \"Verbal propositions, which are words, [are] the signs of our ideas, put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences. So that proposition consists in the putting together or separating these signs, according as the things which they stand for agree or disagree.\"(Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, IV. 5. 6)\n\nDudley Fenner helped popularize Ramist logic, a reaction against Aristotle. Another influential work was the Novum Organum by Francis Bacon, published in 1620. The title translates as \"new instrument\". This is a reference to Aristotle's work known as the Organon. In this work, Bacon rejects the syllogistic method of Aristotle in favor of an alternative procedure \"which by slow and faithful toil gathers information from things and brings it into understanding\".Farrington, 1964, 89 This method is known as inductive reasoning, a method which starts from empirical observation and proceeds to lower axioms or propositions; from these lower axioms, more general ones can be induced. For example, in finding the cause of a phenomenal nature such as heat, 3 lists should be constructed:\n The presence list: a list of every situation where heat is found.\n The absence list: a list of every situation that is similar to at least one of those of the presence list, except for the lack of heat.\n The variability list: a list of every situation where heat can vary.\nThen, the form nature (or cause) of heat may be defined as that which is common to every situation of the presence list, and which is lacking from every situation of the absence list, and which varies by degree in every situation of the variability list.\n\nOther works in the textbook tradition include Isaac Watts's Logick: Or, the Right Use of Reason (1725), Richard Whately's Logic (1826), and John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic (1843).  Although the latter was one of the last great works in the tradition, Mill's view that the foundations of logic lie in introspectionN. Abbagnano, \"Psychologism\" in P. Edwards (ed) The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, MacMillan, 1967  influenced the view that logic is best understood as a branch of psychology, a view which dominated the next fifty years of its development, especially in Germany.Of the German literature in this period, Robert Adamson wrote \"Logics swarm as bees in springtime...\"; Robert Adamson, A Short History of Logic, Wm. Blackwood & Sons, 1911, page 242\n\nLogic in Hegel's philosophy\nthumb|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\nG.W.F. Hegel indicated the importance of logic to his philosophical system when he condensed his extensive Science of Logic into a shorter work published in 1817 as the first volume of his Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences.  The \"Shorter\" or \"Encyclopaedia\" Logic, as it is often known, lays out a series of transitions which leads from the most empty and abstract of categories—Hegel begins with \"Pure Being\" and \"Pure Nothing\"—to the \"Absolute, the category which contains and resolves all the categories which preceded it.  Despite the title, Hegel's Logic is not really a contribution to the science of valid inference.  Rather than deriving conclusions about concepts through valid inference from premises, Hegel seeks to show that thinking about one concept compels thinking about another concept (one cannot, he argues, possess the concept of \"Quality\" without the concept of \"Quantity\"); this compulsion is, supposedly, not a matter of individual psychology, because it arises almost organically from the content of the concepts themselves.  His purpose is to show the rational structure of the \"Absolute\"—indeed of rationality itself.  The method by which thought is driven from one concept to its contrary, and then to further concepts, is known as the Hegelian dialectic.\n\nAlthough Hegel's Logic has had little impact on mainstream logical studies, its influence can be seen elsewhere:\n Carl von Prantl's Geschichte der Logik in Abendland (1855–1867).Carl von Prantl (1855-1867), Geschichte von Logik in Abendland, Leipsig:  S. Hirzl, anastatically reprinted in 1997, Hildesheim:  Georg Olds.\n The work of the British Idealists, such as F.H. Bradley's Principles of Logic (1883).\n The economic, political, and philosophical studies of Karl Marx, and in the various schools of Marxism.\n\nLogic and psychology\nBetween the work of Mill and Frege stretched half a century during which logic was widely treated as a descriptive science, an empirical study of the structure of reasoning, and thus essentially as a branch of psychology.See e.g. Psychologism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  The German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, for example, discussed deriving \"the logical from the psychological laws of thought\", emphasizing that \"psychological thinking is always the more comprehensive form of thinking.\"Wilhelm Wundt, Logik (1880–1883); quoted in Edmund Husserl, Logical Investigations, translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, pp. 115–116.  This view was widespread among German philosophers of the period:\n Theodor Lipps described logic as \"a specific discipline of psychology\".Theodor Lipps, Grundzüge der Logik (1893); quoted in Edmund Husserl, Logical Investigations, translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 40\n Christoph von Sigwart understood logical necessity as grounded in the individual's compulsion to think in a certain way.Christoph von Sigwart, Logik (1873–78); quoted in Edmund Husserl, Logical Investigations, translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 51\n Benno Erdmann argued that \"logical laws only hold within the limits of our thinking\".Benno Erdmann, Logik (1892); quoted in Edmund Husserl, Logical Investigations, translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 96\nSuch was the dominant view of logic in the years following Mill's work.Dermot Moran, \"Introduction\"; Edmund Husserl, Logical Investigations, translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. xxi  This psychological approach to logic was rejected by Gottlob Frege.  It was also subjected to an extended and destructive critique by Edmund Husserl in the first volume of his Logical Investigations (1900), an assault which has been described as \"overwhelming\".Michael Dummett, \"Preface\"; Edmund Husserl, Logical Investigations, translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. xvii  Husserl argued forcefully that grounding logic in psychological observations implied that all logical truths remained unproven, and that skepticism and relativism were unavoidable consequences.\n\nSuch criticisms did not immediately extirpate what is called \"psychologism\". For example, the American philosopher Josiah Royce, while acknowledging the force of Husserl's critique, remained \"unable to doubt\" that progress in psychology would be accompanied by progress in logic, and vice versa.Josiah Royce, \"Recent Logical Enquiries and their Psychological Bearings\" (1902) in John J. McDermott (ed) The Basic Writings of Josiah Royce Volume 2, Fordham University Press, 2005, p. 661\n\nRise of modern logic\nThe period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century had been largely one of decline and neglect, and is generally regarded as barren by historians of logic.  The revival of logic occurred in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period where the subject developed into a rigorous and formalistic discipline whose exemplar was the exact method of proof used in mathematics. The development of the modern \"symbolic\" or \"mathematical\" logic during this period is the most significant in the 2000-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history.\n\nA number of features distinguish modern logic from the old Aristotelian or traditional logic, the most important of which are as follows:Bochenski, p. 266  Modern logic is fundamentally a calculus  whose rules of operation are determined only by the shape and not by the meaning of the symbols it employs, as in mathematics.  Many logicians were impressed by the \"success\" of mathematics, in that there had been no prolonged dispute about any truly mathematical result. C.S. Peirce notedPeirce 1896 that even though a mistake in the evaluation of a definite integral by Laplace led to an error concerning the moon's orbit that persisted for nearly 50 years, the mistake, once spotted, was corrected without any serious dispute.  Peirce contrasted this with the disputation and uncertainty surrounding traditional logic, and especially reasoning in metaphysics. He argued that a truly \"exact\" logic would depend upon mathematical, i.e., \"diagrammatic\" or \"iconic\" thought.  \"Those who follow such methods will ... escape all error except such as will be speedily corrected after it is once suspected\".  Modern logic is also \"constructive\" rather than \"abstractive\"; i.e., rather than abstracting and formalising theorems derived from ordinary language (or from psychological intuitions about validity), it constructs theorems by formal methods, then looks for an interpretation in ordinary language. It is entirely symbolic, meaning that even the logical constants (which the medieval logicians called \"syncategoremata\") and the categoric terms are expressed in symbols.\n\nModern logic\nThe development of modern logic falls into roughly five periods:See Bochenski p. 269\n The embryonic period from Leibniz to 1847, when the notion of a logical calculus was discussed and developed, particularly by Leibniz, but no schools were formed, and isolated periodic attempts were abandoned or went unnoticed.\n The algebraic period from Boole's Analysis to Schröder's Vorlesungen.  In this period, there were more practitioners, and a greater continuity of development.\n The logicist period from the Begriffsschrift of Frege to the Principia Mathematica of Russell and Whitehead. The aim of the \"logicist school\" was to incorporate the logic of all mathematical and scientific discourse in a single unified system which, taking as a fundamental principle that all mathematical truths are logical, did not accept any non-logical terminology.  The major logicists were Frege, Russell, and the early Wittgenstein.Oxford Companion p. 499 It culminates with the Principia, an important work which includes a thorough examination and attempted solution of the antinomies which had been an obstacle to earlier progress.\n The metamathematical period from 1910 to the 1930s, which saw the development of metalogic, in the finitist system of Hilbert, and the non-finitist system of Löwenheim and Skolem, the combination of logic and metalogic in the work of Gödel and Tarski.  Gödel's incompleteness theorem of 1931 was one of the greatest achievements in the history of logic.  Later in the 1930s, Gödel developed the notion of set-theoretic constructibility.\n The period after World War II, when mathematical logic branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: model theory, proof theory, computability theory, and set theory, and its ideas and methods began to influence philosophy.\n\nEmbryonic period\nthumb|upright|Leibniz\nThe idea that inference could be represented by a purely mechanical process is found as early as Raymond Llull, who proposed a (somewhat eccentric) method of drawing conclusions by a system of concentric rings.  The work of logicians such as the Oxford CalculatorsEdith Sylla (1999), \"Oxford Calculators\", in The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire:  Cambridge. led to a method of using letters instead of writing out logical calculations (calculationes) in words, a method used, for instance, in the Logica magna by Paul of Venice.  Three hundred years after Llull, the English philosopher and logician Thomas Hobbes suggested that all logic and reasoning could be reduced to the mathematical operations of addition and subtraction.El. philos. sect. I de corp 1.1.2. The same idea is found in the work of Leibniz, who had read both Llull and Hobbes, and who argued that logic can be represented through a combinatorial process or calculus.  But, like Llull and Hobbes, he failed to develop a detailed or comprehensive system, and his work on this topic was not published until long after his death. Leibniz says that ordinary languages are subject to \"countless ambiguities\" and are unsuited for a calculus, whose task is to expose mistakes in inference arising from the forms and structures of words;Bochenski p. 274 hence, he proposed to identify an alphabet of human thought comprising fundamental concepts which could be composed to express complex ideas,Rutherford, Donald, 1995, \"Philosophy and language\" in Jolley, N., ed., The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz. Cambridge Univ. Press. and create a calculus ratiocinator that would make all arguments \"as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate.\"Wiener, Philip, 1951. Leibniz: Selections. Scribner.\n\nGergonne (1816) said that reasoning does not have to be about objects about which one has perfectly clear ideas, because algebraic operations can be carried out without having any idea of the meaning of the symbols involved.Essai de dialectique rationelle, 211n, quoted in Bochenski p. 277. Bolzano anticipated a fundamental idea of modern proof theory when he defined logical consequence or \"deducibility\" in terms of variables:Hence I say that propositions , , ,… are deducible from propositions , , , ,… with respect to variable parts , ,…, if every class of ideas whose substitution for , ,… makes all of , , , ,… true, also makes all of , , ,… true. Occasionally, since it is customary, I shall say that propositions , , ,… follow, or can be inferred or derived, from , , , ,…. Propositions , , , ,… I shall call the premises, , , ,… the conclusions.This is now known as semantic validity.\n\nAlgebraic period\nthumb|140px|George Boole\nModern logic begins with what is known as the \"algebraic school\", originating with Boole and including Peirce, Jevons, Schröder, and Venn.See e.g. Bochenski p. 296 and passim Their objective was to develop a calculus to formalise reasoning in the area of classes, propositions, and probabilities.  The school begins with Boole's seminal work Mathematical Analysis of Logic which appeared in 1847, although De Morgan (1847) is its immediate precursor.Before publishing, he wrote to De Morgan, who was just finishing his work Formal Logic.  De Morgan suggested they should publish first, and thus the two books appeared at the same time, possibly even reaching the bookshops on the same day. cf. Kneale p. 404 The fundamental idea of Boole's system is that algebraic formulae can be used to express logical relations.  This idea occurred to Boole in his teenage years, working as an usher in a private school in Lincoln, Lincolnshire.Kneale p. 404  For example, let x and y stand for classes let the symbol = signify that the classes have the same members, xy stand for the class containing all and only the members of x and y and so on.  Boole calls these elective symbols, i.e. symbols which select certain objects for consideration.Kneale p. 407  An expression in which elective symbols are used is called an elective function, and an equation of which the members are elective functions, is an elective equation.Boole (1847) p. 16 The theory of elective functions and their \"development\" is essentially the modern idea of truth-functions and their expression in disjunctive normal form.\n\nBoole's system admits of two interpretations, in class logic, and propositional logic.  Boole distinguished between \"primary propositions\" which are the subject of syllogistic theory, and \"secondary propositions\", which are the subject of propositional logic, and showed how under different \"interpretations\" the same algebraic system could represent both. An example of a primary proposition is \"All inhabitants are either Europeans or Asiatics.\"  An example of a secondary proposition is \"Either all inhabitants are Europeans or they are all Asiatics.\"Boole 1847 pp. 58–9  These are easily distinguished in modern propositional calculus, where it is also possible to show that the first follows from the second, but it is a significant disadvantage that there is no way of representing this in the Boolean system.Beaney p. 11\n\nIn his Symbolic Logic (1881), John Venn used diagrams of overlapping areas to express Boolean relations between classes or truth-conditions of propositions. In 1869 Jevons realised that Boole's methods could be mechanised, and constructed a \"logical machine\" which he showed to the Royal Society the following year.  In 1885 Allan Marquand proposed an electrical version of the machine that is still extant (picture at the Firestone Library).\nleft|thumb|160px|Charles Sanders Peirce\nThe defects in Boole's system (such as the use of the letter v for existential propositions) were all remedied by his followers.  Jevons published Pure Logic, or the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity in 1864, where he suggested a symbol to signify exclusive or, which allowed Boole's system to be greatly simplified.Kneale p. 422  This was usefully exploited by Schröder when he set out theorems in parallel columns in his Vorlesungen (1890–1905).  Peirce (1880) showed how all the Boolean elective functions could be expressed by the use of a single primitive binary operation, \"neither ... nor ...\" and equally well \"not both ... and ...\",Peirce, \"A Boolean Algebra with One Constant\", 1880 MS, Collected Papers v. 4, paragraphs 12–20, reprinted Writings v. 4, pp. 218-21. Google Preview. however, like many of Peirce's innovations, this remained unknown or unnoticed until Sheffer rediscovered it in 1913.Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., xiv (1913), pp. 481–8. This is now known as the Sheffer stroke  Boole's early work also lacks the idea of the logical sum which originates in Peirce (1867), Schröder (1877) and Jevons (1890),Bochenski 296 and the concept of inclusion, first suggested by Gergonne (1816) and clearly articulated by Peirce (1870).\nalt=Coloured diagram of 4 interlocking sets|right|thumb|250px|Boolean multiples\nThe success of Boole's algebraic system suggested that all logic must be capable of algebraic representation, and there were attempts to express a logic of relations in such form, of which the most ambitious was Schröder's monumental Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik (\"Lectures on the Algebra of Logic\", vol iii 1895), although the original idea was again anticipated by Peirce.See CP III\n\nBoole's unwavering acceptance of Aristotle's logic is emphasized by the historian of logic John Corcoran in an accessible introduction to Laws of ThoughtGeorge Boole. 1854/2003. The Laws of Thought, facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in Philosophy in Review.24 (2004) 167–169. Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of Prior Analytics and Laws of Thought.JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol. 24 (2003), pp. 261–288. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole's goals were \"to go under, over, and beyond\" Aristotle's logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations, 2) extending the class of problems it could treat — from assessing validity to solving equations — and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle — e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.\n\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what Aristotle said; Boole's 'disagreements', if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. \nFirst, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotelian logic to formulas in the form of equations — by itself a revolutionary idea. \nSecond, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic — another revolutionary idea — involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the \"perfect syllogisms\") must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. \nThird, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce \"No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus\" from \"No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle\" or from \"No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle\".\n\nLogicist period\nthumb|160px|Gottlob Frege.\nAfter Boole, the next great advances were made by the German mathematician Gottlob Frege. Frege's objective was the program of Logicism, i.e. demonstrating that arithmetic is identical with logic.Kneale p. 435  Frege went much further than any of his predecessors in his rigorous and formal approach to logic, and his calculus or Begriffsschrift is important. Frege also tried to show that the concept of number can be defined by purely logical means, so that (if he was right) logic includes arithmetic and all branches of mathematics that are reducible to arithmetic.  He was not the first writer to suggest this.  In his pioneering work Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik (The Foundations of Arithmetic), sections 15–17, he acknowledges the efforts of Leibniz, J.S. Mill as well as Jevons, citing the latter's claim that \"algebra is a highly developed logic, and number but logical discrimination.\"Jevons, The Principles of Science, London 1879, p. 156, quoted in Grundlagen 15\n\nFrege's first work, the Begriffsschrift (\"concept script\") is a rigorously axiomatised system of propositional logic, relying on just two connectives (negational and conditional), two rules of inference (modus ponens and substitution), and six axioms.  Frege referred to the \"completeness\" of this system, but was unable to prove this.Beaney p. 10 – the completeness of Frege's system was eventually proved by Jan Łukasiewicz in 1934  The most significant innovation, however, was his explanation of the quantifier in terms of mathematical functions.  Traditional logic regards the sentence \"Caesar is a man\" as of fundamentally the same form as \"all men are mortal.\"  Sentences with a proper name subject were regarded as universal in character, interpretable as \"every Caesar is a man\".See for example the argument by the medieval logician William of Ockham that singular propositions are universal, in Summa Logicae III. 8 (??)  At the outset Frege abandons the traditional \"concepts subject and predicate\", replacing them with argument and function respectively, which he believes \"will stand the test of time. It is easy to see how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of the connection between the meanings of the words if, and, not, or, there is, some, all, and so forth, deserves attention\". in  Frege argued that the quantifier expression \"all men\" does not have the same logical or semantic form as \"all men\", and that the universal proposition \"every A is B\" is a complex proposition involving two functions, namely ' – is A' and ' – is B' such that whatever satisfies the first, also satisfies the second.  In modern notation, this would be expressed as\n\n \n\nIn English, \"for all x, if Ax then Bx\".  Thus only singular propositions are of subject-predicate form, and they are irreducibly singular, i.e. not reducible to a general proposition.  Universal and particular propositions, by contrast, are not of simple subject-predicate form at all.  If \"all mammals\" were the logical subject of the sentence \"all mammals are land-dwellers\", then to negate the whole sentence we would have to negate the predicate to give \"all mammals are not land-dwellers\".  But this is not the case.\"On concept and object\" p. 198; Geach p. 48  This functional analysis of ordinary-language sentences later had a great impact on philosophy and linguistics.\n\nThis means that in Frege's calculus, Boole's \"primary\" propositions can be represented in a different way from \"secondary\" propositions.  \"All inhabitants are either men or women\" is\n130px|alt=Straight line with bend; text \"x\" over bend; text \"F(x)\" to the right of the line.|thumb|Frege's \"Concept Script\"\n \n\nwhereas \"All the inhabitants are men or all the inhabitants are women\" is\n\n \n\nAs Frege remarked in a critique of Boole's calculus:\n\n \"The real difference is that I avoid [the Boolean] division into two parts ... and give a homogeneous presentation of the lot.  In Boole the two parts run alongside one another, so that one is like the mirror image of the other, but for that very reason stands in no organic relation to it'BLC p. 14, quoted in Beaney p. 12\n\nAs well as providing a unified and comprehensive system of logic, Frege's calculus also resolved the ancient problem of multiple generality.  The ambiguity of \"every girl kissed a boy\" is difficult to express in traditional logic, but Frege's logic resolves this through the different scope of the quantifiers.  Thus\n\nthumb|120px|Peano\nmeans that to every girl there corresponds some boy (any one will do) who the girl kissed. But\n\nmeans that there is some particular boy whom every girl kissed. Without this device, the project of logicism would have been doubtful or impossible.  Using it, Frege provided a definition of the ancestral relation, of the many-to-one relation, and of mathematical induction.See e.g. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, article \"Frege\"\nthumb|left|130px|Ernst Zermelo\nThis period overlaps with the work of what is known as the \"mathematical school\", which included Dedekind, Pasch, Peano, Hilbert, Zermelo, Huntington, Veblen and Heyting. Their objective was the axiomatisation of branches of mathematics like geometry, arithmetic, analysis and set theory. Most notable was Hilbert's Program, which sought to ground all of mathematics to a finite set of axioms, proving its consistency by \"finitistic\" means and providing a procedure which would decide the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor. Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols. While unaware of Frege's work, he independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schröder.Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 83\n\nThe logicist project received a near-fatal setback with the discovery of a paradox in 1901 by Bertrand Russell.  This proved Frege's naive set theory led to a contradiction.  Frege's theory contained the axiom that for any formal criterion, there is a set of all objects that meet the criterion.  Russell showed that a set containing exactly the sets that are not members of themselves would contradict its own definition (if it is not a member of itself, it is a member of itself, and if it is a member of itself, it is not).See e.g. Potter 2004 This contradiction is now known as Russell's paradox. One important method of resolving this paradox was proposed by Ernst Zermelo.Zermelo 1908 Zermelo set theory was the first axiomatic set theory. It was developed into the now-canonical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF). Russell's paradox symbolically is as follows:\n\nThe monumental Principia Mathematica, a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics, written by Russell and Alfred North Whitehead and published 1910–13 also included an attempt to resolve the paradox, by means of an elaborate system of types: a set of elements is of a different type than is each of its elements (set is not the element; one element is not the set) and one cannot speak of the \"set of all sets\".  The Principia was an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic.\n\nMetamathematical period\nthumb|130px|right|Kurt Gödel\nThe names of Gödel and Tarski dominate the 1930s,Feferman 1999 p. 1 a crucial period in the development of metamathematics – the study of mathematics using mathematical methods to produce metatheories, or mathematical theories about other mathematical theories.  Early investigations into metamathematics had been driven by Hilbert's program. Work on metamathematics culminated in the work of Gödel, who in 1929 showed that a given first-order sentence is deducible if and only if it is logically valid – i.e. it is true in every structure for its language.  This is known as Gödel's completeness theorem.  A year later, he proved two important theorems, which showed Hibert's program to be unattainable in its original form.  The first is that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure such as an algorithm or computer program is capable of proving all facts about the natural numbers.  For any such system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second is that if such a system is also capable of proving certain basic facts about the natural numbers, then the system cannot prove the consistency of the system itself.  These two results are known as Gödel's incompleteness theorems, or simply Gödel's Theorem.  Later in the decade, Gödel developed the concept of set-theoretic constructibility, as part of his proof that the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are consistent with Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.\n\nIn proof theory, Gerhard Gentzen developed natural deduction and the sequent calculus.  The former attempts to model logical reasoning as it 'naturally' occurs in practice and is most easily applied to intuitionistic logic, while the latter was devised to clarify the derivation of logical proofs in any formal system.  Since Gentzen's work, natural deduction and sequent calculi have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic and computer science.  Gentzen also proved normalization and cut-elimination theorems for intuitionistic and classical logic which could be used to reduce logical proofs to a normal form.\nright|200px|alt=Balding man, with bookshelf in background|thumb|Alfred Tarski\nAlfred Tarski, a pupil of Łukasiewicz, is best known for his definition of truth and logical consequence, and the semantic concept of logical satisfaction.  In 1933, he published (in Polish) The concept of truth in formalized languages, in which he proposed his semantic theory of truth: a sentence such as \"snow is white\" is true if and only if snow is white.  Tarski's theory separated the metalanguage, which makes the statement about truth, from the object language, which contains the sentence whose truth is being asserted, and gave a correspondence (the T-schema) between phrases in the object language and elements of an interpretation.  Tarski's approach to the difficult idea of explaining truth has been enduringly influential in logic and philosophy, especially in the development of model theory.Feferman and Feferman 2004, p. 122, discussing \"The Impact of Tarski's Theory of Truth\".  Tarski also produced important work on the methodology of deductive systems, and on fundamental principles such as completeness, decidability, consistency and definability. According to Anita Feferman, Tarski \"changed the face of logic in the twentieth century\".Feferman 1999, p. 1\n\nAlonzo Church and Alan Turing proposed formal models of computability, giving independent negative solutions to Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem in 1936 and 1937, respectively. The Entscheidungsproblem asked for a procedure that, given any formal mathematical statement, would algorithmically determine whether the statement is true.  Church and Turing proved there is no such procedure; Turing's paper introduced the halting problem as a key example of a mathematical problem without an algorithmic solution.\n\nChurch's system for computation developed into the modern λ-calculus, while the Turing machine became a standard model for a general-purpose computing device. It was soon shown that many other proposed models of computation were equivalent in power to those proposed by Church and Turing. These results led to the Church–Turing thesis that any deterministic algorithm that can be carried out by a human can be carried out by a Turing machine. Church proved additional undecidability results, showing that both Peano arithmetic and first-order logic are undecidable. Later work by Emil Post and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1940s extended the scope of computability theory and introduced the concept of degrees of unsolvability.\n\nThe results of the first few decades of the twentieth century also had an impact upon analytic philosophy and philosophical logic, particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as modal logic, temporal logic, deontic logic, and relevance logic.\n\nLogic after WWII\nalt=Man with a beard and straw hat on a beach|thumb|Saul Kripke\n\nAfter World War II, mathematical logic branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: model theory, proof theory, computability theory, and set theory.See e.g. Barwise, Handbook of Mathematical Logic\n\nIn set theory, the method of forcing revolutionized the field by providing a robust method for constructing models and obtaining independence results.  Paul Cohen introduced this method in 1963 to prove the independence of the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis, II  Paul J. Cohen Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 51, No. 1. (Jan. 15, 1964), pp. 105-110. His technique, which was simplified and extended soon after its introduction, has since been applied to many other problems in all areas of mathematical logic.\n\nComputability theory had its roots in the work of Turing, Church, Kleene, and Post in the 1930s and 40s. It developed into a study of abstract computability, which became known as recursion theory.Many of the foundational papers are collected in The Undecidable (1965) edited by Martin Davis  The priority method, discovered independently by Albert Muchnik and Richard Friedberg in the 1950s, led to major advances in the understanding of the degrees of unsolvability and related structures.   Research into higher-order computability theory demonstrated its connections to set theory.   The fields of constructive analysis and computable analysis were developed to study the effective content of classical mathematical theorems; these in turn inspired the program of reverse mathematics.  A separate branch of computability theory, computational complexity theory, was also characterized in logical terms as a result of investigations into descriptive complexity.\n\nModel theory applies the methods of mathematical logic to study models of particular mathematical theories. Alfred Tarski published much pioneering work in the field, which is named after a series of papers he published under the title Contributions to the theory of models.  In the 1960s, Abraham Robinson used model-theoretic techniques to develop calculus and analysis based on infinitesimals, a problem that first had been proposed by Leibniz. \n\nIn proof theory, the relationship between classical mathematics and intuitionistic mathematics was clarified via tools such as the realizability method invented by Georg Kreisel and Gödel's Dialectica interpretation. This work inspired the contemporary area of proof mining. The Curry-Howard correspondence emerged as a deep analogy between logic and computation, including a correspondence between systems of natural deduction and typed lambda calculi used in computer science.  As a result, research into this class of formal systems began to address both logical and computational aspects; this area of research came to be known as modern type theory.  Advances were also made in ordinal analysis and the study of independence results in arithmetic such as the Paris–Harrington theorem.\n\nThis was also a period, particularly in the 1950s and afterwards, when the ideas of mathematical logic begin to influence philosophical thinking.  For example, tense logic is a formalised system for representing, and reasoning about, propositions qualified in terms of time. The philosopher Arthur Prior played a significant role in its development in the 1960s. Modal logics extend the scope of formal logic to include the elements of modality (for example, possibility and necessity). The ideas of Saul Kripke, particularly about possible worlds, and the formal system now called Kripke semantics have had a profound impact on analytic philosophy.Jerry Fodor, \"Water's water everywhere\", London Review of Books, 21 October 2004 His best known and most influential work is Naming and Necessity (1980).See Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century: Volume 2: The Age of Meaning, Scott Soames: \"Naming and Necessity is among the most important works ever, ranking with the classical work of Frege in the late nineteenth century, and of Russell, Tarski and Wittgenstein in the first half of the twentieth century\". Cited in Byrne, Alex and Hall, Ned. 2004. 'Necessary Truths'. Boston Review October/November 2004 Deontic logics are closely related to modal logics: they attempt to capture the logical features of obligation, permission and related concepts. Although some basic novelties syncretizing mathematical and philosophical logic were shown by Bolzano in the early 1800s, it was Ernst Mally, a pupil of Alexius Meinong, who was to propose the first formal deontic system in his Grundgesetze des Sollens, based on the syntax of Whitehead's and Russell's propositional calculus.\n\nAnother logical system founded after World War II was fuzzy logic by Azerbaijani mathematician Lotfi Asker Zadeh in 1965.\n\nSee also\n\n History of deductive reasoning\n History of inductive reasoning\n History of the function concept\n History of Mathematics\n History of Philosophy\n Plato's beard\n Timeline of mathematical logic\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n Primary Sources\n Alexander of Aphrodisias, In Aristotelis An.

      "text": "In the field of differential equations, an initial value problem (also called a Cauchy problem by some authors) is an ordinary differential equation together with a specified value, called the initial condition, of the unknown function at a given point in the domain of the solution.  In physics or other sciences, modeling a system frequently amounts to solving an initial value problem; in this context, the differential initial value is an equation that is an evolution equation specifying how, given initial conditions, the system will evolve with time.\n\n Definition \nAn initial value problem is a differential equation\n  with   where  is an open set of ,\ntogether with a point in the domain of \n,\ncalled the initial condition.\n\nA solution to an initial value problem is a function  that is a solution to the differential equation and satisfies\n.\n\nIn higher dimensions, the differential equation is replaced with a family of equations , and  is viewed as the vector , most commonly associated with the position in space. More generally, the unknown function  can take values on infinite dimensional spaces, such as Banach spaces or spaces of distributions.\n\nInitial value problems are extended to higher orders by treating the derivatives in the same way as an independent function, e.g. .\n\n Existence and uniqueness of solutions \nFor a large class of initial value problems, the existence and uniqueness of a solution can be illustrated through the use of a calculator.\n\nThe Picard–Lindelöf theorem guarantees a unique solution on some interval containing t0 if ƒ is continuous on a region containing t0 and y0 and satisfies the Lipschitz condition on the variable y.\nThe proof of this theorem proceeds by reformulating the problem as an equivalent integral equation. The integral can be considered an operator which maps one function into another, such that the solution is a fixed point of the operator. The Banach fixed point theorem is then invoked to show that there exists a unique fixed point, which is the solution of the initial value problem.\n\nAn older proof of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem constructs a sequence of functions which converge to the solution of the integral equation, and thus, the solution of the initial value problem. Such a construction is sometimes called \"Picard's method\" or \"the method of successive approximations\". This version is essentially a special case of the Banach fixed point theorem.\n\nHiroshi Okamura obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of an initial value problem to be unique.  This condition has to do with the existence of a Lyapunov function for the system.\n\nIn some situations, the function ƒ is not of class C1, or even Lipschitz, so the usual result guaranteeing the local existence of a unique solution does not apply. The Peano existence theorem however proves that even for ƒ merely continuous, solutions are guaranteed to exist locally in time; the problem is that there is no guarantee of uniqueness. The result may be found in Coddington & Levinson (1955, Theorem 1.3) or Robinson (2001, Theorem 2.6). An even more general result is the Carathéodory existence theorem, which proves existence for some discontinuous functions ƒ.\n\nExamples\nA simple example is to solve  and .

      "text": "thumb|upright=1.2|The first four iterations of the Koch snowflake\nthumb|upright=1.35|The first seven iterations in animation\nthumb|Zooming into the Koch curve\n\nThe Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractals to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled \"On a Continuous Curve Without Tangents, Constructible from Elementary Geometry\" by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.\n\nAs the fractal evolves, the area of the snowflake converges to  the area of the original triangle, while the perimeter of the snowflake diverges to infinity. Consequently, the snowflake has a finite area bounded by an infinitely long line.\n\nConstruction\nThe Koch snowflake can be constructed by starting with an equilateral triangle, then recursively altering each line segment as follows:\n divide the line segment into three segments of equal length.\n draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment from step 1 as its base and points outward.\n remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle from step 2.\n\nThe first iteration of this process produces the outline of a hexagram.\n\nThe Koch snowflake is the limit approached as the above steps are followed indefinitely. The Koch curve originally described by Helge von Koch is constructed using only one of the three sides of the original triangle. In other words, three Koch curves make a Koch snowflake.\n\nA Koch curve–based representation of a nominally flat surface can similarly be created by repeatedly segmenting each line in a sawtooth pattern of segments with a given angle. — Study of fractal surfaces using Koch curves. \nthumb|A fractal rough surface built from multiple Koch curve iterations\n\nProperties\n\nPerimeter of the Koch snowflake\n\nEach iteration multiplies the number of sides in the Koch snowflake by four, so the number of sides after  iterations is given by:\n\nIf the original equilateral triangle has sides of length , the length of each side of the snowflake after  iterations is:\n\nThe perimeter of the snowflake after  iterations is:\n\nThe Koch curve has an infinite length, because the total length of the curve increases by a factor of  with each iteration. Each iteration creates four times as many line segments as in the previous iteration, with the length of each one being  the length of the segments in the previous stage. Hence, the length of the curve after  iterations will be () times the original triangle perimeter and is unbounded, as  tends to infinity.\n\nLimit of perimeter\n\nAs the number of iterations tends to infinity, the limit of the perimeter is:\n\nsince || > 1. \n\nAn -dimensional measure exists, but has not been calculated so far. Only upper and lower bounds have been invented.\n\nArea of the Koch snowflake\n\nIn each iteration a new triangle is added on each side of the previous iteration, so the number of new triangles added in iteration  is:\n\nThe area of each new triangle added in an iteration is  of the area of each triangle added in the previous iteration, so the area of each triangle added in iteration  is:\n\nwhere  is the area of the original triangle. The total new area added in iteration  is therefore:\n\nThe total area of the snowflake after  iterations is:\n\nCollapsing the geometric sum gives:\n\nLimits of area\n\nThe limit of the area is:\n\nsince || < 1.\n\nThus, the area of the Koch snowflake is  of the area of the original triangle. Expressed in terms of the side length  of the original triangle, this is: \n\nOther properties\nThe Koch snowflake is self-replicating  with six smaller copies surrounding one larger copy at the center. Hence, it is an irrep-7 irrep-tile (see Rep-tile for discussion).\n\nThe fractal dimension of the Koch curve is  ≈ 1.26186. This is greater than that of a line (=1) but less than that of Peano's space-filling curve (=2).\n\nThe Koch curve is continuous everywhere, but differentiable nowhere.\n\nTessellation of the plane\nthumb|Tessellation by two sizes of Koch snowflake\nIt is possible to tessellate the plane by copies of Koch snowflakes in two different sizes. However, such a tessellation is not possible using only snowflakes of one size. Since each Koch snowflake in the tessellation can be subdivided into seven smaller snowflakes of two different sizes, it is also possible to find tessellations that use more than two sizes at once.. Koch snowflakes and Koch antisnowflakes of the same size may be used to tile the plane.\n\n Thue–Morse sequence and turtle graphics \nA turtle graphic is the curve that is generated if an automaton is programmed with a sequence.\nIf the Thue–Morse sequence members are used in order to select program states:\n\n If , move ahead by one unit,\n If , rotate counterclockwise by an angle of ,\n\nthe resulting curve converges to the Koch snowflake.\n\nRepresentation as Lindenmayer system\nThe Koch curve can be expressed by the following rewrite system (Lindenmayer system):\n\nAlphabet :   F\nConstants :   +, −\nAxiom :   F\nProduction rules:\n       F → F+F--F+F\n\nHere, F means \"draw forward\", - means \"turn right 60°\", and + means \"turn left 60°\".\n\nTo create the Koch snowflake, one would use F--F--F (an equilateral triangle) as the axiom.\n\n Variants of the Koch curve \nFollowing von Koch's concept, several variants of the Koch curve were designed, considering right angles (quadratic), other angles (Cesàro), circles and polyhedra and their extensions to higher dimensions (Sphereflake and Kochcube, respectively)\n\n Variant  Illustration  Construction 1D, 85° angle  thumb|150px|Cesàro fractal The Cesàro fractal is a variant of the Koch curve with an angle between 60° and 90° (here 85°). 1D, 90° angle  thumb|150px|Quadratic type 1 curve thumb|450px| First two iterations 1D, 90° angle  thumb|150px|Quadratic type 2 curve Minkowski Sausage thumb|450px| First two iterations.

The shape can be considered a three-dimensional extension of the curve in the same sense that the Sierpiński pyramid and Menger sponge can be considered extensions of the Sierpinski triangle and Sierpinski carpet. The version of the curve used for this shape uses 85° angles.\n\nSquares can be used to generate similar fractal curves. Starting with a unit square and adding to each side at each iteration a square with dimension one third of the squares in the previous iteration, it can be shown that both the length of the perimeter and the total area are determined by geometric progressions. The progression for the area converges to 2 while the progression for the perimeter diverges to infinity, so as in the case of the Koch snowflake, we have a finite area bounded by an infinite fractal curve.Demonstrated by  James McDonald  in a public lecture at KAUST University on January 27, 2013.  retrieved 29 January 2013.

      "text": "In measure theory, the Lebesgue measure, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space. For n = 1, 2, or 3, it coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume. In general, it is also called n-dimensional volume, n''-volume, or simply volume.The term volume is also used, more strictly, as a synonym of 3-dimensional volume It is used throughout real analysis, in particular to define Lebesgue integration. Sets that can be assigned a Lebesgue measure are called Lebesgue-measurable; the measure of the Lebesgue-measurable set A is here denoted by λ(A).\n\nHenri Lebesgue described this measure in the year 1901, followed the next year by his description of the Lebesgue integral. Both were published as part of his dissertation in 1902.\n\nThe Lebesgue measure is often denoted by dx, but this should not be confused with the distinct notion of a volume form.\n\n  Definition \n\nGiven a subset , with the length of interval  given by , the Lebesgue outer measure   is defined as\n\n.\n\nThe Lebesgue measure is defined on the Lebesgue σ-algebra, which is the collection of all sets  which satisfy the \"Carathéodory criterion\" which requires that for every ,\n\nFor any set in the Lebesgue σ-algebra, its Lebesgue measure is given by its Lebesgue outer measure .\n\nSets that are not included in the Lebesgue σ-algebra are not Lebesgue-measurable. Such sets do exist, i.e., the Lebesgue σ-algebra is strictly contained in the power set of .\n\n Intuition \n\nThe first part of the definition states that the subset  of the real numbers is reduced to its outer measure by coverage by sets of open intervals.  Each of these sets of intervals  covers  in the sense that when the intervals are combined together by union, they contain . The total length of any covering interval set can easily overestimate the measure of , because  is a subset of the union of the intervals, and so the intervals may include points which are not in . The Lebesgue outer measure emerges as the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the lengths from among all possible such sets. Intuitively, it is the total length of those interval sets which fit  most tightly and do not overlap.\n\nThat characterizes the Lebesgue outer measure. Whether this outer measure translates to the Lebesgue measure proper depends on an additional condition. This condition is tested by taking subsets  of the real numbers using  as an instrument to split  into two partitions: the part of  which intersects with  and the remaining part of  which is not in : the set difference of  and .  These partitions of  are subject to the outer measure. If for all possible such subsets  of the real numbers, the partitions of  cut apart by  have outer measures whose sum is the outer measure of , then the outer Lebesgue measure of  gives its Lebesgue measure. Intuitively, this condition means that the set  must not have some curious properties which causes a discrepancy in the measure of another set when  is used as a \"mask\" to \"clip\" that set, hinting at the existence of sets for which the Lebesgue outer measure does not give the Lebesgue measure. (Such sets are, in fact, not Lebesgue-measurable.)\n\n Examples \n\n Any open or closed interval  of real numbers is Lebesgue-measurable, and its Lebesgue measure is the length . The open interval  has the same measure, since the difference between the two sets consists only of the end points a and b and has measure zero.\n Any Cartesian product of intervals  and  is Lebesgue-measurable, and its Lebesgue measure is , the area of the corresponding rectangle.\n Moreover, every Borel set is Lebesgue-measurable. However, there are Lebesgue-measurable sets which are not Borel sets.\n Any countable set of real numbers has Lebesgue measure 0.\n In particular, the Lebesgue measure of the set of rational numbers is 0, although the set is dense in R.\n The Cantor set is an example of an uncountable set that has Lebesgue measure zero.\n If the axiom of determinacy holds then all sets of reals are Lebesgue-measurable. Determinacy is however not compatible with the axiom of choice.\n Vitali sets are examples of sets that are not measurable with respect to the Lebesgue measure.  Their existence relies on the axiom of choice.\n Osgood curves are simple plane curves with positive Lebesgue measure (it can be obtained by small variation of the Peano curve construction). The dragon curve is another unusual example.\n Any line in , for , has a zero Lebesgue measure. In general, every proper hyperplane has a zero Lebesgue measure in its ambient space.\n\n Properties \nthumb|300px|Translation invariance: The Lebesgue measure of  and  are the same.\nThe Lebesgue measure on Rn has the following properties:\n\n If A is a cartesian product of intervals I1 × I2 × ... × In, then A is Lebesgue-measurable and  Here, |I| denotes the length of the interval I.\n If A is a disjoint union of countably many disjoint Lebesgue-measurable sets, then A is itself Lebesgue-measurable and λ(A) is equal to the sum (or infinite series) of the measures of the involved measurable sets.\n If A is Lebesgue-measurable, then so is its complement.\n λ(A) ≥ 0 for every Lebesgue-measurable set A.\n If A and B are Lebesgue-measurable and A is a subset of B, then λ(A) ≤ λ(B). (A consequence of 2, 3 and 4.)\n Countable unions and intersections of Lebesgue-measurable sets are Lebesgue-measurable. (Not a consequence of 2 and 3, because a family of sets that is closed under complements and disjoint countable unions need not be closed under countable unions: .)\n If A is an open or closed subset of Rn (or even Borel set, see metric space), then A is Lebesgue-measurable.\n If A is a Lebesgue-measurable set, then it is \"approximately open\" and \"approximately closed\" in the sense of Lebesgue measure (see the regularity theorem for Lebesgue measure). \n A Lebesgue-measurable set can be \"squeezed\" between a containing open set and a contained closed set.  This property has been used as an alternative definition of Lebesgue measurability.  More precisely,  is Lebesgue-measurable if and only if for every  there exist an open set  and a closed set  such that  and .\n A Lebesgue-measurable set can be \"squeezed\" between a containing Gδset and a contained Fσ. I.e, if A is Lebesgue-measurable then there exist a Gδset G and an Fσ F such that G ⊇ A ⊇ F and λ(G \\ A) = λ(A \\ F) = 0.\n Lebesgue measure is both locally finite and inner regular, and so it is a Radon measure.\n Lebesgue measure is strictly positive on non-empty open sets, and so its support is the whole of Rn.\n If A is a Lebesgue-measurable set with λ(A) = 0 (a null set), then every subset of A is also a null set. A fortiori, every subset of A is measurable.\n If A is Lebesgue-measurable and x is an element of Rn, then the translation of A by x, defined by A + x = {a + x : a ∈ A}, is also Lebesgue-measurable and has the same measure as A.\n If A is Lebesgue-measurable and , then the dilation of  by  defined by  is also Lebesgue-measurable and has measure \n More generally, if T is a linear transformation and A is a measurable subset of Rn, then T(A) is also Lebesgue-measurable and has the measure .\n\nAll the above may be succinctly summarized as follows:\n\n The Lebesgue-measurable sets form a σ-algebra containing all products of intervals, and λ is the unique complete translation-invariant measure on that σ-algebra with \n\nThe Lebesgue measure also has the property of being σ-finite.\n\n Null sets \n\nA subset of Rn is a null set if, for every ε > 0, it can be covered with countably many products of n intervals whose total volume is at most ε. All countable sets are null sets.\n\nIf a subset of Rn has Hausdorff dimension less than n then it is a null set with respect to n-dimensional Lebesgue measure.  Here Hausdorff dimension is relative to the Euclidean metric on Rn (or any metric Lipschitz equivalent to it). On the other hand, a set may have topological dimension less than n and have positive n-dimensional Lebesgue measure.  An example of this is the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set which has topological dimension 0 yet has positive 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure.\n\nIn order to show that a given set A is Lebesgue-measurable, one usually tries to find a \"nicer\" set B which differs from A only by a null set (in the sense that the symmetric difference (A − B) (B − A) is a null set) and then show that B can be generated using countable unions and intersections from open or closed sets.\n\n Construction of the Lebesgue measure \nThe modern construction of the Lebesgue measure is an application of Carathéodory's extension theorem. It proceeds as follows.\n\nFix . A box in Rn is a set of the form\n\nwhere , and the product symbol here represents a Cartesian product. The volume of this box is defined to be\n\nFor any subset A of Rn, we can define its outer measure λ*(A) by:\n\nWe then define the set A to be Lebesgue-measurable if for every subset S of Rn,\n\nThese Lebesgue-measurable sets form a σ-algebra, and the Lebesgue measure is defined by  for any Lebesgue-measurable set A.\n\nThe existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable is a consequence of a certain set-theoretical axiom, the axiom of choice, which is independent from many of the conventional systems of axioms for set theory.  The Vitali theorem, which follows from the axiom, states that there exist subsets of R that are not Lebesgue-measurable.  Assuming the axiom of choice, non-measurable sets with many surprising properties have been demonstrated, such as those of the Banach–Tarski paradox.\n\nIn 1970, Robert M. Solovay showed that the existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable is not provable within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory in the absence of the axiom of choice (see Solovay's model).\n\n Relation to other measures \nThe Borel measure agrees with the Lebesgue measure on those sets for which it is defined; however, there are many more Lebesgue-measurable sets than there are Borel measurable sets. The Borel measure is translation-invariant, but not complete.\n\nThe Haar measure can be defined on any locally compact group and is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure (Rn with addition is a locally compact group).\n\nThe Hausdorff measure is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure that is useful for measuring the subsets of Rn of lower dimensions than n, like submanifolds, for example, surfaces or curves in R3 and fractal sets. The Hausdorff measure is not to be confused with the notion of Hausdorff dimension.\n\nIt can be shown that there is no infinite-dimensional analogue of Lebesgue measure.\n\n See also \n Lebesgue's density theorem\nLebesgue measure of the set of Liouville numbers\n\n References \n\nCategory:Measures (measure theory)"

The blue line is the common solution of a pair of linear equations. \n\nLinear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as \n\nlinear functions such as\n\nand their representations through matrices and vector spaces.\n\nLinear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry, including for defining basic objects such as lines, planes and rotations. Also, functional analysis may be basically viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions. Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and engineering areas, because it allows modeling many natural phenomena, and efficiently computing with such models. For nonlinear systems, which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, linear algebra is often used as a first-order approximation.\n\nHistory\nThe procedure for solving simultaneous linear equations now called Gaussian elimination appears in the ancient Chinese mathematical text Chapter Eight: Rectangular Arrays of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. Its use is illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations. \n\nSystems of linear equations arose in Europe with the introduction in 1637 by René Descartes of coordinates in geometry. In fact, in this new geometry, now called Cartesian geometry, lines and planes are represented by linear equations, and computing their intersections amounts to solving systems of linear equations.\n\nThe first systematic methods for solving linear systems used determinants, first considered by Leibniz in 1693. In 1750, Gabriel Cramer used them for giving explicit solutions of linear systems, now called Cramer's rule. Later, Gauss further described the method of elimination, which was initially listed as an advancement in geodesy.\n\nIn 1844 Hermann Grassmann published his \"Theory of Extension\" which included foundational new topics of what is today called linear algebra. In 1848, James Joseph Sylvester introduced the term matrix, which is Latin for womb. \n\nLinear algebra grew with ideas noted in the complex plane. For instance, two numbers w and z in ℂ have a difference w – z, and the line segments  are of the same length and direction. The segments are equipollent. The four-dimensional system ℍ of quaternions was started in 1843. The term vector was introduced as v = x i + y j + z k representing a point in space. The quaternion difference p – q also produces a segment equipollent to   \nOther hypercomplex number systems also used the idea of a linear space with a basis.\n\nArthur Cayley introduced matrix multiplication  and the inverse matrix in 1856, making possible the general linear group. The mechanism of group representation became available for describing complex and hypercomplex numbers. Crucially, Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix, thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object. He also realized the connection between matrices and determinants, and wrote \"There would be many things to say about this theory of matrices which should, it seems to me, precede the theory of determinants\".\n\nBenjamin Peirce published his Linear Associative Algebra (1872), and his son Charles Sanders Peirce extended the work later.Benjamin Peirce (1872) Linear Associative Algebra, lithograph, new edition with corrections, notes, and an added 1875 paper by Peirce, plus notes by his son Charles Sanders Peirce, published in the American Journal of Mathematics v. 4, 1881, Johns Hopkins University, pp. 221–226, Google Eprint and as an extract, D. Van Nostrand, 1882, Google Eprint.\n\nThe telegraph required an explanatory system, and the 1873 publication of A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism instituted a field theory of forces and required differential geometry for expression. Linear algebra is flat differential geometry and serves in tangent spaces to manifolds. Electromagnetic symmetries of spacetime are expressed by the Lorentz transformations, and much of the history of linear algebra is the history of Lorentz transformations.\n\nThe first modern and more precise definition of a vector space was introduced by Peano in 1888; by 1900, a theory of linear transformations of finite-dimensional vector spaces had emerged. Linear algebra took its modern form in the first half of the twentieth century, when many ideas and methods of previous centuries were generalized as abstract algebra. The development of computers led to increased research in efficient algorithms for Gaussian elimination and matrix decompositions, and linear algebra became an essential tool for modelling and simulations.\n\nSee also  and .\n\nVector spaces\n\nUntil the 19th century, linear algebra was introduced through systems of linear equations and matrices. In modern mathematics, the presentation through vector spaces is generally preferred, since it is more synthetic, more general (not limited to the finite-dimensional case), and conceptually simpler, although more abstract.\n\nA vector space over a field  (often the field of the real numbers) is a set  equipped with two binary operations satisfying the following axioms.  \nElements of  are called vectors, and elements of F are called scalars. The first operation, vector addition, takes any two vectors  and  and outputs a third vector . The second operation, scalar multiplication, takes any scalar  and any vector  and outputs a new . The axioms that addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy are the following. (In the list below,  and  are arbitrary elements of , and  and  are arbitrary scalars in the field .)\n\n Axiom Signification Associativity of addition   Commutativity of addition   Identity element of addition  There exists an element  in , called the zero vector (or simply zero), such that  for all  in . Inverse elements of addition  For every  in , there exists an element  in , called the additive inverse of , such that  Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition    Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition   Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication   This axiom is not asserting the associativity of an operation, since there are two operations in question, scalar multiplication: bv; and field multiplication: ab. Identity element of scalar multiplication  , where  denotes the multiplicative identity of .\n\nThe first four axioms mean that  is an abelian group under addition.\n\nElements of a vector space may have various nature; for example, they can be sequences, functions, polynomials or matrices. Linear algebra is concerned with properties common to all vector spaces.\n\nLinear maps\n\nLinear maps are mappings between vector spaces that preserve the vector-space structure. Given two vector spaces  and  over a field , a linear map (also called, in some contexts, linear transformation, linear mapping or linear operator) is a map\n\n \n\nthat is compatible with addition and scalar multiplication, that is\n\n \n\nfor any vectors  in  and scalar  in .\n\nThis implies that for any vectors  in  and scalars  in , one has\n\n \n\nWhen a bijective linear map exists between two vector spaces (that is, every vector from the second space is associated with exactly one in the first), the two spaces are isomorphic. Because an isomorphism preserves linear structure, two isomorphic vector spaces are \"essentially the same\" from the linear algebra point of view, in the sense that they cannot be distinguished by using vector space properties. An essential question in linear algebra is testing whether a linear map is an isomorphism or not, and, if it is not an isomorphism, finding its range (or image) and the set of elements that are mapped to the zero vector, called the kernel of the map. All these questions can be solved by using Gaussian elimination or some variant of this algorithm.\n\nSubspaces, span, and basis\n\nThe study of subsets of vector spaces that are themselves vector spaces for the induced operations is fundamental, similarly as for many mathematical structures. These subsets are called linear subspaces. More precisely, a linear subspace of a vector space  over a field  is a subset  of  such that  and  are in , for every ,  in , and every  in . (These conditions suffices for implying that  is a vector space.)\n\nFor example, the image of a linear map, and the inverse image of 0 by a linear map (called kernel or null space) are linear subspaces.\n\nAnother important way of forming a subspace is to consider linear combinations of a set  of vectors: the set of all sums \n \nwhere  are in , and  are in  form a linear subspace called the span of . The span of  is also the intersection of all linear subspaces containing . In other words, it is the (smallest for the inclusion relation) linear subspace containing .\n\nA set of vectors is linearly independent if none is in the span of the others. Equivalently, a set  of vector is linearly independent if the only way to express the zero vector as a linear combination of elements of  is to take zero for every coefficient \n\nA set of vectors that spans a vector space is called a spanning set or generating set. If a spanning set  is linearly dependent (that is not linearly independent), then some element  of  is in the span of the other elements of , and the span would remain the same if one remove  from . One may continue to remove elements of  until getting a linearly independent spanning set. Such a linearly independent set that spans a vector space  is called a basis of . The importance of bases lies in the fact that there are together minimal generating sets and maximal independent sets. More precisely, if  is a linearly independent set, and  is a spanning set such that  then there is a basis  such that \n\nAny two bases of a vector space  have the same cardinality, which is called the dimension of ; this is the dimension theorem for vector spaces. Moreover, two vector spaces over the same field  are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.Axler (2004), p. 55\n\nIf any basis of  (and therefore every basis) has a finite number of elements,  is a finite-dimensional vector space. If  is a subspace of , then . In the case where  is finite-dimensional, the equality of the dimensions implies .\n\nIf U1 and U2 are subspaces of V, then\n\nwhere denotes the span of Axler (2204), p. 33\n\nMatrices\n\nMatrices allow explicit manipulation of finite-dimensional vector spaces and linear maps. Their theory is thus an essential part of linear algebra.\n\nLet  be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field , and  be a basis of  (thus  is the dimension of ). By definition of a basis, the map\n\nis a bijection from  the set of the sequences of  elements of , onto . This is an isomorphism of vector spaces, if  is equipped of its standard structure of vector space, where vector addition and scalar multiplication are done component by component.\n\nThis isomorphism allows representing a vector by its inverse image under this isomorphism, that is by the coordinates vector  or by the column matrix\n\nIf  is another finite dimensional vector space (possibly the same), with a basis  a linear map  from  to  is well defined by its values on the basis elements, that is  Thus,  is well represented by the list of the corresponding column matrices. That is, if \n \nfor , then  is represented by the matrix\n\nwith  rows and  columns.\n\nMatrix multiplication is defined in such a way that the product of two matrices is the matrix of the composition of the corresponding linear maps, and the product of a matrix and a column matrix is the column matrix representing the result of applying the represented linear map to the represented vector. It follows that the theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces and the theory of matrices are two different languages for expressing exactly the same concepts.\n\nTwo matrices that encode the same linear transformation in different bases are called similar. Equivalently, two matrices are similar if one can transform one in the other by elementary row and column operations. For a matrix representing a linear map from  to , the row operations correspond to change of bases in  and the column operations correspond to change of bases in . Every matrix is similar to an identity matrix possibly bordered by zero rows and zero columns. In terms of vector space, this means that, for any linear map from  to , there are bases such that a part of the basis of  is mapped bijectively on a part of the basis of , and that the remaining basis elements of , if any, are mapped to zero (this is a way of expressing the fundamental theorem of linear algebra). Gaussian elimination is the basic algorithm for finding these elementary operations, and proving this theorem.\n\nLinear systems\n\nSystems of linear equations form a fundamental part of linear algebra. Historically, linear algebra and matrix theory has been developed for solving such systems. In the modern presentation of linear algebra through vector spaces and matrices, many problems may be interpreted in terms of linear systems.\n\nFor example, let\n\nbe a linear system.\n\nTo such a system, one may associate its matrix \n\nand its right member vector\n\nLet  be the linear transformation associated to the matrix . A solution of the system  is a vector \n \nsuch that \n\nthat is an element of the preimage of  by .\n\nLet  be the associated homogeneous system, where the right-hand sides of the equations are put to zero. The solutions of  are exactly the elements of the kernel of  or, equivalently, .\n\nThe Gaussian-elimination consists of performing elementary row operations on the augmented matrix\n\nfor putting it in reduced row echelon form. These row operations do not change the set of solutions of the system of equations. In the example, the reduced echelon form is \n\nshowing that the system  has the unique solution\n\nIt follows from this matrix interpretation of linear systems that the same methods can be applied for solving linear systems and for many operations on matrices and linear transformations, which include the computation of the ranks, kernels, matrix inverses.\n\nEndomorphisms and square matrices\n\nA linear endomorphism is a linear map that maps a vector space  to itself. \nIf  has a basis of  elements, such an endomorphism is represented by a square matrix of size .\n\nWith respect to general linear maps, linear endomorphisms and square matrices have some specific properties that make their study an important part of linear algebra, which is used in many parts of mathematics, including geometric transformations, coordinate changes, quadratic forms, and many other part of mathematics.\n\nDeterminant\n\nThe determinant of a square matrix is a polynomial function of the entries of the matrix, such that the matrix is invertible if and only if the determinant is not zero. This results from the fact that the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of the determinants, and thus that a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is invertible.\n\nCramer's rule is a closed-form expression, in terms of determinants, of the solution of a system of  linear equations in  unknowns. Cramer's rule is useful for reasoning about the solution, but, except for  or , it is rarely used for computing a solution, since Gaussian elimination is a faster algorithm.\n\nThe determinant of an endomorphism is the determinant of the matrix representing the endomorphism in terms of some ordered basis. This definition makes sense, since this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis.\n\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors\n\nIf  is a linear endomorphism of a vector space  over a field , an eigenvector of  is a nonzero vector  of  such that  for some scalar  in . This scalar  is an eigenvalue of .\n\nIf the dimension of  is finite, and a basis has been chosen,  and  may be represented, respectively, by a square matrix  and a column matrix ; the equation defining eigenvectors and eigenvalues becomes\n\nUsing the identity matrix , whose entries are all zero, except those of the main diagonal, which are equal to one, this may be rewritten\n\nAs  is supposed to be nonzero, this means that  is a singular matrix, and thus that its determinant  equals zero. The eigenvalues are thus the roots of the polynomial\n\nIf  is of dimension , this is a monic polynomial of degree , called the characteristic polynomial of the matrix (or of the endomorphism), and there are, at most,  eigenvalues.\n\nIf a basis exists that consists only of eigenvectors, the matrix of  on this basis has a very simple structure: it is a diagonal matrix such that the entries on the main diagonal are eigenvalues, and the other entries are zero. In this case, the endomorphism and the matrix are said diagonalizable. More generally, an endomorphism and a matrix are also said diagonalizable, if they become diagonalizable after extending the field of scalars. In this extended sense, if the characteristic polynomial is square-free, then the matrix is diagonalizable.\n\nA symmetric matrix is always diagonalizable. There are non-diagonalizable matrices, the simplest being\n\n(it cannot be diagonalizable since its square is the zero matrix, and the square of a nonzero diagonal matrix is never zero).\n\nWhen an endomorphism is not diagonalizable, there are bases on which it has a simple form, although not as simple as the diagonal form. The Frobenius normal form does not need of extending the field of scalars and makes the characteristic polynomial immediately readable on the matrix. The Jordan normal form requires to extend the field of scalar for containing all eigenvalues, and differs from the diagonal form only by some entries that are just above the main diagonal and are equal to 1.\n\nDuality\n\nA linear form is a linear map from a vector space  over a field  to the field of scalars , viewed as a vector space over itself. Equipped by pointwise addition and multiplication by a scalar, the linear forms form a vector space, called the dual space of , and usually denoted \n\nIf  is a basis of  (this implies that  is finite-dimensional), then one can define, for , a linear map  such that  and  if . These linear maps form a basis of  called the dual basis of  (If  is not finite-dimensional, the  may be defined similarly; they are linearly independent, but do not form a basis.)\n\nFor  in , the map\n\nis a linear form on  This defines the canonical linear map from  into  the dual of  called the bidual of . This canonical map is an isomorphism if  is finite-dimensional, and this allows identifying  with its bidual. (In the infinite dimensional case, the canonical map is injective, but not surjective.)\n\nThere is thus a complete symmetry between a finite-dimensional vector space and its dual. This motivates the frequent use, in this context, of the bra–ket notation\n\nfor denoting .\n\nDual map\n\nLet \n\nbe a linear map. For every linear form  on , the composite function  is a linear form on . This defines a linear map\n\nbetween the dual spaces, which is called the dual or the transpose of .\n\nIf  and  are finite dimensional, and  is the matrix of  in terms of some ordered bases, then the matrix of  over the dual bases is the transpose  of , obtained by exchanging rows and columns.\n\nIf elements of vector spaces and their duals are represented by column vectors, this duality may be expressed in bra–ket notation by \n\nFor highlighting this symmetry, the two members of this equality are sometimes written \n\nInner-product spaces\n\nBesides these basic concepts, linear algebra also studies vector spaces with additional structure, such as an inner product. The inner product is an example of a bilinear form, and it gives the vector space a geometric structure by allowing for the definition of length and angles. Formally, an inner product is a map\n\nthat satisfies the following three axioms for all vectors u, v, w in V and all scalars a in F:\n Conjugate symmetry:\n\nNote that in R, it is symmetric.\n Linearity in the first argument:\n\n Positive-definiteness:\n\n with equality only for v = 0.\n\nWe can define the length of a vector v in V by\n\nand we can prove the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality:\n\nIn particular, the quantity\n\nand so we can call this quantity the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.\n\nTwo vectors are orthogonal if . An orthonormal basis is a basis where all basis vectors have length 1 and are orthogonal to each other. Given any finite-dimensional vector space, an orthonormal basis could be found by the Gram–Schmidt procedure. Orthonormal bases are particularly easy to deal with, since if v = a1 v1 + ... + an vn, then .\n\nThe inner product facilitates the construction of many useful concepts. For instance, given a transform T, we can define its Hermitian conjugate T* as the linear transform satisfying\n\nIf T satisfies TT* = T*T, we call T normal. It turns out that normal matrices are precisely the matrices that have an orthonormal system of eigenvectors that span V.\n\nRelationship with geometry\nThere is a strong relationship between linear algebra and geometry, which started with the introduction by René Descartes, in 1637, of Cartesian coordinates. In this new (at that time) geometry, now called Cartesian geometry, points are represented by Cartesian coordinates, which are sequences of three real numbers (in the case of the usual three-dimensional space). The basic objects of geometry, which are lines and planes are represented by linear equations. Thus, computing intersections of lines and planes amounts solving systems of linear equations. This was one of the main motivations for developing linear algebra.\n\nMost geometric transformation, such as translations, rotations, reflections, rigid motions, isometries, and projections transform lines into lines. It follows that they can be defined, specified and studied in terms of linear maps. This is also the case of homographies and Möbius transformations, when considered as transformations of a projective space. \n\nUntil the end of 19th century, geometric spaces were defined by axioms relating points, lines and planes (synthetic geometry). Around this date, it appeared that one may also define geometric spaces by constructions involving vector spaces (see, for example, Projective space and Affine space) It has been shown that the two approaches are essentially equivalent.Emil Artin (1957) Geometric Algebra Interscience Publishers In classical geometry, the involved vector spaces are vector spaces over the reals, but the constructions may be extended to vector spaces over any field, allowing considering geometry over arbitrary fields, including finite fields. \n\nPresently, most textbooks, introduce geometric spaces from linear algebra, and geometry is often presented, at elementary level, as a subfield of linear algebra.\n\n Usage and applications \nLinear algebra is used in almost all areas of mathematics, thus making it relevant in almost all scientific domains that use mathematics. These applications may be divided into several wide categories.\n\n Geometry of our ambient space \nThe modeling of our ambient space is based on geometry. Sciences concerned with this space use geometry widely. This is the case with mechanics and robotics, for describing rigid body dynamics; geodesy for describing Earth shape; perspectivity, computer vision, and computer graphics, for describing the relationship between a scene and its plane representation; and many other scientific domains.\n\nIn all these applications, synthetic geometry is often used for general descriptions and a qualitative approach, but for the study of explicit situations, one must compute with coordinates. This requires the heavy use of linear algebra.\n\n Functional analysis \nFunctional analysis studies function spaces. These are vector spaces with additional structure, such as Hilbert spaces. Linear algebra is thus a fundamental part of functional analysis and its applications, which include, in particular, quantum mechanics (wave functions).\n\n Study of complex systems  \nMost physical phenomena are modeled by partial differential equations. To solve them, one usually decomposes the space in which the solutions are searched into small, mutually interacting cells. For linear systems this interaction involves linear functions. For nonlinear systems, this interaction is often approximated by linear functions.This may have the consequence that some physically interesting solutions are omitted. In both cases, very large matrices are generally involved. Weather forecasting is a typical example, where the whole Earth atmosphere is divided in cells of, say, 100 km of width and 100 m of height.\n\n Scientific computation \nNearly all scientific computations involve linear algebra. Consequently, linear algebra algorithms have been highly optimized. BLAS and LAPACK are the best known implementations. For improving efficiency, some of them configure the algorithms automatically, at run time, for adapting them to the specificities of the computer (cache size, number of available cores, ...).\n\nSome processors, typically graphics processing units (GPU), are designed with a matrix structure, for optimizing the operations of linear algebra.\n\nExtensions and generalizations\nThis section presents several related topics that do not appear generally in elementary textbooks on linear algebra, but are commonly considered, in advanced mathematics, as parts of linear algebra.\n\nModule theory\n\nThe existence of multiplicative inverses in fields is not involved in the axioms defining a vector space. One may thus replace the field of scalars by a ring , and this gives a structure called module over , or -module.\n\nThe concepts of linear independence, span, basis, and linear maps (also called module homomorphisms) are defined for modules exactly as for vector spaces, with the essential difference that, if  is not a field, there are modules that do not have any basis. The modules that have a basis are the free modules, and those that are spanned by a finite set are the finitely generated modules. Module homomorphisms between finitely generated free modules may be represented by matrices. The theory of matrices over a ring is similar to that of matrices over a field, except that determinants exist only if the ring is commutative, and that a square matrix over a commutative ring is invertible only if its determinant has a multiplicative inverse in the ring.\n\nVector spaces are completely characterized by their dimension (up to an isomorphism). In general, there is not such a complete classification for modules, even if one restricts oneself to finitely generated modules. However, every module is a cokernel of a homomorphism of free modules.\n\nModules over the integers can be identified with abelian groups, since the multiplication by an integer may identified to a repeated addition. Most of the theory of abelian groups may be extended to modules over a principal ideal domain. In particular, over a principal ideal domain, every submodule of a free module is free, and the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups may be extended straightforwardly to finitely generated modules over a principal ring.\n\nThere are many rings for which there are algorithms for solving linear equations and systems of linear equations. However, these algorithms have generally a computational complexity that is much higher than the similar algorithms over a field. For more details, see Linear equation over a ring.\n\nMultilinear algebra and tensors \n\nIn multilinear algebra, one considers multivariable linear transformations, that is, mappings that are linear in each of a number of different variables. This line of inquiry naturally leads to the idea of the dual space, the vector space V∗ consisting of linear maps  where F is the field of scalars. Multilinear maps  can be described via tensor products of elements of V∗.\n\nIf, in addition to vector addition and scalar multiplication, there is a bilinear vector product , the vector space is called an algebra; for instance, associative algebras are algebras with an associate vector product (like the algebra of square matrices, or the algebra of polynomials).\n\nTopological vector spaces\n\nVector spaces that are not finite dimensional often require additional structure to be tractable. A normed vector space is a vector space along with a function called a norm, which measures the \"size\" of elements. The norm induces a metric, which measures the distance between elements, and induces a topology, which allows for a definition of continuous maps. The metric also allows for a definition of limits and completeness - a metric space that is complete is known as a Banach space. A complete metric space along with the additional structure of an inner product (a conjugate symmetric sesquilinear form) is known as a Hilbert space, which is in some sense a particularly well-behaved Banach space. Functional analysis applies the methods of linear algebra alongside those of mathematical analysis to study various function spaces; the central objects of study in functional analysis are Lp spaces, which are Banach spaces, and especially the L2 space of square integrable functions, which is the only Hilbert space among them. Functional analysis is of particular importance to quantum mechanics, the theory of partial differential equations, digital signal processing, and electrical engineering. It also provides the foundation and theoretical framework that underlies the Fourier transform and related methods.\n\nHomological algebra\n\nSee also\n \n Linear equation over a ring\n Fundamental matrix in computer vision\n Linear regression, a statistical estimation method\n List of linear algebra topics\n Numerical linear algebra\n Linear programming\n Transformation matrix\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\nHistory\n Fearnley-Sander, Desmond, \"Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra\", American Mathematical Monthly 86 (1979), pp. 809–817.\n \n\nIntroductory textbooks\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Murty, Katta G.

      "text": "This is a list of articles about numbers. Due to the infinitude of many sets of numbers, this list will invariably be incomplete. Hence, only particularly notable numbers will be included. Numbers may be included in the list based on their mathematical, historical or cultural notability, but all numbers have qualities which could arguably make them notable. Even the least \"interesting\" number is paradoxically interesting for that very property. This is known as the interesting number paradox. \n\nThe definition of what is classed as a number is rather diffuse and based on historical distinctions. For example the pair of numbers (3,4) is commonly regarded as a number when it is in the form of a complex number (3+4i), but not when it is in the form of a vector (3,4). This list will also be categorised with the standard convention of types of numbers. \n\nThis list focuses on numbers as mathematical objects and is not a list of numerals, which are linguistic devices: nouns, adjectives, or adverbs that designate numbers. The distinction is drawn between the number five (an abstract object equal to 2+3),  and the numeral five (the noun referring to the number).\n\n Natural numbers \n\nThe natural numbers are a subset of the integers and are of historical and pedagogical value as they can be used for counting and often have ethno-cultural significance (see below). Beyond this, natural numbers are widely used as a building block for other number systems including the integers, rational numbers and real numbers. Natural numbers are those used for counting (as in \"there are six (6) coins on the table\") and ordering (as in \"this is the third (3rd) largest city in the country\").  In common language, words used for counting are \"cardinal numbers\" and words used for ordering are \"ordinal numbers\". Defined by the Peano axioms, the natural numbers form an infinitely large set.\n\nThe inclusion of 0 in the set of natural numbers is ambiguous and subject to individual definitions. In set theory and computer science, 0 is typically considered a natural number. In number theory, it usually is not. The ambiguity can be solved with the terms  \"non-negative integers\", which includes 0, and \"positive integers\", which does not.\n\nNatural numbers may be used as cardinal numbers, which may go by various names. Natural numbers may also be used as ordinal numbers.\n\nTable of small natural numbers.

As mathematical properties (such as divisibility) can confer practical utility, there may be interplay and connections between the cultural or practical significance of an integer and its mathematical properties.\n\n Classes of natural numbers \nSubsets of the natural numbers, such as the prime numbers, may be grouped into sets, for instance based on the divisibility of their members. Infinitely many such sets are possible. A list of notable classes of natural numbers may be found at classes of natural numbers.\n\n Prime numbers \n\nA prime number is a positive integer which has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself.\n\nThe first 100 prime numbers are:\n\nTable of first 100 prime numbers.

They are often used in geometry, grouping and time measurement.\n\nThe first 20 highly composite numbers are:\n\n1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, 7560.\n\n Perfect numbers \n\nA perfect number is an integer that is the sum of its positive proper divisors (all divisors except itself).\n\nThe first 10 perfect numbers:\n\n Integers \n\nThe integers are a set of numbers commonly encountered in arithmetic and number theory. There are many subsets of the integers, including the natural numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, etc. Many integers are notable for their mathematical properties. \n\nNotable integers include −1, the additive inverse of unity. and 0, the additive identity. \n\nAs with the natural numbers, the integers may also have cultural or practical significance. For instance, −40 is the equal point in the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. \n\n SI prefixes \nOne important use of integers is in Orders of magnitude (numbers). A power of ten is a number 10k, where k is an integer. For instance, with k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., the appropriate powers of ten are 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... Powers of ten can also be fractional: for instance, k = -3 gives 1/1000, or 0.001. This is used in scientific notation, real numbers are written in the form m × 10n. The number 394,000 is written in this form as 3.94 × 105.\n\nIntegers are used as prefixes in the SI system. A metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a multiple or fraction of the unit. Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. The prefix kilo-, for example, may be added to gram to indicate multiplication by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams. The prefix milli-, likewise, may be added to metre to indicate division by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre.\n\n Value  1000mSI prefix Name Binary prefix 10001 k Kilo Ki  10002 M Mega Mi  10003 G Giga Gi  10004 T Tera Ti  10005 P Peta Pi  10006 E Exa Ei  10007 Z Zetta Zi  10008 Y Yotta Yi \n\n Rational numbers \n\nA rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction  of two integers, a numerator  and a non-zero denominator . Since  may be equal to 1, every integer is trivially a rational number. The set of all rational numbers, often referred to as \"the rationals\",  the field of rationals or the field of rational numbers is usually denoted by a boldface  (or blackboard bold , Unicode ℚ); it was thus denoted in 1895 by Giuseppe Peano after quoziente, Italian for \"quotient\".\n\nRational numbers such as 0.12 can be represented in infinitely many ways, e.g. zero-point-one-two (0.12), three twenty-fifths (), nine seventy-fifths (), etc. This can be mitigated by representing rational numbers in a canonical form as an irreducible fraction.\n\nA list of rational numbers is shown below. The names of fractions can be found at numeral (linguistics). \n\n Table of notable rational numbers. Click to Decimal expansion  FractionNotability 1One is the multiplicative identity.

      "text": "In mathematical logic, Löb's theorem states that in Peano arithmetic (PA) (or any formal system including PA), for any formula P, if it is provable in PA that \"if P is provable in PA then P is true\", then P is provable in PA. More formally, if Prov(P) means that the formula P is provable, then\n\nor\n\nAn immediate corollary of Löb's theorem is that, if P is not provable in PA, then \"if P is provable in PA, then P is true\" is not provable in PA. For example, \"If  is provable in PA, then \" is not provable in PA.\n\nLöb's theorem is named for Martin Hugo Löb, who formulated it in 1955.\n\nLöb's theorem in provability logic\nProvability logic abstracts away from the details of encodings used in Gödel's incompleteness theorems by expressing the provability of  in the given system in the language of modal logic, by means of the modality .\n\nThen we can formalize Löb's theorem by the axiom\n\nknown as axiom GL, for Gödel-Löb. This is sometimes formalised by means of an inference rule that infers\n\nfrom\n\nThe provability logic GL that results from taking the modal logic K4 (or K, since the axiom schema 4, , then becomes redundant) and adding the above axiom GL is the most intensely investigated system in provability logic.\n\nModal proof of Löb's theorem\nLöb's theorem can be proved within modal logic using only some basic rules about the provability operator (the K4 system) plus the existence of modal fixed points.\n\nModal formulas\nWe will assume the following grammar for formulas:\n If  is a propositional variable, then  is a formula.\n If  is a propositional constant, then  is a formula.\n If  is a formula, then  is a formula.\n If  and  are formulas, then so are , , , , and \n\nA modal sentence is a modal formula that contains no propositional variables. We use  to mean  is a theorem.\n\nModal fixed points\nIf  is a modal formula with only one propositional variable , then a modal fixed point of  is a sentence  such that\n\nWe will assume the existence of such fixed points for every modal formula with one free variable. This is of course not an obvious thing to assume, but if we interpret  as provability in Peano Arithmetic, then the existence of modal fixed points is in fact true.\n\nModal rules of inference\nIn addition to the existence of modal fixed points, we assume the following rules of inference for the provability operator :\n\n (necessitation) From  conclude : Informally, this says that if A is a theorem, then it is provable.\n (internal necessitation) : If A is provable, then it is provable that it is provable.\n (box distributivity) :  This rule allows you to do modus ponens inside the provability operator. If it is provable that A implies B, and A is provable, then B is provable.\n\nProof of Löb's theorem\n\n Assume that there is a modal sentence  such that .Roughly speaking, it is a theorem that if  is provable, then it is, in fact true.This is a claim of soundness.\n From the existence of modal fixed points for every formula (in particular, the formula ) it follows there exists a sentence  such that .\n From 2, it follows that .\n From the necessitation rule, it follows that .\n From 4 and the box distributivity rule, it follows that .\n Applying the box distributivity rule with  and  gives us .\n From 5 and 6, it follows that .\n From the internal necessitation rule, it follows that .\n From 7 and 8, it follows that .\n From 1 and 9, it follows that .\n From 2, it follows that . \n From 10 and 11, it follows that \n From 12 and the necessitation rule, it follows that .\n From 13 and 10, it follows that .\n\nExamples\nAn immediate corollary of Löb's theorem is that, if P is not provable in PA, then \"if P is provable in PA, then P is true\" is not provable in PA. Given we know PA is consistent (but PA does not know PA is consistent), here are some simple examples:\n \"If  is provable in PA, then \" is not provable in PA, as  is not provable in PA (as it is false).\n \"If  is provable in PA, then \" is provable in PA, as is any statement of the form \"If X, then \".\n \"If the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is provable in PA, then the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true\" is not provable in PA, as \"The strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true\" is not provable in PA (despite being true).\n\nIn Doxastic logic, Löb's theorem shows that any system classified as a reflexive \"type 4\" reasoner must also be \"modest\": such a reasoner can never believe \"my belief in P would imply that P is true\", without first believing that P is true.Smullyan, Raymond M., (1986) Logicians who reason about themselves, Proceedings of the 1986 conference on Theoretical aspects of reasoning about knowledge, Monterey (CA), Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco (CA), pp. 341-352\n\nConverse: Löb's theorem implies the existence of modal fixed points\nNot only does the existence of modal fixed points imply Löb's theorem, but the converse is valid, too.  When Löb's theorem is given as an axiom (schema), the existence of a fixed point (up to provable equivalence)  for any formula A(p) modalized in p can be derived.  Thus in normal modal logic, Löb's axiom is equivalent to the conjunction of the axiom schema 4,  and the existence of modal fixed points.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n Löb's theorem at PlanetMath\n The Cartoon Guide to Löb’s Theorem by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n\nCategory:Mathematical logic\nCategory:Modal logic\nCategory:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics\nCategory:Metatheorems\nCategory:Provability logic\nCategory:Mathematical axioms"

      "title": "Mario Pieri",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Pieri",
      "text": "Mario Pieri (22 June 1860 – 1 March 1913) was an Italian mathematician who is known for his work on foundations of geometry.\n\nBiography\nPieri was born in Lucca, Italy, the son of Pellegrino Pieri and Ermina Luporini. Pellegrino was a lawyer. Pieri began his higher education at University of Bologna where he drew the attention of Salvatore Pincherle. Obtaining a scholarship, Pieri transferred to Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. There he took his degree in 1884 and worked first at a technical secondary school in Pisa.\n\nWhen the opportunity to teach projective geometry at the military academy in Turin arose, Pieri moved there. By 1888 he was assisting in instructing that subject also at the University of Turin. In 1891 he became libero docente at the university, giving elective courses. Pieri continued teaching in Turin until 1900 when he won a competition for the position of extraordinary professor at University of Catania on the island of Sicily. In 1908 he moved to University of Parma, and in 1911 fell ill. Pieri died in Andrea di Compito (Capannori), not far from Lucca.\n\nVon Staudt's Geometrie der Lage (1847) was a much admired text on projective geometry. In 1889 Pieri translated it as Geometria di Posizione, a publication that included a study of the life and work of von Staudt written by Corrado Segre, the initiator of the project.\n\nPieri also came under the influence of Giuseppe Peano at Turin. He contributed to the Formulario mathematico, and Peano placed nine of Pieri's papers for publication with the Academy of Sciences of Turin between 1895 and 1912. They shared a passion for reducing geometric ideas to their logical form and expressing these ideas symbolically.\n\nIn 1898 Pieri wrote I principii della geometria di posizione composti in un sistema logico-deduttivo. According to J.T. Smith (2010) it is\nbased on nineteen sequentially independent axioms – each independent of the preceding ones – which are introduced one by one as they are needed in the development, thus allowing the reader to determine on which axioms a given theorem depends.\n\nPieri was invited to address the International Congress of Philosophy in 1900 in Paris. Since this was also the year he moved from Turin to Sicily, he declined to attend but sent a paper \"Sur la Géométrie envisagée comme un système purement logique\" which was delivered by Louis Couturat. The ideas were also advanced by Alessandro Padoa at both that Congress and the International Congress of Mathematicians also held in Paris that year.\n\nIn 1900 Pieri wrote Monographia del punto e del moto, which Smith calls the Point and Motion memoire. It is noteworthy as using only two primitive notions, point and motion to develop axioms for geometry. Alessandro Padoa shared in this expression of Peano's logico-geometrical program that reduced the number of primitive notions from the four used by Moritz Pasch.\n\nThe research into the foundations of geometry led to another formulation in 1908 in a Point and Sphere memoire. Smith (2010) describes it as\na full axiomatization of Euclidean geometry based solely on the primitive concepts point and equidistance of two points N and P from a third point O, written ON = OP.\nThis memoire was translated into Polish in 1915 by S. Kwietniewski. A young Alfred Tarski encountered the text and carried forward Pieri's program, as recounted by Smith.\n\nIn 2002 Avellone, Brigaglia & Zappulla gave a modern evaluation of Pieri's contribution to geometry:\nPieri's work was very influential. B. Russell and L. Couturat rightly regarded him as the founder of mathematics as a hypothetical-deductive science. His precision, his rigour, and his analytical clarity are unrivaled by other Italian geometers, perhaps with the exception of Peano.\n\nGiuseppe Peano wrote this tribute to Pieri upon his death:\nPieri was totally dedicated to science and teaching. He was an untiring worker, honest, and of a singular modesty. When, some twenty years ago, the professors in Italy agitated for higher salaries, Pieri declared that their salaries were already above the work they did and their merit.\nfrom Hubert C. Kennedy (1980), Peano, page 142, D.

It is a three-dimensional generalization of the one-dimensional Cantor set and two-dimensional Sierpinski carpet. It was first described by Karl Menger in 1926, in his studies of the concept of topological dimension.. English translation reprinted in \n\nConstruction\nthumb|Image 3: A sculptural representation of iterations 0 (bottom) to 3 (top).\n\nThe construction of a Menger sponge can be described as follows:\n Begin with a cube (Image 2 - first from left).\n Divide every face of the cube into 9 squares, like a Rubik's Cube. This will sub-divide the cube into 27 smaller cubes.\n Remove the smaller cube in the middle of each face, and remove the smaller cube in the very center of the larger cube, leaving 20 smaller cubes (Image 2 - second from left). This is a level-1 Menger sponge (resembling a Void Cube).\n Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each of the remaining smaller cubes, and continue to iterate ad infinitum.\n\nThe second iteration gives a level-2 sponge (Image 2 - third from left), the third iteration gives a level-3 sponge (Image 2 - 4th from left), and so on. The Menger sponge itself is the limit of this process after an infinite number of iterations.\n\nthumb|none|500px|Image 2: An illustration of the iterative construction of a Menger sponge up to M3, the third iteration.\nthumb|250px| Menger sponge animation through (4) recursion steps.\n\nProperties\nthumb|link=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Menger_sponge_diagonal_section.svg|True view of the cross-section of a level-4 Menger sponge through its centroid and perpendicular to a space diagonal. In this interactive SVG, the cross-sections are true-view and to scale.\nThe nth stage of the Menger sponge, Mn, is made up of 20n smaller cubes, each with a side length of (1/3)n.  The total volume of Mn is thus (20/27)n.  The total surface area of Mn is given by the expression 2(20/9)n + 4(8/9)n.Wolfram Demonstrations Project, Volume and Surface Area of the Menger SpongeUniversity of British Columbia Science and Mathematics Education Research Group, Mathematics Geometry: Menger Sponge Therefore the construction's volume approaches zero while its surface area increases without bound. Yet any chosen surface in the construction will be thoroughly punctured as the construction continues, so that the limit is neither a solid nor a surface; it has a topological dimension of 1 and is accordingly identified as a curve.\n\nEach face of the construction becomes a Sierpinski carpet, and the intersection of the sponge with any diagonal of the cube or any midline of the faces is a Cantor set. The cross section of the sponge through its centroid and perpendicular to a space diagonal is a regular hexagon punctured with hexagrams arranged in six-fold symmetry. The number of these hexagrams, in descending size, is given by , with .\n\nThe sponge's Hausdorff dimension is  ≅ 2.727. The Lebesgue covering dimension of the Menger sponge is one, the same as any curve. Menger showed, in the 1926 construction, that the sponge is a universal curve, in that every  is homeomorphic to a subset of the Menger sponge, where a curve means any compact metric space of Lebesgue covering dimension one; this includes trees and graphs with an arbitrary countable number of edges, vertices and closed loops, connected in arbitrary ways. In a similar way, the Sierpinski carpet is a universal curve for all curves that can be drawn on the two-dimensional plane. The Menger sponge constructed in three dimensions extends this idea to graphs that are not planar, and might be embedded in any number of dimensions.\n\nThe Menger sponge is a closed set; since it is also bounded, the Heine–Borel theorem implies that it is compact. It has Lebesgue measure 0. Because it contains continuous paths, it is an uncountable set.\n\nFormal definition\nFormally, a Menger sponge can be defined as follows:\n\nwhere M0 is the unit cube and\n\nMegaMenger\nthumb|right|A model of a tetrix viewed through the centre of the Cambridge Level-3 MegaMenger at the 2015 Cambridge Science Festival\nthumb|right|One of the MegaMengers, at the University of Bath\nMegaMenger was a project aiming to build the largest fractal model, pioneered by Matt Parker of Queen Mary University of London and Laura Taalman of James Madison University. Each small cube is made from 6 interlocking folded business cards, giving a total of 960 000 for a level-four sponge. The outer surfaces are then covered with paper or cardboard panels printed with a Sierpinski carpet design to be more aesthetically pleasing.

He describes his Hegelian period and includes hitherto unpublished notes for a Hegelian philosophy of science.  He deals next with the two-fold revolution involved with his abandonment of idealism and adoption of a mathematical logic founded upon that of Giuseppe Peano.  After two chapters on Principia Mathematica (1910-1913), he passes to the problems of perception as dealt with in Our Knowledge of the External World (1914).  In a chapter on ‘The Impact of Wittgenstein’, Russell examines what he now thinks must be accepted and what rejected in that philosopher’s work.  He notes the changes from earlier theories required by the adoption of William James’s view that sensation is not essentially relational and is not per se a form of knowledge. In an explanatory chapter, he endeavours to remove misconceptions of and objections to his theories as to the relation of perception to scientific knowledge. Russell concludes with a reprint of some articles on modern Oxford philosophy.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1959 books\nCategory:Allen & Unwin books\nCategory:Biographies and autobiographies of mathematicians\nCategory:Books by Bertrand Russell\nCategory:English-language books"

      "title": "Naive set theory",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory",
      "text": "Naïve set theory is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics.\nJeff Miller writes that naïve set theory (as opposed to axiomatic set theory) was used occasionally in the 1940s and became an established term in the 1950s. It appears in Hermann Weyl's review of P. A. Schilpp (Ed). (1946). “The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell” American Mathematical Monthly, 53(4), p. 210 and in a review by Laszlo Kalmar. (1946). “The Paradox of Kleene and Rosser”. Journal of Symbolic Logic, 11(4), p. 136. (JSTOR).  The term was later popularized in a book by Paul Halmos (1960). Naïve Set Theory.\nUnlike axiomatic set theories, which are defined using formal logic, naïve set theory is defined informally, in natural language. It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics (for example Venn diagrams and symbolic reasoning about their Boolean algebra), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.. \"The working mathematicians usually thought in terms of a naïve set theory (probably one more or less equivalent to ZF) ... a practical requirement [of any new foundational system] could be that this system could be used \"naïvely\" by mathematicians not sophisticated in foundational research\" (p. 236).\n\nSets are of great importance in mathematics; in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects (numbers, relations, functions, etc.) are defined in terms of sets. Naïve set theory suffices for many purposes, while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments. \n\nMethod\nA naïve theory in the sense of \"naïve set theory\" is a non-formalized theory, that is, a theory that uses a natural language to describe sets and operations on sets. The words and, or, if ... then, not, for some, for every are treated as in ordinary mathematics. As a matter of convenience, use of naïve set theory and its formalism prevails even in higher mathematics – including in more formal settings of set theory itself.\n\nThe first development of set theory was a naïve set theory. It was created at the end of the 19th century by Georg Cantor as part of his study of infinite sets and developed by Gottlob Frege in his Begriffsschrift.\n\nNaïve set theory may refer to several very distinct notions. It may refer to\n Informal presentation of an axiomatic set theory, e.g. as in Naïve Set Theory by Paul Halmos.\n Early or later versions of Georg Cantor's theory and other informal systems.\n Decidedly inconsistent theories (whether axiomatic or not), such as a theory of Gottlob Frege In Volume 2, Jena 1903. pp. 253-261 Frege discusses the antionomy in the afterword. that yielded Russell's paradox, and theories of Giuseppe Peano Axiom 52. chap. IV produces antinomies. and Richard Dedekind.\n\nParadoxes\nThe assumption that any property may be used to form a set, without restriction, leads to paradoxes.  One common example is Russell's paradox: there is no set consisting of \"all sets that do not contain themselves\". Thus consistent systems of naïve set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets.\n\nCantor's theory\nSome believe that Georg Cantor's set theory was not actually implicated in the set-theoretic paradoxes (see Frápolli 1991). One difficulty in determining this with certainty is that Cantor did not provide an axiomatization of his system. By 1899, Cantor was aware of some of the paradoxes following from unrestricted interpretation of his theory, for instance Cantor's paradoxLetter from Cantor to David Hilbert on September 26, 1897,  p. 388. and the Burali-Forti paradox,Letter from Cantor to Richard Dedekind on August 3, 1899,  p. 408. and did not believe that they discredited his theory.Letters from Cantor to Richard Dedekind on August 3, 1899 and on August 30, 1899,  p. 448 (System aller denkbaren Klassen) and  p. 407. (There is no set of all sets.) Cantor's paradox can actually be derived from the above (false) assumption—that any property  may be used to form a set—using for  is a cardinal number\". Frege explicitly axiomatized a theory in which a formalized version of naïve set theory can be interpreted, and it is this formal theory which Bertrand Russell actually addressed when he presented his paradox, not necessarily a theory Cantor, who, as mentioned, was aware of several paradoxes, presumably had in mind.\n\nAxiomatic theories\nAxiomatic set theory was developed in response to these early attempts to understand sets, with the goal of determining precisely what operations were allowed and when.\n\nConsistency\nA naïve set theory is not necessarily inconsistent, if it correctly specifies the sets allowed to be considered. This can be done by the means of definitions, which are implicit axioms. It is possible to state all the axioms explicitly, as in the case of Halmos' Naïve Set Theory, which is actually an informal presentation of the usual axiomatic Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. It is \"naïve\" in that the language and notations are those of ordinary informal mathematics, and in that it doesn't deal with consistency or completeness of the axiom system.\n\nLikewise, an axiomatic set theory is not necessarily consistent: not necessarily free of paradoxes. It follows from Gödel's incompleteness theorems that a sufficiently complicated first order logic system (which includes most common axiomatic set theories) cannot be proved consistent from within the theory itself – even if it actually is consistent. However, the common axiomatic systems are generally believed to be consistent; by their axioms they do exclude some paradoxes, like Russell's paradox. Based on Gödel's theorem, it is just not known – and never can be – if there are no paradoxes at all in these theories or in any first-order set theory.\n\nThe term naïve set theory is still today also used in some literature to refer to the set theories studied by Frege and Cantor, rather than to the informal counterparts of modern axiomatic set theory.\n\nUtility\nThe choice between an axiomatic approach and other approaches is largely a matter of convenience. In everyday mathematics the best choice may be informal use of axiomatic set theory.  References to particular axioms typically then occur only when demanded by tradition, e.g. the axiom of choice is often mentioned when used. Likewise, formal proofs occur only when warranted by exceptional circumstances. This informal usage of axiomatic set theory can have (depending on notation) precisely the appearance of naïve set theory as outlined below. It is considerably easier to read and write (in the formulation of most statements, proofs, and lines of discussion) and is less error-prone than a strictly formal approach.\n\n Sets, membership and equality \nIn naïve set theory, a set is described as a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called the elements or members of the set. Objects can be anything: numbers, people, other sets, etc. For instance, 4 is a member of the set of all even integers. Clearly, the set of even numbers is infinitely large; there is no requirement that a set be finite.\n\nthumb|Passage with the original set definition of Georg Cantor\nThe definition of sets goes back to Georg Cantor. He wrote 1915 in his article Beiträge zur Begründung der transfiniten Mengenlehre:\n\n“Unter einer 'Menge' verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung M von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objekten unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens (welche die 'Elemente' von M genannt werden) zu einem Ganzen.” – Georg Cantor\n“A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thought—which are called elements of the set.” – Georg Cantor\n\nthumb|right|First usage of the symbol ϵ in the work Arithmetices principia nova methodo exposita by Giuseppe Peano.\n\n Note on consistency \nIt does not follow from this definition how sets can be formed, and what operations on sets again will produce a set. The term \"well-defined\" in \"well-defined collection of objects\" cannot, by itself, guarantee the consistency and unambiguity of what exactly constitutes and what does not constitute a set. Attempting to achieve this would be the realm of axiomatic set theory or of axiomatic class theory.\n\nThe problem, in this context, with informally formulated set theories, not derived from (and implying) any particular axiomatic theory, is that there may be several widely differing formalized versions, that have both different sets and different rules for how new sets may be formed, that all conform to the original informal definition. For example, Cantor's verbatim definition allows for considerable freedom in what constitutes a set. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Cantor was particularly interested in sets containing cats and dogs, but rather only in sets containing purely mathematical objects. An example of such a class of sets could be the von Neumann universe. But even when fixing the class of sets under consideration, it is not always clear which rules for set formation are allowed without introducing paradoxes.\n\nFor the purpose of fixing the discussion below, the term \"well-defined\" should instead be interpreted as an intention, with either implicit or explicit rules (axioms or definitions), to rule out inconsistencies. The purpose is to keep the often deep and difficult issues of consistency away from the, usually simpler, context at hand. An explicit ruling out of all conceivable inconsistencies (paradoxes) cannot be achieved for an axiomatic set theory anyway, due to Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, so this does not at all hamper the utility of naïve set theory as compared to axiomatic set theory in the simple contexts considered below. It merely simplifies the discussion. Consistency is henceforth taken for granted unless explicitly mentioned.\n\n Membership \nIf x is a member of a set A, then it is also said that x belongs to A, or that x is in A. This is denoted by x ∈ A. The symbol ∈ is a derivation from the lowercase Greek letter epsilon, \"ε\", introduced by Giuseppe Peano in 1889 and shall be the first letter of the word ἐστί (means \"is\"). The symbol ∉ is often used to write x ∉ A, meaning \"x is not in A\".\n\n Equality \nTwo sets A and B are defined to be equal when they have precisely the same elements, that is, if every element of A is an element of B and every element of B is an element of A. (See axiom of extensionality.) Thus a set is completely determined by its elements; the description is immaterial. For example, the set with elements 2, 3, and 5 is equal to the set of all prime numbers less than 6.\nIf the sets A and B are equal, this is denoted symbolically as A = B (as usual).\n\n Empty set \nThe empty set, often denoted Ø and sometimes , is a set with no members at all. Because a set is determined completely by its elements, there can be only one empty set. (See axiom of empty set.) Although the empty set has no members, it can be a member of other sets. Thus Ø ≠ {Ø}, because the former has no members and the latter has one member. In mathematics, the only sets with which one needs to be concerned can be built up from the empty set alone.()\n\n Specifying sets \nThe simplest way to describe a set is to list its elements between curly braces (known as defining a set extensionally). Thus  denotes the set whose only elements are  and .\n(See axiom of pairing.)\nNote the following points:\nThe order of elements is immaterial; for example, .\nRepetition (multiplicity) of elements is irrelevant; for example, .\n(These are consequences of the definition of equality in the previous section.)\n\nThis notation can be informally abused by saying something like  to indicate the set of all dogs, but this example would usually be read by mathematicians as \"the set containing the single element dogs\".\n\nAn extreme (but correct) example of this notation is , which denotes the empty set.\n\nThe notation , or sometimes , is used to denote the set containing all objects for which the condition  holds (known as defining a set intensionally).\nFor example,  ∈ R} denotes the set of real numbers,  denotes the set of everything with blonde hair.\n\nThis notation is called set-builder notation (or \"set comprehension\", particularly in the context of Functional programming).\nSome variants of set builder notation are:\n denotes the set of all  that are already members of  such that the condition  holds for . For example, if  is the set of integers, then  is the set of all even integers. (See axiom of specification.)\n denotes the set of all objects obtained by putting members of the set  into the formula . For example,  is again the set of all even integers. (See axiom of replacement.)\n is the most general form of set builder notation. For example, {{math|{xs owner : x is a dog}}} is the set of all dog owners.\n\n Subsets \nGiven two sets A and B, A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B.\nIn particular, each set B is a subset of itself; a subset of B that is not equal to B is called a proper subset.\n\nIf A is a subset of B, then one can also say that B is a superset of A, that A is contained in B, or that B contains A. In symbols, A ⊆ B means that A is a subset of B, and B ⊇ A means that B is a superset of A.\nSome authors use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ for subsets, and others use these symbols only for proper subsets. For clarity, one can explicitly use the symbols ⊊ and ⊋ to indicate non-equality.\n\nAs an illustration, let R be the set of real numbers, let Z be the set of integers, let O be the set of odd integers, and let P be the set of current or former U.S. Presidents.\nThen O is a subset of Z, Z is a subset of R, and (hence) O is a subset of R, where in all cases subset may even be read as proper subset.\nNote that not all sets are comparable in this way. For example, it is not the case either that R is a subset of P nor that P is a subset of R.\n\nIt follows immediately from the definition of equality of sets above that, given two sets A and B, A = B if and only if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A. In fact this is often given as the definition of equality. Usually when trying to prove that two sets are equal, one aims to show these two inclusions. Note that the empty set is a subset of every set (the statement that all elements of the empty set are also members of any set A is vacuously true).\n\nThe set of all subsets of a given set A is called the power set of A and is denoted by  or ; the \"P\" is sometimes in a script font. If the set A has n elements, then  will have  elements.\n\n Universal sets and absolute complements \nIn certain contexts, one may consider all sets under consideration as being subsets of some given universal set.\nFor instance, when investigating properties of the real numbers R (and subsets of R), R may be taken as the universal set. A true universal set is not included in standard set theory (see Paradoxes below), but is included in some non-standard set theories.\n\nGiven a universal set U and a subset A of U, the complement of A (in U) is defined as\nAC := {x ∈ U''' : x ∉ A}.\nIn other words, AC (\"A-complement\"; sometimes simply A, \"A-prime\" ) is the set of all members of U which are not members of A.\nThus with R, Z and O defined as in the section on subsets, if Z is the universal set, then OC is the set of even integers, while if R is the universal set, then OC is the set of all real numbers that are either even integers or not integers at all.\n\n Unions, intersections, and relative complements \nGiven two sets A and B, their union is the set consisting of all objects which are elements of A or of B or of both (see axiom of union). It is denoted by A ∪ B.\n\nThe intersection of A and B is the set of all objects which are both in A and in B. It is denoted by A ∩ B.\n\nFinally, the relative complement of B relative to A, also known as the set theoretic difference of A and B, is the set of all objects that belong to A but not to B. It is written as A \\ B or A − B.\n\nSymbolically, these are respectively\nA ∪ B := {x : (x ∈ A) or (x ∈ B)};\nA ∩ B := {x : (x ∈ A) and (x ∈ B)} = {x ∈ A : x ∈ B} = {x ∈ B : x ∈ A};\nA \\ B := {x : (x ∈ A) and not (x ∈ B) } = {x ∈ A : not (x ∈ B)}.\n\nNotice that A doesn't have to be a subset of B for B \\ A to make sense; this is the difference between the relative complement and the absolute complement (AC = U \\ A) from the previous section.\n\nTo illustrate these ideas, let A be the set of left-handed people, and let B be the set of people with blond hair. Then A ∩ B is the set of all left-handed blond-haired people, while A ∪ B is the set of all people who are left-handed or blond-haired or both. A \\ B, on the other hand, is the set of all people that are left-handed but not blond-haired, while B \\ A is the set of all people who have blond hair but aren't left-handed.\n\nNow let E be the set of all human beings, and let F be the set of all living things over 1000 years old. What is E ∩ F in this case? No living human being is over 1000 years old, so E ∩ F must be the empty set {}.\n\nFor any set A, the power set  is a Boolean algebra under the operations of union and intersection.\n\n Ordered pairs and Cartesian products \nIntuitively, an ordered pair is simply a collection of two objects such that one can be distinguished as the first element and the other as the second element, and having the fundamental property that, two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their first elements are equal and their second elements are equal.\n\nFormally, an ordered pair with first coordinate a, and second coordinate b, usually denoted by (a, b), can be defined as the set {{a}, {a, b}}.\n\nIt follows that, two ordered pairs (a,b) and (c,d) are equal if and only if a = c and b = d.\n\nAlternatively, an ordered pair can be formally thought of as a set {a,b} with a total order.\n\n(The notation (a, b) is also used to denote an open interval on the real number line, but the context should make it clear which meaning is intended. Otherwise, the notation ]a, b[ may be used to denote the open interval whereas (a, b) is used for the ordered pair).\n\nIf A and B are sets, then the Cartesian product (or simply product) is defined to be:\nA × B = {(a,b) : a is in A and b is in B}.\nThat is, A × B is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an element of A and whose second coordinate is an element of B.\n\nThis definition may be extended to a set A × B × C of ordered triples, and more generally to sets of ordered n-tuples for any positive integer n.\nIt is even possible to define infinite Cartesian products, but this requires a more recondite definition of the product.\n\nCartesian products were first developed by René Descartes in the context of analytic geometry. If R denotes the set of all real numbers, then R2 := R × R represents the Euclidean plane and R3 := R × R × R represents three-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\n Some important sets \nThere are some ubiquitous sets that for which the notation is almost universal. Some of these are listed below. In the list, a, b, and c refer natural numbers, and r and s are real numbers.\n Natural numbers are used for counting. A blackboard bold capital N () often represents this set.\n Integers appear as solutions for x in equations like x + a = b. A blackboard bold capital Z () often represents this set (from the German Zahlen, meaning numbers).\n Rational numbers appear as solutions to equations like a + bx = c. A blackboard bold capital Q () often represents this set (for quotient, because R is used for the set of real numbers).\n Algebraic numbers appear as solutions to polynomial equations (with integer coefficients) and may involve radicals (including ) and certain other irrational numbers. A Q with an overline () often represents this set. The overline denotes the operation of algebraic closure.\n Real numbers represent the \"real line\" and include all numbers that can be approximated by rationals. These numbers may be rational or algebraic but may also be transcendental numbers, which cannot appear as solutions to polynomial equations with rational coefficients. A blackboard bold capital R () often represents this set.\n Complex numbers are sums of a real and an imaginary number: . Here either  or  (or both) can be zero; thus, the set of real numbers and the set of strictly imaginary numbers are subsets of the set of complex numbers, which form an algebraic closure for the set of real numbers, meaning that every polynomial with coefficients in  has at least one root in this set. A blackboard bold capital C () often represents this set. Note that since a number  can be identified with a point  in the plane,  is basically \"the same\" as the Cartesian product × (\"the same\" meaning that any point in one determines a unique point in the other and for the result of calculations, it doesn't matter which one is used for the calculation, as long as multiplication rule is appropriate for ).\n\n Paradoxes in early set theory \n\nThe unrestricted formation principle of sets referred to as the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension,\nIf  is a property, then there exists a set  (false), p. 4.\nis the source of several early appearing paradoxes:\n leads 1897 to the Burali-Forti paradox, the first published antinomy.\n produced Cantor's paradox in 1897.\n yielded Cantor's second antinomy in the year 1899. Here the property  is true for all , whatever  may be, so  would be a universal set, containing everything.\n, i.e. the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as elements gave Russell's paradox 1902.\n\nIf the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is weakened to the axiom schema of specification or axiom schema of separation,\nIf  is a property, then for any set  there exists a set ,\nthen all the above paradoxes disappear. There is a corollary. With the axiom schema of separation as an axiom of the theory, it follows, as a theorem of the theory:\nThe set of all sets does not exist.\nOr, more spectacularly (Halmos' phrasing): There is no universe. Proof: Suppose that it exists and call it . Now apply the axiom schema of separation with  and for  use . This leads to Russell's paradox again. Hence  can't exist in this theory.\n\nRelated to the above constructions is formation of the set\n, where the statement following the implication certainly is false. It follows, from the definition of , using the usual inference rules (and some afterthought when reading the proof in the linked article below) both that  and  holds, hence . This is Curry's paradox.\n\nIt is (perhaps surprisingly) not the possibility of  that is problematic. It is again the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension allowing  for . With the axiom schema of specification instead of unrestricted comprehension, the conclusion  doesn't hold and, hence  is not a logical consequence.\n\nNonetheless, the possibility of  is often removed explicitly See discussion around Russell's paradox. or, e.g. in ZFC, implicitly, Section 1.6. by demanding the axiom of regularity to hold. One consequence of it is\nThere is no set  for which ,\nor, in other words, no set is an element of itself. p. 61.\n\nThe axiom schema of separation is simply too weak (while unrestricted comprehension is a very strong axiom—too strong for set theory) to develop set theory with its usual operations and constructions outlined above. The axiom of regularity is of a restrictive nature as well. Therefore, one is led to the formulation of other axioms to guarantee the existence of enough sets to form a set theory. Some of these have been described informally above and many others are possible. Not all conceivable axioms can be combined freely into consistent theories. For example, the axiom of choice of ZFC is incompatible with the conceivable every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable'. The former implies the latter is false.\n\nSee also\n\n Algebra of sets\n Axiomatic set theory\n Internal set theory\n Set theory\n Set (mathematics)\n Partially ordered set\n\n Notes \n\nReferences\n Bourbaki, N., Elements of the History of Mathematics, John Meldrum (trans.), Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, 1994.\n\n Devlin, K.J., The Joy of Sets: Fundamentals of Contemporary Set Theory, 2nd edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, 1993.\n María J.

      "text": "thumb|250x250px|The prime factorisation of the integers is a central point of study in number theory and can be visualised with this Ulam spiral variant. Number theory seeks to understand the properties of integer systems like this, in spite of their apparent complexity.\nNumber theory (or arithmetic or higher arithmetic in older usage) is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\" Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (for example, rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers).\n\nIntegers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry). Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects (for example, the Riemann zeta function) that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion (analytic number theory). One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers, for example, as approximated by the latter (Diophantine approximation).\n\nThe older term for number theory is arithmetic. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by \"number theory\".Already in 1921, T. L. Heath had to explain: \"By arithmetic, Plato meant, not arithmetic in our sense, but the science which considers numbers in themselves, in other words, what we mean by the Theory of Numbers.\"  (The word \"arithmetic\" is used by the general public to mean \"elementary calculations\"; it has also acquired other meanings in mathematical logic, as in Peano arithmetic, and computer science, as in floating point arithmetic.) The use of the term arithmetic for number theory regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century, arguably in part due to French influence.Take, for example, . In 1952, Davenport still had to specify that he meant The Higher Arithmetic. Hardy and Wright wrote in the introduction to An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers (1938): \"We proposed at one time to change [the title] to An introduction to arithmetic, a more novel and in some ways a more appropriate title; but it was pointed out that this might lead to misunderstandings about the content of the book.\"  In particular, arithmetical is preferred as an adjective to number-theoretic.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nDawn of arithmetic\nright|thumb|The Plimpton 322 tablet\nThe first historical find of an arithmetical nature is a fragment of a table: the broken clay tablet Plimpton 322 (Larsa, Mesopotamia, ca. 1800 BCE) contains a list of \"Pythagorean triples\", that is, integers  such that .\nThe triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by brute force. The heading over the first column reads: \"The takiltum of the diagonal which has been subtracted such that the width...\". The term takiltum is problematic. Robson prefers the rendering \"The holding-square of the diagonal from which 1 is torn out, so that the short side comes up...\".\n\nThe table's layout suggests. Other sources give the modern formula . Van der Waerden gives both the modern formula and what amounts to the form preferred by Robson. that it was constructed by means of what amounts, in modern language, to the identity\n\nwhich is implicit in routine Old Babylonian exercises. If some other method was used,Neugebauer  discusses the table in detail and mentions in passing Euclid's method in modern notation . the triples were first constructed and then reordered by , presumably for actual use as a \"table\", for example, with a view to applications.\n\nIt is not known what these applications may have been, or whether there could have been any; Babylonian astronomy, for example, truly came into its own only later. It has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems.. This is controversial. See Plimpton 322. Robson's article is written polemically  with a view to \"perhaps [...] knocking [Plimpton 322] off its pedestal\" ; at the same time, it settles to the conclusion that [...] the question \"how was the tablet calculated?\" does not have to have the same answer as the question \"what problems does the tablet set?\" The first can be answered most satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs, as first suggested half a century ago, and the second by some sort of right-triangle problems . \nRobson takes issue with the notion that the scribe who produced Plimpton 322 (who had to \"work for a living\", and would not have belonged to a \"leisured middle class\") could have been motivated by his own \"idle curiosity\" in the absence of a \"market for new mathematics\".\n\nWhile Babylonian number theory—or what survives of Babylonian mathematics that can be called thus—consists of this single, striking fragment, Babylonian algebra (in the secondary-school sense of \"algebra\") was exceptionally well developed. Late Neoplatonic sourcesIamblichus, Life of Pythagoras,(trans., for example, ) cited in . See also Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras, paragraph 6, in \nVan der Waerden  sustains the view that Thales knew Babylonian mathematics. state that Pythagoras learned mathematics from the Babylonians. Much earlier sourcesHerodotus (II. 81) and Isocrates (Busiris 28), cited in: . On Thales, see Eudemus ap. Proclus, 65.7, (for example, ) cited in: . Proclus was using a work by Eudemus of Rhodes (now lost), the Catalogue of Geometers. See also introduction,  on Proclus's reliability. state that Thales and Pythagoras traveled and studied in Egypt.\n\nEuclid IX 21–34 is very probably Pythagorean;, cited in: . it is very simple material (\"odd times even is even\", \"if an odd number measures [= divides] an even number, then it also measures [= divides] half of it\"), but it is all that is needed to prove that \nis irrational. Pythagorean mystics gave great importance to the odd and the even.\nThe discovery that  is irrational is credited to the early Pythagoreans (pre-Theodorus).Plato, Theaetetus, p. 147 B, (for example, ), cited\nin : \"Theodorus was writing out for us something about roots, such as the roots of three or five, showing that they are incommensurable by the unit;...\" See also Spiral of Theodorus. By revealing (in modern terms) that numbers could be irrational, this discovery seems to have provoked the first foundational crisis in mathematical history; its proof or its divulgation are sometimes credited to Hippasus, who was expelled or split from the Pythagorean sect. This forced a distinction between numbers (integers and the rationals—the subjects of arithmetic), on the one hand, and lengths and proportions (which we would identify with real numbers, whether rational or not), on the other hand.\n\nThe Pythagorean tradition spoke also of so-called polygonal or figurate numbers. While square numbers, cubic numbers, etc., are seen now as more natural than triangular numbers, pentagonal numbers, etc., the study of the sums\nof triangular and pentagonal numbers would prove fruitful in the early modern period (17th to early 19th century).\n\nWe know of no clearly arithmetical material in ancient Egyptian or Vedic sources, though there is some algebra in both. The Chinese remainder theorem appears as an exercise Sunzi Suanjing, Chapter 3, Problem 26. This can be found in , which contains a full translation of the Suan Ching (based on ). See also the discussion in . in Sunzi Suanjing (3rd, 4th or 5th century CE.)The date of the text has been narrowed down to 220–420 CE (Yan Dunjie) or 280–473 CE (Wang Ling) through internal evidence (= taxation systems assumed in the text). See . (There is one important step glossed over in Sunzi's solution:Sunzi Suanjing, Ch. 3, Problem 26,\nin :[26] Now there are an unknown number of things. If we count by threes, there is a remainder 2; if we count by fives, there is a remainder 3; if we count by sevens, there is a remainder 2. Find the number of things. Answer: 23.\nMethod: If we count by threes and there is a remainder 2, put down 140. If we count by fives and there is a remainder 3, put down 63. If we count by sevens and there is a remainder 2, put down 30. Add them to obtain 233 and subtract 210 to get the answer. If we count by threes and there is a remainder 1, put down 70. If we count by fives and there is a remainder 1, put down 21. If we count by sevens and there is a remainder 1, put down 15. When [a number] exceeds 106, the result is obtained by subtracting 105. it is the problem that was later solved by Āryabhaṭa's Kuṭṭaka – see below.)\n\nThere is also some numerical mysticism in Chinese mathematics,See, for example, Sunzi Suanjing, Ch. 3, Problem 36, in :[36] Now there is a pregnant woman whose age is 29. If the gestation period is 9 months, determine the sex of the unborn child. Answer: Male.\nMethod: Put down 49, add the gestation period and subtract the age. From the remainder take away 1 representing the heaven, 2 the earth, 3 the man, 4 the four seasons, 5 the five phases, 6 the six pitch-pipes, 7 the seven stars [of the Dipper], 8 the eight winds, and 9 the nine divisions [of China under Yu the Great]. If the remainder is odd, [the sex] is male and if the remainder is even, [the sex] is female.\nThis is the last problem in Sunzi's otherwise matter-of-fact treatise. but, unlike that of the Pythagoreans, it seems to have led nowhere. Like the Pythagoreans' perfect numbers, magic squares have passed from superstition into recreation.\n\nClassical Greece and the early Hellenistic period\n\nAside from a few fragments, the mathematics of Classical Greece is known to us either through the reports of contemporary non-mathematicians or through mathematical works from the early Hellenistic period. In the case of number theory, this means, by and large, Plato and Euclid, respectively.\n\nWhile Asian mathematics influenced Greek and Hellenistic learning, it seems to be the case that Greek mathematics is also an indigenous tradition.\n\nEusebius, PE X, chapter 4 mentions of Pythagoras:\n\n\"In fact the said Pythagoras, while busily studying the wisdom of each nation, visited Babylon, and Egypt, and all Persia, being instructed by the Magi and the priests: and in addition to these he is related to have studied under the Brahmans (these are Indian philosophers); and from some he gathered astrology, from others geometry, and arithmetic and music from others, and different things from different nations, and only from the wise men of Greece did he get nothing, wedded as they were to a poverty and dearth of wisdom: so on the contrary he himself became the author of instruction to the Greeks in the learning which he had procured from abroad.\"\n\nAristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans,Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a) and Cicero repeats this claim: Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia (\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\").Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.\n\nPlato had a keen interest in mathematics, and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and calculation. (By arithmetic he meant, in part, theorising on number, rather than what arithmetic or number theory have come to mean.) It is through one of Plato's dialogues—namely, Theaetetus—that we know that Theodorus had proven that  are irrational. Theaetetus was, like Plato, a disciple of Theodorus's; he worked on distinguishing different kinds of incommensurables, and was thus arguably a pioneer in the study of number systems. (Book X of Euclid's Elements is described by Pappus as being largely based on Theaetetus's work.)\n\nEuclid devoted part of his Elements to prime numbers and divisibility, topics that belong unambiguously to number theory and are basic to it (Books VII to IX of Euclid's Elements). In particular, he gave an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers (the Euclidean algorithm; Elements, Prop. VII.2) and the first known proof of the infinitude of primes (Elements, Prop. IX.20).\n\nIn 1773, Lessing published an epigram he had found in a manuscript during his work as a librarian; it claimed to be a letter sent by Archimedes to Eratosthenes. The epigram proposed what has become known as\nArchimedes's cattle problem; its solution (absent from the manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces to what would later be misnamed Pell's equation). As far as we know, such equations were first successfully treated by the Indian school. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.\n\nDiophantus\nthumb|upright|Title page of the 1621 edition of Diophantus's Arithmetica, translated into Latin by Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac.\n\nVery little is known about Diophantus of Alexandria; he probably lived in the third century CE, that is, about five hundred years after Euclid. Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantus's Arithmetica survive in the original Greek; four more books survive in an Arabic translation. The Arithmetica is a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form  or . Thus, nowadays, we speak of Diophantine equations when we speak of polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions must be found.\n\nOne may say that Diophantus was studying rational points, that is, points whose coordinates are rational—on curves and algebraic varieties; however, unlike the Greeks of the Classical period, who did what we would now call basic algebra in geometrical terms, Diophantus did what we would now call basic algebraic geometry in purely algebraic terms. In modern language, what Diophantus did was to find rational parametrizations of varieties; that is, given an equation of the form (say)\n, his aim was to find (in essence) three rational functions  such that, for all values of  and , setting\n for  gives a solution to \n\nDiophantus also studied the equations of some non-rational curves, for which no rational parametrisation is possible. He managed to find some rational points on these curves (elliptic curves, as it happens, in what seems to be their first known occurrence) by means of what amounts to a tangent construction: translated into coordinate geometry\n(which did not exist in Diophantus's time), his method would be visualised as drawing a tangent to a curve at a known rational point, and then finding the other point of intersection of the tangent with the curve; that other point is a new rational point. (Diophantus also resorted to what could be called a special case of a secant construction.)\n\nWhile Diophantus was concerned largely with rational solutions, he assumed some results on integer numbers, in particular that every integer is the sum of four squares (though he never stated as much explicitly).\n\nĀryabhaṭa, Brahmagupta, Bhāskara\nWhile Greek astronomy probably influenced Indian learning, to the point of introducing trigonometry, it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition;Any early contact between Babylonian and Indian mathematics remains conjectural . in particular, there is no evidence that Euclid's Elements reached India before the 18th century.\n\nĀryabhaṭa (476–550 CE) showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences ,  could be solved by a method he called kuṭṭaka, or pulveriser;Āryabhaṭa, Āryabhatīya, Chapter 2, verses 32–33, cited in: . See also . A slightly more explicit description of the kuṭṭaka was later given in Brahmagupta, Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, XVIII, 3–5 (in , cited in ). this is a procedure close to (a generalisation of) the Euclidean algorithm, which was probably discovered independently in India. Āryabhaṭa seems to have had in mind applications to astronomical calculations.\n\nBrahmagupta (628 CE) started the systematic study of indefinite quadratic equations—in particular, the misnamed Pell equation, in which Archimedes may have first been interested, and which did not start to be solved in the West until the time of Fermat and Euler. Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmagupta's technical terminology. A general procedure (the chakravala, or \"cyclic method\") for solving Pell's equation was finally found by Jayadeva (cited in the eleventh century; his work is otherwise lost); the earliest surviving exposition appears in Bhāskara II's Bīja-gaṇita (twelfth century).\n\nIndian mathematics remained largely unknown in Europe until the late eighteenth century; Brahmagupta and Bhāskara's work was translated into English in 1817 by Henry Colebrooke.\n\nArithmetic in the Islamic golden age\n\nupright|right|thumb|Al-Haytham seen by the West: frontispice of Selenographia, showing Alhasen  representing knowledge through reason, and Galileo representing knowledge through the senses.\n\nIn the early ninth century, the caliph Al-Ma'mun ordered translations of many Greek mathematical works and at least one Sanskrit work (the Sindhind,\nwhich may , cited in . See also the preface in\n cited in  or may not, and , cited in . be Brahmagupta's Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta).\nDiophantus's main work, the Arithmetica, was translated into Arabic by Qusta ibn Luqa (820–912).\nPart of the treatise al-Fakhri (by al-Karajī, 953 – ca. 1029) builds on it to some extent. According to Rashed Roshdi, Al-Karajī's contemporary Ibn al-Haytham knew what would later be called Wilson's theorem.\n\nWestern Europe in the Middle Ages\nOther than a treatise on squares in arithmetic progression by Fibonacci—who traveled and studied in north Africa and Constantinople—no number theory to speak of was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late Renaissance, thanks to a renewed study of the works of Greek antiquity. A catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into Latin of Diophantus' Arithmetica.Bachet, 1621, following a first attempt by Xylander, 1575\n\nEarly modern number theory\nFermat\nthumb|left|upright|Pierre de Fermat\n\nPierre de Fermat (1607–1665) never published his writings; in particular, his work on number theory is contained almost entirely in letters to mathematicians and in private marginal notes. He wrote down nearly no proofs in number theory; he had no models in the area.. This was more so in number theory than in other areas (remark in ). Bachet's own proofs were \"ludicrously clumsy\" . \n\nOne of Fermat's first interests was perfect numbers (which appear in Euclid, Elements IX) and amicable numbers;Perfect and especially amicable numbers are of little or no interest nowadays. The same was not true in medieval times—whether in the West or the Arab-speaking world—due in part to the importance given to them by the Neopythagorean (and hence mystical) Nicomachus (ca. 100 CE), who wrote a primitive but influential \"Introduction to Arithmetic\". See . these topics led him to work on integer divisors, which were from the beginning among the subjects of the\ncorrespondence (1636 onwards) that put him in touch with the mathematical community of the day.. The initial subjects of Fermat's correspondence included divisors (\"aliquot parts\") and many subjects outside number theory; see the list in the letter from Fermat to Roberval, 22.IX.1636, , cited in . \n\nFermat's work in arithmetic includes the following.\n\nFermat's little theorem (1640),, Letter XLVI from Fermat to Frenicle, 1640,\ncited in  stating that, if a is not divisible by a prime p, then Here, as usual, given two integers a and b and a non-zero integer m, we write  (read \"a is congruent to b modulo m\") to mean that m divides a − b, or, what is the same, a and b leave the same residue when divided by m. This notation is actually much later than Fermat's; it first appears in section 1 of Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Fermat's little theorem is a consequence of the fact that the order of an element of a group divides the order of the group. The modern proof would have been within Fermat's means (and was indeed given later by Euler), even though the modern concept of a group came long after Fermat or Euler. (It helps to know that inverses exist modulo p, that is, given a not divisible by a prime p, there is an integer x such that ); this fact (which, in modern language, makes the residues mod p into a group, and which was already known to Āryabhaṭa; see above) was familiar to Fermat thanks to its rediscovery by Bachet . Weil goes on to say that Fermat would have recognised that Bachet's argument is essentially Euclid's algorithm.\n If a and b are coprime, then  is not divisible by any prime congruent to −1 modulo 4;, cited in . All of the following citations from Fermat's Varia Opera are taken from . The standard Tannery & Henry work includes a revision of Fermat's posthumous Varia Opera Mathematica originally prepared by his son . and every prime congruent to 1 modulo 4 can be written in the form . These two statements also date from 1640; in 1659, Fermat stated to Huygens that he had proven the latter statement by the method of infinite descent.\n Fermat posed the problem of solving  as a challenge to English mathematicians (1657). The problem was solved in a few months by Wallis and Brouncker. Fermat considered their solution valid, but pointed out they had provided an algorithm without a proof (as had Jayadeva and Bhaskara, though Fermat would never know this). He states that a proof can be found by descent.\n Fermat states and proves (by descent) in the appendix to Observations on Diophantus (Obs. XLV) that  has no non-trivial solutions in the integers. Fermat also mentioned to his correspondents that  has no non-trivial solutions, and that this could be proven by descent. The first known proof is due to Euler (1753; indeed by descent).\n\nFermat's claim (\"Fermat's last theorem\") to have shown there are no solutions to\n for all  appears only in his annotations on the margin of his copy of Diophantus.\n\nEuler\nthumb|upright|Leonhard Euler\n\nThe interest of Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) in number theory was first spurred in 1729, when a friend of his, the amateurUp to the second half of the seventeenth century, academic positions were very rare, and most mathematicians and scientists earned their living in some other way . (There were already some recognisable features of professional practice, viz., seeking correspondents, visiting foreign colleagues, building private libraries . Matters started to shift in the late 17th century ; scientific academies were founded in England (the Royal Society, 1662) and France (the Académie des sciences, 1666) and Russia (1724). Euler was offered a position at this last one in 1726; he accepted, arriving in St. Petersburg in 1727 ( and\n).\nIn this context, the term amateur usually applied to Goldbach is well-defined and makes some sense: he has been described as a man of letters who earned a living as a spy ; cited in ). Notice, however, that Goldbach published some works on mathematics and sometimes held academic positions. Goldbach, pointed him towards some of Fermat's work on the subject. This has been called the \"rebirth\" of modern number theory, after Fermat's relative lack of success in getting his contemporaries' attention for the subject. and  Euler's work on number theory includes the following: and \n\nProofs for Fermat's statements. This includes Fermat's little theorem (generalised by Euler to non-prime moduli); the fact that  if and only if ; initial work towards a proof that every integer is the sum of four squares (the first complete proof is by Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1770), soon improved by Euler himself); the lack of non-zero integer solutions to  (implying the case n=4 of Fermat's last theorem, the case n=3 of which Euler also proved by a related method).\nPell's equation, first misnamed by Euler.. Euler was generous in giving credit to others , not always correctly. He wrote on the link between continued fractions and Pell's equation.\nFirst steps towards analytic number theory. In his work of sums of four squares, partitions, pentagonal numbers, and the distribution of prime numbers, Euler pioneered the use of what can be seen as analysis (in particular, infinite series) in number theory. Since he lived before the development of complex analysis, most of his work is restricted to the formal manipulation of power series. He did, however, do some very notable (though not fully rigorous) early work on what would later be called the Riemann zeta function.; see also chapter III.\nQuadratic forms. Following Fermat's lead, Euler did further research on the question of which primes can be expressed in the form , some of it prefiguring quadratic reciprocity. \nDiophantine equations. Euler worked on some Diophantine equations of genus 0 and 1. In particular, he studied Diophantus's work; he tried to systematise it, but the time was not yet ripe for such an endeavour—algebraic geometry was still in its infancy. He did notice there was a connection between Diophantine problems and elliptic integrals, whose study he had himself initiated.\n\nLagrange, Legendre, and Gauss\nupright|150px|thumb|Carl Friedrich Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, first edition\n\nJoseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813) was the first to give full proofs of some of Fermat's and Euler's work and observations—for instance, the four-square theorem and the basic theory of the misnamed \"Pell's equation\" (for which an algorithmic solution was found by Fermat and his contemporaries, and also by Jayadeva and Bhaskara II before them.) He also studied quadratic forms in full generality (as opposed to )—defining their equivalence relation, showing how to put them in reduced form, etc.\n\nAdrien-Marie Legendre (1752–1833) was the first to state the law of quadratic reciprocity. He also\nconjectured what amounts to the prime number theorem and Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. He gave a full treatment of the equation  and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss. In his old age, he was the first to prove \"Fermat's last theorem\" for  (completing work by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and crediting both him and Sophie Germain).\n\nthumb|left|Carl Friedrich Gauss\n\nIn his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1798), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) proved the law of quadratic reciprocity and developed the theory of quadratic forms (in particular, defining their composition). He also introduced some basic notation (congruences) and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests. The last section of the Disquisitiones established a link between roots of unity and number theory:\nThe theory of the division of the circle...which is treated in sec. 7 does not belong\nby itself to arithmetic, but its principles can only be drawn from higher arithmetic.From the preface of Disquisitiones Arithmeticae; the translation is taken from \n\nIn this way, Gauss arguably made a first foray towards both Évariste Galois's work and algebraic number theory.\n\nMaturity and division into subfields\nupright|thumb|Ernst Kummer\nupright|left|thumb|Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet\n\nStarting early in the nineteenth century, the following developments gradually took place:\n\n The rise to self-consciousness of number theory (or higher arithmetic) as a field of study.See the discussion in section 5 of . Early signs of self-consciousness are present already in letters by Fermat: thus his remarks on what number theory is, and how \"Diophantus's work [...] does not really belong to [it]\" (quoted in ).\n The development of much of modern mathematics necessary for basic modern number theory: complex analysis, group theory, Galois theory—accompanied by greater rigor in analysis and abstraction in algebra.\n The rough subdivision of number theory into its modern subfields—in particular, analytic and algebraic number theory.\n\nAlgebraic number theory may be said to start with the study of reciprocity and cyclotomy, but truly came into its own with the development of abstract algebra and early ideal theory and valuation theory; see below. A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions (1837),  whose proof introduced L-functions and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable.See the proof in  The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually\ngoes back to Euler (1730s),  who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of complex analysis in number theory comes later: the work of Bernhard Riemann (1859) on the zeta function is the canonical starting point; Jacobi's four-square theorem (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory (modular forms).See the comment on the importance of modularity in \n\nThe history of each subfield is briefly addressed in its own section below; see the main article of each subfield for fuller treatments. Many of the most interesting questions in each area remain open and are being actively worked on.\n\nMain subdivisions\nElementary tools\nThe term elementary generally denotes a method that does not use complex analysis. For example, the prime number theorem was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by Erdős and Selberg. The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex Tauberian theorems (for example, Wiener–Ikehara) are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an elementary proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.\n\nNumber theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.See, for example, the initial comment in .\n\nAnalytic number theory\n\nright|thumb|Riemann zeta function ζ(s) in the complex plane. The color of a point s gives the value of ζ(s): dark colors denote values close to zero and hue gives the value's argument.\nthumb|The action of the modular group on the upper half plane. The region in grey is the standard fundamental domain.\n\nAnalytic number theory may be defined\n\n in terms of its tools, as the study of the integers by means of tools from real and complex analysis; or\n in terms of its concerns, as the study within number theory of estimates on size and density, as opposed to identities.: \"The main difference is that in algebraic number theory [...] one typically considers questions with answers that are given by exact formulas, whereas in analytic number theory [...] one looks for good approximations.\"\n\nSome subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory, for example, sieve theory,Sieve theory figures as one of the main subareas of analytic number theory in many standard treatments; see, for instance,  or  are better covered by the second rather than the first definition: some of sieve theory, for instance, uses little analysis,This is the case for small sieves (in particular, some combinatorial sieves such as the Brun sieve) rather than for large sieves; the study of the latter now includes ideas from harmonic and functional analysis. yet it does belong to analytic number theory.\n\nThe following are examples of problems in analytic number theory: the prime number theorem, the Goldbach conjecture (or the twin prime conjecture, or the Hardy–Littlewood conjectures), the Waring problem and the Riemann hypothesis. Some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the circle method, sieve methods and L-functions (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of modular forms (and, more generally, automorphic forms) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.See the remarks in the introduction to : \"However much stronger...\".\n\nOne may ask analytic questions about algebraic numbers, and use analytic means to answer such questions; it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define prime ideals (generalizations of prime numbers in the field of algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question can be answered by means of an examination of Dedekind zeta functions, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, a key analytic object at the roots of the subject.: \"[Riemann] defined what we now call the Riemann zeta function [...] Riemann's deep work gave birth to our subject [...]\" This is an example of a general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.See, for example, , p. 1.\n\nAlgebraic number theory\n\nAn algebraic number is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation  with rational coefficients; for example, every solution  of  (say) is an algebraic number. Fields of algebraic numbers are also called algebraic number fields, or shortly number fields. Algebraic number theory studies algebraic number fields., p. 2. Thus, analytic and algebraic number theory can and do overlap: the former is defined by its methods, the latter by its objects of study.\n\nIt could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields (viz., quadratic fields) were already studied by Gauss, as the discussion of quadratic forms in Disquisitiones arithmeticae can be restated in terms of ideals and\nnorms in quadratic fields. (A quadratic field consists of all\nnumbers of the form , where\n and  are rational numbers and \nis a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational.)\nFor that matter, the 11th-century chakravala method amounts—in modern terms—to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither Bhāskara nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.\n\nThe grounds of the subject as we know it were set in the late nineteenth century, when ideal numbers, the theory of ideals and valuation theory were developed; these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields. (For example, in the field generated by the rationals\nand , the number  can be factorised both as  and\n; all of , ,  and\n\nare irreducible, and thus, in a naïve sense, analogous to primes among the integers.) The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers (by Kummer) seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws, that is, generalisations of quadratic reciprocity.\n\nNumber fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields: a field L is said to be an extension of a field K if L contains K.\n(For example, the complex numbers C are an extension of the reals R, and the reals R are an extension of the rationals Q.)\nClassifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem. Abelian extensions—that is, extensions L of K such that the Galois groupThe Galois group of an extension K/L consists of the operations (isomorphisms) that send elements of L to other elements of L while leaving all elements of K fixed.\nThus, for instance, Gal(C/R) consists of two elements: the identity element\n(taking every element x + iy of C to itself) and complex conjugation\n(the map taking each element x + iy to x − iy).\nThe Galois group of an extension tells us many of its crucial properties. The study of Galois groups started with Évariste Galois; in modern language, the main outcome of his work is that an equation f(x) = 0 can be solved by radicals\n(that is, x can be expressed in terms of the four basic operations together\nwith square roots, cubic roots, etc.) if and only if the extension of the rationals by the roots of the equation f(x) = 0 has a Galois group that is solvable\nin the sense of group theory. (\"Solvable\", in the sense of group theory, is a simple property that can be checked easily for finite groups.) Gal(L/K) of L over K is an abelian group—are relatively well understood.\nTheir classification was the object of the programme of class field theory, which was initiated in the late 19th century (partly by Kronecker and Eisenstein) and carried out largely in 1900–1950.\n\nAn example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is Iwasawa theory. The Langlands program, one of the main current large-scale research plans in mathematics, is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non-abelian extensions of number fields.\n\nDiophantine geometry\n\nThe central problem of Diophantine geometry is to determine when a Diophantine equation has solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object.\n\nFor example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation, or system of equations, in two or more variables defines a curve, a surface or some other such object in n-dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any rational points (points all of whose coordinates are rationals) or\nintegral points (points all of whose coordinates are integers) on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this direction is: are there finitely\nor infinitely many rational points on a given curve (or surface)? What about integer points?\n\nAn example here may be helpful. Consider the Pythagorean equation ;\nwe would like to study its rational solutions, that is, its solutions\n such that\nx and y are both rational. This is the same as asking for all integer solutions\nto ; any solution to the latter equation gives\nus a solution ,  to the former. It is also the\nsame as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve\ndescribed by . (This curve happens to be a circle of radius 1 around the origin.)\n\nright|thumb|300px|Two examples of an elliptic curve, that is, a curve\nof genus 1 having at least one rational point. (Either graph can be seen as a slice of a torus in four-dimensional space.)\n\nThe rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves turns out to be felicitous. The finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve—that is, rational or integer solutions to an equation , where  is a polynomial in two variables—turns out to depend crucially on the genus of the curve. The genus can be defined as follows:It may be useful to look at an example here. Say we want to study the curve . We allow x and y to be complex numbers: . This is, in effect, a set of two equations on four variables, since both the real\nand the imaginary part on each side must match. As a result, we get a surface (two-dimensional) in four-dimensional space. After we choose a convenient hyperplane on which to project the surface (meaning that, say, we choose to ignore the coordinate a), we can\nplot the resulting projection, which is a surface in ordinary three-dimensional space. It\nthen becomes clear that the result is a torus, loosely speaking, the surface of a doughnut (somewhat\nstretched). A doughnut has one hole; hence the genus is 1. allow the variables in  to be complex numbers; then  defines a 2-dimensional surface in (projective) 4-dimensional space (since two complex variables can be decomposed into four real variables, that is, four dimensions). Count\nthe number of (doughnut) holes in the surface; call this number the genus of . Other geometrical notions turn out to be just as crucial.\n\nThere is also the closely linked area of Diophantine approximations: given a number , how well can it be approximated by rationals? (We are looking for approximations that are good relative to the amount of space that it takes to write the rational: call  (with ) a good approximation to  if , where  is large.) This question is of special interest if  is an algebraic number. If  cannot be well approximated, then some equations do not have integer or rational solutions. Moreover, several concepts (especially that of height) turn out to be crucial both in Diophantine geometry and in the study of Diophantine approximations. This question is also of special interest in transcendental number theory: if a number can be better approximated than any algebraic number, then it is a transcendental number. It is by this argument that  and e have been shown to be transcendental.\n\nDiophantine geometry should not be confused with the geometry of numbers, which is a collection of graphical methods for answering certain questions in algebraic number theory. Arithmetic geometry, on the other hand, is a contemporary term\nfor much the same domain as that covered by the term Diophantine geometry. The term arithmetic geometry is arguably used\nmost often when one wishes to emphasise the connections to modern algebraic geometry (as in, for instance, Faltings's theorem) rather than to techniques in Diophantine approximations.\n\nOther subfields\nThe areas below date from no earlier than the mid-twentieth century, even if they are based on older material. For example, as is explained below, the matter of algorithms in number theory is very old, in some sense older than the concept of proof; at the same time, the modern study of computability dates only from the 1930s and 1940s, and computational complexity theory from the 1970s.\n\nProbabilistic number theory\n\nTake a number at random between one and a million. How likely is it to be prime? This is just another way of asking how many primes there are between one and a million. Further: how many prime divisors will it have, on average? How many divisors will it have altogether, and with what likelihood? What is the probability that it will have many more or many fewer divisors or prime divisors than the average?\n\nMuch of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of variables that are almost, but not quite, mutually independent. For example, the event that a random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be divisible by three are almost independent, but not quite.\n\nIt is sometimes said that probabilistic combinatorics uses the fact that whatever happens with probability greater than  must happen sometimes; one may say with equal justice that many applications of probabilistic number theory hinge on the fact that whatever is unusual must be rare. If certain algebraic objects (say, rational or integer solutions to certain equations) can be shown to be in the tail of certain sensibly defined distributions, it follows that there must be few of them; this is a very concrete non-probabilistic statement following from a probabilistic one.\n\nAt times, a non-rigorous, probabilistic approach leads to a number of heuristic algorithms and open problems, notably Cramér's conjecture.\n\nArithmetic combinatorics\n\nLet A be a set of N integers. Consider the set A + A = { m + n | m, n ∈ A } consisting of all sums of two elements of A. Is A + A much larger than A? Barely larger? If A + A is barely larger than A, must A have plenty of arithmetic structure, for example, does A resemble an arithmetic progression?\n\nIf we begin from a fairly \"thick\" infinite set , does it contain many elements in arithmetic progression: ,\n, say? Should it be possible to write large integers as sums of elements of ?\n\nThese questions are characteristic of arithmetic combinatorics. This is a presently coalescing field; it subsumes additive number theory (which concerns itself with certain very specific sets  of arithmetic significance, such as the primes or the squares) and, arguably, some of the geometry of numbers,\ntogether with some rapidly developing new material. Its focus on issues of growth and distribution accounts in part for its developing links with ergodic theory, finite group theory, model theory, and other fields. The term additive combinatorics is also used; however, the sets  being studied need not be sets of integers, but rather subsets of non-commutative groups, for which the multiplication symbol, not the addition symbol, is traditionally used; they can also be subsets of rings, in which case the growth of  and · may be\ncompared.\n\nComputational number theory\nthumb|A Lehmer sieve, which is a primitive digital computer once used for finding primes and solving simple Diophantine equations.While the word algorithm goes back only to certain readers of al-Khwārizmī, careful descriptions of methods of solution are older than proofs: such methods (that is, algorithms) are as old as any recognisable mathematics—ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Vedic, Chinese—whereas proofs appeared only with the Greeks of the classical period.\nAn interesting early case is that of what we now call the Euclidean algorithm. In its basic form (namely, as an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor) it appears as Proposition 2 of Book VII in Elements, together with a proof of correctness. However, in the form that is often used in number theory (namely, as an algorithm for finding integer solutions to an equation ,\nor, what is the same, for finding the quantities whose existence is assured by the Chinese remainder theorem) it first appears in the works of Āryabhaṭa (5th–6th century CE) as an algorithm called\nkuṭṭaka (\"pulveriser\"), without a proof of correctness.\n\nThere are two main questions: \"can we compute this?\" and \"can we compute it rapidly?\". Anyone can test whether a number is prime or, if it is not, split it into prime factors; doing so rapidly is another matter. We now know fast algorithms for testing primality, but, in spite of much work (both theoretical and practical), no truly fast algorithm for factoring.\n\nThe difficulty of a computation can be useful: modern protocols for encrypting messages (for example, RSA) depend on functions that are known to all, but whose inverses (a) are known only to a chosen few, and (b) would take one too long a time to figure out on one's own. For example, these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized. While many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known, most working encryption protocols nowadays are based on the difficulty of a few number-theoretical problems.\n\nOn a different note—some things may not be computable at all; in fact, this can be proven in some instances. For instance, in 1970, it was proven, as a solution to Hilbert's 10th problem, that there is no Turing machine which can solve all Diophantine equations. Reprinted in The Collected Works of Julia Robinson, Solomon Feferman, editor, pp. 269–378, American Mathematical Society 1996. In particular, this means that, given a computably enumerable set of axioms, there are Diophantine equations for which there is no proof, starting from the axioms, of whether the set of equations has or does not have integer solutions. (We would necessarily be speaking of Diophantine equations for which there are no integer solutions, since, given a Diophantine equation with at least one solution, the solution itself provides a proof of the fact that a solution exists. We cannot prove, of course, that a particular Diophantine equation is of this kind, since this would imply that it has no solutions.)\n\nApplications\n\nThe number-theorist Leonard Dickson (1874–1954) said \"Thank God that number theory is unsullied by any application\". Such a view is no longer applicable to number theory.\"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Number Theory\", Stefan Andrus Burr, George E.

      "text": "In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and the derivatives of those functions. The term ordinary is used in contrast with the term partial differential equation which may be with respect to more than one independent variable.\n\n Differential equations \nA linear differential equation is a differential equation that is defined by a linear polynomial in the unknown function and its derivatives, that is an equation of the form \n\nwhere , ...,  and  are arbitrary differentiable functions that do not need to be linear, and   are the successive derivatives of the unknown function  of the variable .\n\nAmong ordinary differential equations, linear differential equations play a prominent role for several reasons. Most elementary and special functions that are encountered in physics and applied mathematics are solutions of linear differential equations (see Holonomic function). When physical phenomena are modeled with non-linear equations, they are generally approximated by linear differential equations for an easier solution. The few non-linear ODEs that can be solved explicitly are generally solved by transforming the equation into an equivalent linear ODE (see, for example Riccati equation).\n\nSome ODEs can be solved explicitly in terms of known functions and integrals. When that is not possible, the equation for computing the Taylor series of the solutions may be useful. For applied problems, numerical methods for ordinary differential equations can supply an approximation of the solution.\n\nBackground\nright|thumb|250px|alt=parabolic projectile motion showing velocity vector|The trajectory of a projectile launched from a cannon follows a curve determined by an ordinary differential equation that is derived from Newton's second law.\n\nOrdinary differential equations (ODEs) arise in many contexts of mathematics and social and natural sciences. Mathematical descriptions of change use differentials and derivatives. Various differentials, derivatives, and functions become related via equations, such that a differential equation is a result that describes dynamically changing phenomena, evolution, and variation. Often, quantities are defined as the rate of change of other quantities (for example, derivatives of displacement with respect to time), or gradients of quantities, which is how they enter differential equations.\n\nSpecific mathematical fields include geometry and analytical mechanics. Scientific fields include much of physics and astronomy (celestial mechanics), meteorology (weather modelling), chemistry (reaction rates),Mathematics for Chemists, D.M. Hirst, Macmillan Press, 1976, (No ISBN) SBN: 333-18172-7 biology (infectious diseases, genetic variation), ecology and population modelling (population competition), economics (stock trends, interest rates and the market equilibrium price changes).\n\nMany mathematicians have studied differential equations and contributed to the field, including Newton, Leibniz, the Bernoulli family, Riccati,  Clairaut, d'Alembert, and Euler.\n\nA simple example is Newton's second law of motion — the relationship between the displacement x and the time t of an object under the force F, is given by the differential equation\n\nwhich constrains the motion of a particle of constant mass m. In general, F is a function of the position x(t) of the particle at time t. The unknown function x(t) appears on both sides of the differential equation, and is indicated in the notation F(x(t)).\n\nDefinitions\nIn what follows, let y be a dependent variable and x an independent variable, and y = f(x) is an unknown function of x. The notation for differentiation varies depending upon the author and upon which notation is most useful for the task at hand. In this context, the Leibniz's notation (dy/dx,d2y/dx2,...,dny/dxn) is more useful for differentiation and integration, whereas Lagrange's notation (y′,y′′, ..., y(n)) is more useful for representing derivatives of any order compactly, and Newton's notation  is often used in physics for representing derivatives of low order with respect to time.\n\nGeneral definition\nGiven F, a function of x, y, and derivatives of y. Then an equation of the form\n\nis called an explicit ordinary differential equation of order n.\n\nMore generally, an implicit ordinary differential equation of order n takes the form:\n\nThere are further classifications:\n\nSystem of ODEs\nA number of coupled differential equations form a system of equations. If y is a vector whose elements are functions; y(x) = [y1(x), y2(x),..., ym(x)], and F is a vector-valued function of y and its derivatives, then\n\nis an explicit system of ordinary differential equations of order n and dimension m. In column vector form:\n\nThese are not necessarily linear. The implicit analogue is:\n\nwhere 0 = (0, 0, ..., 0) is the zero vector. In matrix form\n\nFor a system of the form , some sources also require that the Jacobian matrix  be non-singular in order to call this an implicit ODE [system]; an implicit ODE system satisfying this Jacobian non-singularity condition can be transformed into an explicit ODE system. In the same sources, implicit ODE systems with a singular Jacobian are termed differential algebraic equations (DAEs). This distinction is not merely one of terminology; DAEs have fundamentally different characteristics and are generally more involved to solve than (nonsingular) ODE systems. Presumably for additional derivatives, the Hessian matrix and so forth are also assumed non-singular according to this scheme,  although note that any ODE of order greater than one can be [and usually is] rewritten as system of ODEs of first order, which makes the Jacobian singularity criterion sufficient for this taxonomy to be comprehensive at all orders.\n\nThe behavior of a system of ODEs can be visualized through the use of a phase portrait.\n\n Solutions \nGiven a differential equation\n\na function  is called a solution or integral curve for F, if u is n-times differentiable on I, and\n\nGiven two solutions  and , u is called an extension of v if  and\n\nA solution that has no extension is called a maximal solution. A solution defined on all of R is called a global solution.\n\nA general solution of an nth-order equation is a solution containing n arbitrary independent constants of integration.  A particular solution is derived from the general solution by setting the constants to particular values, often chosen to fulfill set 'initial conditions or boundary conditions'.  A singular solution is a solution that cannot be obtained by assigning definite values to the arbitrary constants in the general solution.\n\nTheories\n\nSingular solutions\nThe theory of singular solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations was a subject of research from the time of Leibniz, but only since the middle of the nineteenth century has it received special attention. A valuable but little-known work on the subject is that of Houtain (1854). Darboux (from 1873) was a leader in the theory, and in the geometric interpretation of these solutions he opened a field worked by various writers, notably Casorati and Cayley. To the latter is due (1872) the theory of singular solutions of differential equations of the first order as accepted circa 1900.\n\nReduction to quadratures\nThe primitive attempt in dealing with differential equations had in view a reduction to quadratures. As it had been the hope of eighteenth-century algebraists to find a method for solving the general equation of the nth degree, so it was the hope of analysts to find a general method for integrating any differential equation. Gauss (1799) showed, however, that complex differential equations require complex numbers. Hence, analysts began to substitute the study of functions, thus opening a new and fertile field. Cauchy was the first to appreciate the importance of this view.  Thereafter, the real question was no longer whether a solution is possible by means of known functions or their integrals, but whether a given differential equation suffices for the definition of a function of the independent variable or variables, and, if so, what are the characteristic properties.\n\nFuchsian theory\n\nTwo memoirs by FuchsCrelle, 1866, 1868 inspired a novel approach, subsequently elaborated by Thomé and Frobenius. Collet was a prominent contributor beginning in 1869. His method for integrating a non-linear system was communicated to Bertrand in 1868. Clebsch (1873) attacked the theory along lines parallel to those in his theory of Abelian integrals. As the latter can be classified according to the properties of the fundamental curve that remains unchanged under a rational transformation, Clebsch proposed to classify the transcendent functions defined by differential equations according to the invariant properties of the corresponding surfaces f = 0 under rational one-to-one transformations.\n\nLie's theory\nFrom 1870, Sophus Lie's work put the theory of differential equations on a better foundation. He showed that the integration theories of the older mathematicians can, using Lie groups, be referred to a common source, and that ordinary differential equations that admit the same infinitesimal transformations present comparable integration difficulties. He also emphasized the subject of transformations of contact.\n\nLie's group theory of differential equations has been certified, namely: (1) that it unifies the many ad hoc methods known for solving differential equations, and (2) that it provides powerful new ways to find solutions. The theory has applications to both ordinary and partial differential equations.\n\nA general solution approach uses the symmetry property of differential equations, the continuous infinitesimal transformations of solutions to solutions (Lie theory). Continuous group theory, Lie algebras, and differential geometry are used to understand the structure of linear and nonlinear (partial) differential equations for generating integrable equations, to find its Lax pairs, recursion operators, Bäcklund transform, and finally finding exact analytic solutions to DE.\n\nSymmetry methods have been applied to differential equations that arise in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other disciplines.\n\n Sturm–Liouville theory \n\nSturm–Liouville theory is a theory of a special type of second order linear ordinary differential equation. Their solutions are based on eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of linear operators defined via second-order homogeneous linear equations. The problems are identified as Sturm-Liouville Problems (SLP) and are named after J.C.F. Sturm and J. Liouville, who studied them in the mid-1800s. SLPs have an infinite number of eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenfunctions form a complete, orthogonal set, which makes orthogonal expansions possible. This is a key idea in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering.Logan, J. (2013). Applied mathematics (Fourth ed.). SLPs are also useful in the analysis of certain partial differential equations.\n\nExistence and uniqueness of solutions\n\nThere are several theorems that establish existence and uniqueness of solutions to initial value problems involving ODEs both locally and globally. The two main theorems are\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Theorem\n! Assumption\n! Conclusion\n|-\n|Peano existence theorem\n||F continuous\n||local existence only\n|-\n|Picard–Lindelöf theorem\n||F Lipschitz continuous\n||local existence and uniqueness\n|-\n|}\n\nIn their basic form both of these theorems only guarantee local results, though the latter can be extended to give a global result, for example, if the conditions of Grönwall's inequality are met.\n\nAlso, uniqueness theorems like the Lipschitz one above do not apply to DAE systems, which may have multiple solutions stemming from their (non-linear) algebraic part alone.\n\nLocal existence and uniqueness theorem simplified\n\nThe theorem can be stated simply as follows.Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems (4th Edition), W.E. Boyce, R.C. Diprima, Wiley International, John Wiley & Sons, 1986,  For the equation and initial value problem:\n\nif F and ∂F/∂y are continuous in a closed rectangle\n\nin the x-y plane, where a and b are real (symbolically: a, b ∈ ℝ) and × denotes the cartesian product, square brackets denote closed intervals, then there is an interval\n\nfor some h ∈ ℝ where the solution to the above equation and initial value problem can be found. That is, there is a solution and it is unique. Since there is no restriction on F to be linear, this applies to non-linear equations that take the form F(x, y), and it can also be applied to systems of equations.\n\nGlobal uniqueness and maximum domain of solution\nWhen the hypotheses of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem are satisfied, then local existence and uniqueness can be extended to a global result. More precisely:Boscain; Chitour 2011, p. 21\n\nFor each initial condition (x0, y0) there exists a unique maximum (possibly infinite) open interval\n\nsuch that any solution that satisfies this initial condition is a restriction of the solution that satisfies this initial condition with domain .\n\nIn the case that , there are exactly two possibilities\n\nexplosion in finite time: \nleaves domain of definition: \n\nwhere Ω is the open set in which F is defined, and  is its boundary.\n\nNote that the maximum domain of the solution\n\n is always an interval (to have uniqueness)\n may be smaller than \n may depend on the specific choice of (x0, y0).\n\nExample.\n\nThis means that F(x, y) = y2, which is C1 and therefore locally Lipschitz continuous, satisfying the Picard–Lindelöf theorem.\n\nEven in such a simple setting, the maximum domain of solution cannot be all  since the solution is\n\nwhich has maximum domain:\n\nThis shows clearly that the maximum interval may depend on the initial conditions.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-intuitionism",
      "text": "In the mathematical philosophy, the pre-intuitionists were a small but influential group who informally shared similar philosophies on the nature of mathematics. The term itself was used by L. E. J. Brouwer, who in his 1951 lectures at Cambridge described the differences between intuitionism and its predecessors:Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer (edited by Arend Heyting, Collected Works, North-Holland, 1975, p. 509.\n\nOf a totally different orientation [from the \"Old Formalist School\" of Dedekind, Cantor, Peano,  Zermelo, and Couturat, etc.] was the Pre-Intuitionist School, mainly led by Poincaré, Borel and Lebesgue. These thinkers seem to have maintained a modified observational standpoint for the introduction of natural numbers, for the principle of complete induction [...] For these, even for such theorems as were deduced by means of classical logic, they postulated an existence and exactness independent of language and logic and regarded its non-contradictority as certain, even without logical proof. For the continuum, however, they seem not to have sought an origin strictly extraneous to language and logic.\n\nThe introduction of natural numbers\n\nThe pre-intuitionists, as defined by Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer, differed from the formalist standpoint in several ways, particularly in regard to the introduction of natural numbers, or how the natural numbers are defined/denoted. For Poincaré, the definition of a mathematical entity is the construction of the entity itself and not an expression of an underlying essence or existence.\n\nThis is to say that no mathematical object exists without human construction of it, both in mind and language.\n\nThe principle of complete induction\nThis sense of definition allowed Poincaré to argue with Bertrand Russell over  Giuseppe Peano's axiomatic theory of natural numbers.\n\nPeano's fifth axiom states: \nAllow that; zero has a property P; \nAnd; if every natural number less than a number x has the property P then x also has the property P. \nTherefore; every natural number has the property P.\n\nThis is the principle of complete induction, which establishes the property of induction as necessary to the system. Since Peano's axiom is as infinite as the natural numbers, it is difficult to prove that the property of P does belong to any x and also x + 1. What one can do is say that, if after some number n of trials that show a property P conserved in x and x + 1, then we may infer that it will still hold to be true after n + 1 trials. But this is itself induction. And hence the argument is a vicious circle.\n\nFrom this Poincaré argues that if we fail to establish the consistency of Peano's axioms for natural numbers without falling into circularity, then the principle of complete induction is not provable by general logic.\n\nThus arithmetic and mathematics in general is not analytic but synthetic. Logicism thus rebuked and Intuition is held up. What Poincaré and the Pre-Intuitionists shared was the perception of a difference between logic and mathematics that is not a matter of language alone, but of knowledge itself.\n\nArguments over the excluded middle\nIt was for this assertion, among others, that Poincaré was considered to be similar to the intuitionists. For Brouwer though, the Pre-Intuitionists failed to go as far as necessary in divesting mathematics from metaphysics, for they still used principium tertii exclusi (the \"law of excluded middle\").\n\nThe principle of the excluded middle does lead to some strange situations. For instance, statements about the future such as \"There will be a naval battle tomorrow\" do not seem to be either true or false, yet. So there is some question whether statements must be either true or false in some situations. To an intuitionist this seems to rank the law of excluded middle as just as unrigorous as Peano's vicious circle.\n\nYet to the Pre-Intuitionists this is mixing apples and oranges. For them mathematics was one thing (a muddled invention of the human mind, i.e., synthetic), and logic was another (analytic).\n\nOther pre-intuitionists\nThe above examples only include the works of Poincaré, and yet Brouwer named other mathematicians as Pre-Intuitionists too; Borel and Lebesgue. Other mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl (who eventually became disenchanted with intuitionism, feeling that it places excessive strictures on mathematical progress) and Leopold Kronecker also played a role—though they are not cited by Brouwer in his definitive speech.\n\nIn fact Kronecker might be the most famous of the Pre-Intuitionists for his singular and oft quoted phrase, \"God made the natural numbers; all else is the work of man.\"\n\nKronecker  goes in almost the opposite direction from Poincaré, believing in the natural numbers but not the law of the excluded middle. He was the first mathematician to express doubt on non-constructive existence proofs that state that something must exist because it can be shown that it is \"impossible\" for it not to.\n\n See also \n Conventionalism\n\n References \n\nLogical Meanderings – a brief article by Jan Sraathof on Brouwer's various attacks on arguments of the Pre-Intuitionists about the Principle of the Excluded Third.\nProof And Intuition – an article on the many varieties of knowledge as they relate to the Intuitionist and Logicist.\nBrouwer's Cambridge Lectures on Intuitionism – wherein Brouwer talks about the Pre-Intuitionist School and addresses what he sees as its many shortcomings.\n\nCategory:Theories of deduction\nCategory:History of mathematics"

The point is to capture the notion of a proof predicate of a reasonably rich formal theory, such as Peano arithmetic. \n\nExamples\nThere are a number of provability logics, some of which are covered in the literature mentioned in the References section. The basic system is generally referred to as GL (for Gödel-Löb) or L or K4W.

      "text": "Raphael Mitchel Robinson (November 2, 1911 – January 27, 1995) was an American mathematician.\n\nBorn in National City, California, Robinson was the youngest of four children of a lawyer and a teacher. He was awarded from the University of California, Berkeley in mathematics: the BA (1932), MA (1933), and Ph.D. (1935). His Ph.D. thesis, on complex analysis, was titled Some results in the theory of Schlicht functions.\n\nIn 1941, Robinson married his former student Julia Bowman. She became his Berkeley colleague and the first woman president of the American Mathematical Society.\n\nRobinson worked on mathematical logic, set theory, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics. In 1937 he set out a simpler and more conventional version of the John von Neumann 1923 axiomatic set theory. Soon after Alfred Tarski joined Berkeley's mathematics department in 1942, Robinson began to do major work on the foundations of mathematics, building on Tarski's concept of \"essential undecidability,\" by proving a number of mathematical theories undecidable. In 1950 Robinson proved that an essentially undecidable theory need not have an infinite number of axioms by coming up with a counterexample: Robinson arithmetic Q. Q is finitely axiomatizable because it lacks Peano arithmetic's axiom schema of induction; nevertheless Q, like Peano arithmetic, is incomplete and undecidable in the sense of Gödel. Robinson's work on undecidability culminated in his coauthoring Tarski et al. (1953), which established, among other things, the undecidability of group theory, lattice theory, abstract projective geometry, and closure algebras.\n\nRobinson worked in number theory, even employing very early computers to obtain results. For example, he coded the Lucas-Lehmer primality test to determine whether 2n − 1 was prime for all prime n < 2304 on a SWAC. In 1952, he showed that these Mersenne numbers were all composite except for 17 values of n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281. He discovered the last five of these Mersenne primes, the largest ones known at the time.\n\nRobinson wrote several papers on tilings of the plane, in particular a clear and remarkable 1971 paper Undecidability and nonperiodicity for tilings of the plane simplifying what had been a tangled theory.\n\nRobinson became a full professor at Berkeley in 1949, retired in 1973, and remained active in his educational interests for the duration of his life having published late in his life:\n (age 80 years)  Minsky's small universal Turing machine, describing a universal Turing machine with four symbols and seven states;\n (age 83 years) Two figures in the hyperbolic plane.\n\nSee also\n\nRobinson arithmetic\n\nReferences\n .\n .\n Alfred Tarski, A.

      "title": "Reverse mathematics",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics",
      "text": "Reverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics.  Its defining method can briefly be described as \"going backwards from the theorems to the axioms\", in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms. It can be conceptualized as sculpting out necessary conditions from sufficient ones.\n\nThe reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and Zorn's lemma are equivalent over ZF set theory. The goal of reverse mathematics, however, is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory.\n\nReverse mathematics is usually carried out using subsystems of second-order arithmetic, where many of its definitions and methods are inspired by previous work in constructive analysis and proof theory. The use of second-order arithmetic also allows many techniques from recursion theory to be employed; many results in reverse mathematics have corresponding results in computable analysis.  Recently, higher-order reverse mathematics has been introduced, in which the focus is on subsystems of higher-order arithmetic, and the associated richer language. \n\nThe program was founded by  and brought forward by Steve Simpson.  A standard reference for the subject is , while an introduction for non-specialists is .  An introduction to higher-order reverse mathematics, and also the founding paper, is ().\n\n General principles \nIn reverse mathematics, one starts with a framework language and a base theory—a core axiom system—that is too weak to prove most of the theorems one might be interested in, but still powerful enough to develop the definitions necessary to state these theorems.  For example, to study the theorem “Every bounded sequence of real numbers has a supremum” it is necessary to use a base system which can speak of real numbers and sequences of real numbers.\n\nFor each theorem that can be stated in the base system but is not provable in the base system, the goal is to determine the particular axiom system (stronger than the base system) that is necessary to prove that theorem. To show that a system S is required to prove a theorem T, two proofs are required. The first proof shows T is provable from S; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system S. The second proof, known as a reversal, shows that T itself implies S; this proof is carried out in the base system. The reversal establishes that no axiom system S′ that extends the base system can be weaker than S while still proving T.\n\n Use of second-order arithmetic \n\nMost reverse mathematics research focuses on subsystems of second-order arithmetic. The body of research in reverse mathematics has established that weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic suffice to formalize almost all undergraduate-level mathematics. In second-order arithmetic, all objects can be represented as either natural numbers or sets of natural numbers.  For example, in order to prove theorems about real numbers, the real numbers can be represented as Cauchy sequences of rational numbers, each of which can be represented as a set of natural numbers.\n\nThe axiom systems most often considered in reverse mathematics are defined using axiom schemes called comprehension schemes.  Such a scheme states that any set of natural numbers definable by a formula of a given complexity exists. In this context, the complexity of formulas is measured using the arithmetical hierarchy and analytical hierarchy.\n\nThe reason that reverse mathematics is not carried out using set theory as a base system is that the language of set theory is too expressive.  Extremely complex sets of natural numbers can be defined by simple formulas in the language of set theory (which can quantify over arbitrary sets). In the context of second-order arithmetic, results such as Post's theorem establish a close link between the complexity of a formula and the (non)computability of the set it defines.\n\nAnother effect of using second-order arithmetic is the need to restrict general mathematical theorems to forms that can be expressed within arithmetic. For example, second-order arithmetic can express the principle \"Every countable vector space has a basis\" but it cannot express the principle \"Every vector space has a basis\". In practical terms, this means that theorems of algebra and combinatorics are restricted to countable structures, while theorems of analysis and topology are restricted to separable spaces. Many principles that imply the axiom of choice in their general form (such as \"Every vector space has a basis\") become provable in weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic when they are restricted. For example, \"every field has an algebraic closure\" is not provable in ZF set theory, but the restricted form \"every countable field has an algebraic closure\" is provable in RCA0, the weakest system typically employed in reverse mathematics.\n\n Use of higher-order arithmetic \n\nA recent strand of higher-order reverse mathematics research, initiated by Ulrich Kohlenbach, focuses on subsystems of higher-order arithmetic (). \nDue to the richer language of higher-order arithmetic, the use of representations (aka 'codes') common in second-order arithmetic, is greatly reduced.  \nFor example, a continuous function on the Cantor space is just a function that maps binary sequences to binary sequences, and that also satisfies the usual 'epsilon-delta'-definition of continuity. \n\nHigher-order reverse mathematics includes higher-order versions of (second-order) comprehension schemes.  Such an higher-order axiom states the existence of a functional that decides the truth or falsity of formulas of a given complexity. In this context, the complexity of formulas is also measured using the arithmetical hierarchy and analytical hierarchy.  The higher-order counterparts of the major subsystems of second-order arithmetic generally prove the same second-order sentences (or a large subset) as the original second-order systems (see  and ).  For instance, the base theory of higher-order reverse mathematics, called , proves the same sentences as RCA0, up to language.  \n\nAs noted in the previous paragraph, second-order comprehension axioms easily generalize to the higher-order framework.  However, theorems expressing the compactness of basic spaces behave quite differently in second- and higher-order arithmetic: on one hand, when restricted to countable covers/the language of second-order arithmetic, the compactness of the unit interval is provable in WKL0 from the next section.  On the other hand, given uncountable covers/the language of higher-order arithmetic, the compactness of the unit interval is only provable from (full) second-order arithmetic ().  Other covering lemmas (e.g. due to Lindelöf, Vitali, Besicovitch, etc) exhibit the same behavior, and many basic properties of the gauge integral are equivalent to the compactness of the underlying space.\n\n The big five subsystems of second-order arithmetic \n\nSecond-order arithmetic is a formal theory of the natural numbers and sets of natural numbers.  Many mathematical objects, such as countable rings, groups, and fields, as well as points in effective Polish spaces, can be represented as sets of natural numbers, and modulo this representation can be studied in second-order arithmetic.\n\nReverse mathematics makes use of several subsystems of second-order arithmetic. A typical reverse mathematics theorem shows that a particular mathematical theorem T is equivalent to a particular subsystem S of second-order arithmetic over a weaker subsystem B. This weaker system B is known as the base system for the result; in order for the reverse mathematics result to have\nmeaning, this system must not itself be able to prove the mathematical theorem T.\n\n describes five particular subsystems of second-order arithmetic, which he calls the Big Five, that occur frequently in reverse mathematics. In order of increasing strength, these systems are named by the initialisms RCA0, WKL0, ACA0, ATR0, and Π-CA0.\n\nThe following table summarizes the \"big five\" systems () and lists the counterpart systems in higher-order arithmetic ().  \nThe latter generally prove the same second-order sentences (or a large subset) as the original second-order systems (see  and ).\nSubsystemStands forOrdinalCorresponds roughly toCommentsHigher-order counterpartRCA0Recursive comprehension axiomωωConstructive mathematics (Bishop)The base theory RCA; proves the same second-order sentences as RCA0WKL0Weak Kőnig's lemmaωωFinitistic reductionism (Hilbert) Conservative over PRA (resp.

Π-CA0Π comprehension axiomΨ0(Ωω)Impredicativism The Suslin functional  decides -formulas (restricted to second-order parameters).  \n\nThe subscript 0 in these names means that the induction scheme has been restricted from the full second-order induction scheme . For example, ACA0 includes the induction axiom . This together with the full comprehension axiom of second-order arithmetic  implies the full second-order induction scheme given by the universal closure of (φ(0) ∧ ∀n(φ(n) → φ(n+1))) → ∀n φ(n) for any second-order formula φ. However ACA0 does not have the full comprehension axiom, and the subscript 0 is a reminder that it does not have the full second-order induction scheme either.  This restriction is important: systems with restricted induction have significantly lower proof-theoretical ordinals than systems with the full second-order induction scheme.\n\n The base system RCA0\n\nRCA0 is the fragment of second-order arithmetic whose axioms are the axioms of Robinson arithmetic, induction for Σ formulas, and comprehension for Δ formulas.\n\nThe subsystem RCA0 is the one most commonly used as a base system for reverse mathematics. The initials \"RCA\" stand for \"recursive comprehension axiom\", where \"recursive\" means \"computable\", as in recursive function.  This name is used because RCA0 corresponds informally to \"computable mathematics\". In particular, any set of natural numbers that can be proven to exist in RCA0 is computable, and thus any theorem which implies that noncomputable sets exist is not provable in RCA0. To this extent, RCA0 is a constructive system, although it does not meet the requirements of the program of constructivism because it is a theory in classical logic including the law of excluded middle.\n\nDespite its seeming weakness (of not proving any non-computable sets exist), RCA0 is sufficient to prove a number of classical theorems which, therefore, require only minimal logical strength. These theorems are, in a sense, below the reach of the reverse mathematics enterprise because they are already provable in the base system. The classical theorems provable in RCA0 include:\n Basic properties of the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers (for example, that the latter form an ordered field).\n Basic properties of the real numbers (the real numbers are an Archimedean ordered field; any nested sequence of closed intervals whose lengths tend to zero has a single point in its intersection; the real numbers are not countable).\n The Baire category theorem for a complete separable metric space (the separability condition is necessary to even state the theorem in the language of second-order arithmetic).\n The intermediate value theorem on continuous real functions.\n The Banach–Steinhaus theorem for a sequence of continuous linear operators on separable Banach spaces.\n A weak version of Gödel's completeness theorem (for a set of sentences, in a countable language, that is already closed under consequence).\n The existence of an algebraic closure for a countable field (but not its uniqueness).\n The existence and uniqueness of the real closure of a countable ordered field.\n\nThe first-order part of RCA0 (the theorems of the system that do not involve any set variables) is the set of theorems of first-order Peano arithmetic with induction limited to Σ formulas.  It is provably consistent, as is RCA0, in full first-order Peano arithmetic.\n\n Weak Kőnig's lemma WKL0\n\nThe subsystem WKL0 consists of RCA0 plus a weak form of Kőnig's lemma, namely the statement that every infinite subtree of the full binary tree (the tree of all finite sequences of 0's and 1's) has an infinite path. This proposition, which is known as weak Kőnig's lemma, is easy to state in the language of second-order arithmetic. WKL0 can also be defined as the principle of Σ separation (given two Σ formulas of a free variable n which are exclusive, there is a class containing all n satisfying the one and no n satisfying the other).\n\nThe following remark on terminology is in order.  The term “weak Kőnig's lemma” refers to the sentence which says that any infinite subtree of the binary tree has an infinite path.  When this axiom is added to RCA0, the resulting subsystem is called WKL0. A similar distinction between particular axioms, on the one hand, and subsystems including the basic axioms and induction, on the other hand, is made for the stronger subsystems described below.\n\nIn a sense, weak Kőnig's lemma is a form of the axiom of choice (although, as stated, it can be proven in classical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice).  It is not constructively valid in some senses of the word constructive.\n\nTo show that WKL0 is actually stronger than (not provable in) RCA0, it is sufficient to exhibit a theorem of WKL0 which implies that noncomputable sets exist. This is not difficult; WKL0 implies the existence of separating sets for effectively inseparable recursively enumerable sets.\n\nIt turns out that RCA0 and WKL0 have the same first-order part, meaning that they prove the same first-order sentences.  WKL0 can prove a good number of classical mathematical results which do not follow from RCA0, however.  These results are not expressible as first-order statements but can be expressed as second-order statements.\n\nThe following results are equivalent to weak Kőnig's lemma and thus to WKL0 over RCA0:\n\n The Heine–Borel theorem for the closed unit real interval, in the following sense: every covering by a sequence of open intervals has a finite subcovering.\n The Heine–Borel theorem for complete totally bounded separable metric spaces (where covering is by a sequence of open balls).\n A continuous real function on the closed unit interval (or on any compact separable metric space, as above) is bounded (or: bounded and reaches its bounds).\n A continuous real function on the closed unit interval can be uniformly approximated by polynomials (with rational coefficients).\n A continuous real function on the closed unit interval is uniformly continuous.\n A continuous real function on the closed unit interval is Riemann integrable.\n The Brouwer fixed point theorem (for continuous functions on a finite product of copies of the closed unit interval).\n The separable Hahn–Banach theorem in the form: a bounded linear form on a subspace of a separable Banach space extends to a bounded linear form on the whole space.\n The Jordan curve theorem\n Gödel's completeness theorem (for a countable language).\n Determinacy for open (or even clopen) games on {0,1} of length ω.\n Every countable commutative ring has a prime ideal.\n Every countable formally real field is orderable.\n Uniqueness of algebraic closure (for a countable field).\n\n Arithmetical comprehension ACA0\n\nACA0 is RCA0 plus the comprehension scheme for arithmetical formulas (which is sometimes called the \"arithmetical comprehension axiom\"). That is, ACA0 allows us to form the set of natural numbers satisfying an arbitrary arithmetical formula (one with no bound set variables, although possibly containing set parameters). Actually, it suffices to add to RCA0 the comprehension scheme for Σ1 formulas in order to obtain full arithmetical comprehension.\n\nThe first-order part of ACA0 is exactly first-order Peano arithmetic; ACA0 is a conservative extension of first-order Peano arithmetic.  The two systems are provably (in a weak system) equiconsistent.  ACA0 can be thought of as a framework of predicative mathematics, although there are predicatively provable theorems that are not provable in ACA0. Most of the fundamental results about the natural numbers, and many other mathematical theorems, can be proven in this system.\n\nOne way of seeing that ACA0 is stronger than WKL0 is to exhibit a model of WKL0 that doesn't contain all arithmetical sets. In fact, it is possible to build a model of WKL0 consisting entirely of low sets using the low basis theorem, since low sets relative to low sets are low.\n\nThe following assertions are equivalent to ACA0\nover RCA0:\n The sequential completeness of the real numbers (every bounded increasing sequence of real numbers has a limit).\n The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem.\n Ascoli's theorem: every bounded equicontinuous sequence of real functions on the unit interval has a uniformly convergent subsequence.\n Every countable commutative ring has a maximal ideal.\n Every countable vector space over the rationals (or over any countable field) has a basis.\n Every countable field has a transcendence basis.\n Kőnig's lemma (for arbitrary finitely branching trees, as opposed to the weak version described above).\n Various theorems in combinatorics, such as certain forms of Ramsey's theorem.\n\n Arithmetical transfinite recursion ATR0\n\nThe system ATR0 adds to ACA0 an axiom which states, informally, that any arithmetical functional (meaning any arithmetical formula with a free number variable n and a free class variable X, seen as the operator taking X to the set of n satisfying the formula) can be iterated transfinitely along any countable well ordering starting with any set.  ATR0 is equivalent over ACA0 to the principle of Σ separation. ATR0 is impredicative, and has the proof-theoretic ordinal , the supremum of that of predicative systems.\n\nATR0 proves the consistency of ACA0, and thus by Gödel's theorem it is strictly stronger.\n\nThe following assertions are equivalent to\nATR0 over RCA0:\n Any two countable well orderings are comparable. That is, they are isomorphic or one is isomorphic to a proper initial segment of the other.\n Ulm's theorem for countable reduced Abelian groups.\n The perfect set theorem, which states that every uncountable closed subset of a complete separable metric space contains a perfect closed set.\n Lusin's separation theorem (essentially Σ separation).\n Determinacy for open sets in the Baire space.\n\n Π comprehension Π-CA0\n\nΠ-CA0 is stronger than arithmetical transfinite recursion and is fully impredicative. It consists of RCA0 plus the comprehension scheme for Π formulas.\n\nIn a sense, Π-CA0 comprehension is to arithmetical transfinite recursion (Σ separation) as ACA0 is to weak Kőnig's lemma (Σ separation).   It is equivalent to several statements of descriptive set theory whose proofs make use of strongly impredicative arguments; this equivalence shows that these impredicative arguments cannot be removed.\n\nThe following theorems are equivalent to Π-CA0  over RCA0:\n The Cantor–Bendixson theorem (every closed set of reals is the union of a perfect set and a countable set).\n Every countable abelian group is the direct sum of a divisible group and a reduced group.\n\n Additional systems \n\n Weaker systems than recursive comprehension can be defined.  The weak system RCA consists of elementary function arithmetic EFA (the basic axioms plus Δ induction in the enriched language with an exponential operation) plus Δ comprehension. Over RCA,  recursive comprehension as defined earlier (that is, with Σ induction) is equivalent to the statement that a polynomial (over a countable field) has only finitely many roots and to the classification theorem for finitely generated Abelian groups. The system RCA has the same proof theoretic ordinal ω3 as EFA and is conservative over EFA for Π sentences.\n Weak Weak Kőnig's Lemma is the statement that a subtree of the infinite binary tree having no infinite paths has an asymptotically vanishing proportion of the leaves at length n (with a uniform estimate as to how many leaves of length n exist).   An equivalent formulation is that any subset of Cantor space that has positive measure is nonempty (this is not provable in RCA0). WWKL0 is obtained by adjoining this axiom to RCA0.  It is equivalent to the statement that if the unit real interval is covered by a sequence of intervals then the sum of their lengths is at least one.  The model theory of WWKL0 is closely connected to the theory of algorithmically random sequences.  In particular, an ω-model of RCA0 satisfies weak weak Kőnig's lemma if and only if for every set X there is a set Y which is 1-random relative to X.\n DNR (short for \"diagonally non-recursive\") adds to RCA0 an axiom asserting the existence of a diagonally non-recursive function relative to every set. That is, DNR states that, for any set A, there exists a total function f such that for all e the eth partial recursive function with oracle A is not equal to f. DNR is strictly weaker than WWKL (Lempp et al., 2004).\n Δ-comprehension is in certain ways analogous to arithmetical transfinite recursion as recursive comprehension is to weak Kőnig's lemma.  It has the hyperarithmetical sets as minimal ω-model.  Arithmetical transfinite recursion proves Δ-comprehension but not the other way around.\n Σ-choice is the statement that if η(n,X) is a Σ formula such that for each n there exists an X satisfying η then there is a sequence of sets Xn such that η(n,Xn) holds for each n.  Σ-choice also has the hyperarithmetical sets as minimal ω-model.  Arithmetical transfinite recursion proves Σ-choice but not the other way around.\n HBU (short for \"uncountable Heine-Borel\") expresses the (open-cover) compactness of the unit interval, involving uncountable covers.  The latter aspect of HBU makes it only expressible in the language of third-order arithmetic.  Cousin's theorem (1895) implies HBU, and these theorems use the same notion of cover due to Cousin and Lindelöf.  HBU is hard to prove: in terms of the usual hierarchy of comprehension axioms, a proof of HBU requires full second-order arithmetic ().\n\nω-models and β-models\n\nThe ω in ω-model stands for the set of non-negative integers (or finite ordinals). An ω-model is a model for a fragment of second-order arithmetic  whose first-order part is the standard model of Peano arithmetic, but whose second-order part may be non-standard. More precisely, an ω-model is given by a choice S⊆2ω of subsets of ω. The first-order variables are interpreted in the usual way as elements of ω, and +, × have their usual meanings, while second-order variables are interpreted as elements of S.  There is a standard ω model where one just takes S to consist of all subsets of the integers. However, there are also other ω-models; for example, RCA0 has a minimal ω-model where S consists of the recursive subsets of ω.\n\nA β model is an ω model that is equivalent to the standard ω-model for Π and Σ sentences (with parameters).\n\nNon-ω models are also useful, especially in the proofs of conservation theorems.\n\n See also \n\n Symbolic regression\n Closed-form expression § Conversion from numerical forms\n Mathematical optimization\n\n References \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n External links \n Harvey Friedman's home page\n Stephen G.

      "text": "In the foundations of mathematics, Russell's paradox (also known as Russell's antinomy), discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1901,Russell, Bertrand, \"Correspondence with Frege}. In Gottlob Frege Philosophical and Mathematical Correspondence. (Translated by Hans Kaal., University of Chicago Press,  Chicago, 1980).Whitehead, A. N. and Russell, B., The Principles of Mathematics, 1903. 2d. ed. reprint, W. W. Norton & Company, New York, 1996.) showed that some attempted formalizations of the naïve set theory created by Georg Cantor led to a contradiction. The same paradox had been discovered in 1899 by Ernst ZermeloBernhard Rang, Wolfgang Thomas: Zermelo's Discovery of the \"Russell Paradox\", Historia Mathematica 8. but he did not publish the idea, which remained known only to David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and other members of the University of Göttingen. At the end of the 1890s Cantor himself had already realized that his definition would lead to a contradiction, which he told Hilbert and Richard Dedekind by letter.Walter Purkert, Hans J. Ilgauds: Vita Mathematica - Georg Cantor, Birkhäuser, 1985, \n\nAccording to naive set theory, any definable collection is a set. Let R be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.  If R is not a member of itself, then its definition dictates that it must contain itself, and if it contains itself, then it contradicts its own definition as the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. This contradiction is Russell's paradox. Symbolically:\n\nIn 1908, two ways of avoiding the paradox were proposed, Russell's type theory and the Zermelo set theory, the first constructed axiomatic set theory. Zermelo's axioms went well beyond Gottlob Frege's axioms of extensionality and unlimited set abstraction, and evolved into the now-standard Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). The essential difference between Russell's and Zermelo's solution to the paradox is that Zermelo altered the axioms of set theory while preserving the logical language in which they are expressed (the language of ZFC, with the help of Thoralf Skolem, turned out to be first-order logic) while Russell altered the logical language itself.\n\nInformal presentation\nLet us call a set \"abnormal\" if it is a member of itself, and \"normal\" otherwise.  For example, take the set of all squares in the plane. That set is not itself a square in the plane, and therefore is not a member of the set of all squares in the plane. So it is \"normal\". On the other hand, if we take the complementary set that contains all non-(squares in the plane), that set is itself not a square in the plane and so should be one of its own members as it is a non-(square in the plane). It is \"abnormal\".\n\nNow we consider the set of all normal sets, R. Determining whether R is normal or abnormal is impossible: if R were a normal set, it would be contained in the set of normal sets (itself), and therefore be abnormal; and if R were abnormal, it would not be contained in the set of all normal sets (itself), and therefore be normal. This leads to the conclusion that R is neither normal nor abnormal: Russell's paradox.\n\nFormal presentation\nDefine Naive Set Theory (NST) as the theory of predicate logic with a binary predicate  and the following axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension:\n\nfor any formula  with only the variable x free.\nSubstitute  for .  Then by existential instantiation (reusing the symbol y) and universal instantiation we have\n\na contradiction.  Therefore, NST is inconsistent.\n\nSet-theoretic responses\nIn 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed an axiomatization of set theory that avoided the paradoxes of naive set theory by replacing arbitrary set comprehension with weaker existence axioms, such as his axiom of separation (Aussonderung). Modifications to this axiomatic theory proposed in the 1920s by Abraham Fraenkel, Thoralf Skolem, and by Zermelo himself resulted in the axiomatic set theory called ZFC. This theory became widely accepted once Zermelo's axiom of choice ceased to be controversial, and ZFC has remained the canonical axiomatic set theory down to the present day.\n\nZFC does not assume that, for every property, there is a set of all things satisfying that property. Rather, it asserts that given any set X, any subset of X definable using first-order logic exists. The object R discussed above cannot be constructed in this fashion, and is therefore not a ZFC set. In some extensions of ZFC, objects like R are called proper classes.\n\nZFC is silent about types, although the cumulative hierarchy has a notion of layers that resemble types. Zermelo himself never accepted Skolem's formulation of ZFC using the language of first-order logic. As José Ferreirós notes, Zermelo insisted instead that \"propositional functions (conditions or predicates) used for separating off subsets, as well as the replacement functions, can be 'entirely arbitrary''' [ganz beliebig];\" the modern interpretation given to this statement is that Zermelo wanted to include higher-order quantification in order to avoid Skolem's paradox. Around 1930, Zermelo also introduced (apparently independently of von Neumann), the axiom of foundation, thus—as Ferreirós observes— \"by forbidding 'circular' and 'ungrounded' sets, it [ZFC] incorporated one of the crucial motivations of TT [type theory]—the principle of the types of arguments\". This 2nd order ZFC preferred by Zermelo, including axiom of foundation, allowed a rich cumulative hierarchy. Ferreirós writes that \"Zermelo's 'layers' are essentially the same as the types in the contemporary versions of simple TT [type theory] offered by Gödel and Tarski. One can describe the cumulative hierarchy into which Zermelo developed his models as the universe of a cumulative TT in which transfinite types are allowed. (Once we have adopted an impredicative standpoint, abandoning the idea that classes are constructed, it is not unnatural to accept transfinite types.) Thus, simple TT and ZFC could now be regarded as systems that 'talk' essentially about the same intended objects. The main difference is that TT relies on a strong higher-order logic, while Zermelo employed second-order logic, and ZFC can also be given a first-order formulation. The first-order 'description' of the cumulative hierarchy is much weaker, as is shown by the existence of denumerable models (Skolem paradox), but it enjoys some important advantages.\"\n\nIn ZFC, given a set A, it is possible to define a set B that consists of exactly the sets in A that are not members of themselves. B cannot be in A by the same reasoning in Russell's Paradox. This variation of Russell's paradox shows that no set contains everything.\n\nThrough the work of Zermelo and others, especially John von Neumann, the structure of what some see as the \"natural\" objects described by ZFC eventually became clear; they are the elements of the von Neumann universe, V, built up from the empty set by transfinitely iterating the power set operation. It is thus now possible again to reason about sets in a non-axiomatic fashion without running afoul of Russell's paradox, namely by reasoning about the elements of V. Whether it is appropriate to think of sets in this way is a point of contention among the rival points of view on the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nOther resolutions to Russell's paradox, more in the spirit of type theory, include the axiomatic set theories New Foundations and Scott-Potter set theory.\n\nHistory\nRussell discovered the paradox in May or June 1901. By his own account in his 1919 Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, he \"attempted to discover some flaw in Cantor's proof that there is no greatest cardinal\".Russell 1920:136 In a 1902 letter,. Also van Heijenoort 1967:124–125 he announced the discovery to Gottlob Frege of the paradox in Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift and framed the problem in terms of both logic and set theory, and in particular in terms of Frege's definition of function:\n\nRussell would go on to cover it at length in his 1903 The Principles of Mathematics, where he repeated his first encounter with the paradox:Russell 1903:101\n\nRussell wrote to Frege about the paradox just as Frege was preparing the second volume of his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik.cf van Heijenoort's commentary before Frege's Letter to Russell in van Heijenoort 1967:126. Frege responded to Russell very quickly; his letter dated 22 June 1902 appeared, with van Heijenoort's commentary in Heijenoort 1967:126–127. Frege then wrote an appendix admitting to the paradox,van Heijenoort's commentary, cf van Heijenoort 1967:126 ; Frege starts his analysis by this exceptionally honest comment : \"Hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished.  This was the position I was placed in  by a letter of Mr Bertrand Russell, just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion\" (Appendix of Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, vol. II, in The Frege Reader, p.279, translation by Michael Beaney and proposed a solution that Russell would endorse in his Principles of Mathematics,cf van Heijenoort's commentary, cf van Heijenoort 1967:126. The added text reads as follows: \" Note. The second volume of Gg., which appeared too late to be noticed in the Appendix, contains an interesting discussion of the contradiction (pp. 253–265), suggesting that the solution is to be found by denying that two propositional functions that determine equal classes must be equivalent. As it seems very likely that this is the true solution, the reader is strongly recommended to examine Frege's argument on the point\" (Russell 1903:522); The abbreviation Gg. stands for Frege's Grundgezetze der Arithmetik. Begriffsschriftlich abgeleitet. Vol. I. Jena, 1893. Vol. II. 1903. but was later considered by some to be unsatisfactory.Livio states that \"While Frege did make some desperate attempts to remedy his axiom system, he was unsuccessful. The conclusion appeared to be disastrous....\" Livio 2009:188. But van Heijenoort in his commentary before Frege's (1902) Letter to Russell describes Frege's proposed \"way out\" in some detail—the matter has to do with the \" 'transformation of the generalization of an equality into an equality of courses-of-values. For Frege a function is something incomplete, 'unsaturated' \"; this seems to contradict the contemporary notion of a \"function in extension\"; see Frege's wording at page 128: \"Incidentally, it seems to me that the expression 'a predicate is predicated of itself' is not exact. ...Therefore I would prefer to say that 'a concept is predicated of its own extension' [etc]\". But he waffles at the end of his suggestion that a function-as-concept-in-extension can be written as predicated of its function. van Heijenoort cites Quine: \"For a late and thorough study of Frege's \"way out\", see Quine 1955\": \"On Frege's way out\", Mind 64, 145–159; reprinted in Quine 1955b: Appendix. Completeness of quantification theory. Loewenheim's theorem, enclosed as a pamphlet with part of the third printing (1955) of Quine 1950 and incorporated in the revised edition (1959), 253—260\" (cf REFERENCES in van Heijenoort 1967:649)  For his part, Russell had his work at the printers and he added an appendix on the doctrine of types.Russell mentions this fact to Frege, cf van Heijenoort's commentary before Frege's (1902) Letter to Russell in van Heijenoort 1967:126\n\nErnst Zermelo in his (1908) A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering (published at the same time he published \"the first axiomatic set theory\")<ref>van Heijenoort's commentary before Zermelo (1908a) Investigations in the foundations of set theory I in van Heijenoort 1967:199</ref> laid claim to prior discovery of the antinomy in Cantor's naive set theory. He states: \"And yet, even the elementary form that Russell9 gave to the set-theoretic antinomies could have persuaded them [J. König, Jourdain, F. Bernstein] that the solution of these difficulties is not to be sought in the surrender of well-ordering but only in a suitable restriction of the notion of set\".van Heijenoort 1967:190–191. In the section before this he objects strenuously to the notion of impredicativity as defined by Poincaré (and soon to be taken by Russell, too, in his 1908 Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types cf van Heijenoort 1967:150–182). Footnote 9 is where he stakes his claim:\n\n{{quote|91903, pp. 366–368. I had, however, discovered this antinomy myself, independently of Russell, and had communicated it prior to 1903 to  Professor Hilbert among others.Ernst Zermelo (1908) A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering in van Heijenoort 1967:183–198. Livio 2009:191 reports that Zermelo \"discovered Russell's paradox independently as early as 1900\"; Livio in turn cites Ewald 1996 and van Heijenoort 1967 (cf Livio 2009:268).}}\n\nFrege sent a copy of his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik to Hilbert; as noted above, Frege's last volume mentioned the paradox that Russell had communicated to Frege. After receiving Frege's last volume, on 7 November 1903, Hilbert wrote a letter to Frege in which he said, referring to Russell's paradox, \"I believe Dr. Zermelo discovered it three or four years ago\".  A written account of Zermelo's actual argument was discovered in the Nachlass of Edmund Husserl.B. Rang and W. Thomas, \"Zermelo's discovery of the 'Russell Paradox'\", Historia Mathematica, v. 8 n. 1, 1981, pp. 15–22. \n\nIn 1923, Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed to \"dispose\" of Russell's paradox as follows:\n\nThe reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it\ncannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx) could be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition F(F(fx)), in which the outer function F and the inner function F must have different meanings, since the inner one has the form O(fx) and the outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter 'F' is common to the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if instead of F(Fu) we write (do) : F(Ou) . Ou = Fu. That disposes of Russell's paradox. (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 3.333)\n\nRussell and Alfred North Whitehead wrote their three-volume Principia Mathematica hoping to achieve what Frege had been unable to do. They sought to banish the paradoxes of naive set theory by employing a theory of types they devised for this purpose. While they succeeded in grounding arithmetic in a fashion, it is not at all evident that they did so by purely logical means. While Principia Mathematica avoided the known paradoxes and allows the derivation of a great deal of mathematics, its system gave rise to new problems.\n\nIn any event, Kurt Gödel in 1930–31 proved that while the logic of much of Principia Mathematica, now known as first-order logic, is complete, Peano arithmetic is necessarily incomplete if it is consistent. This is very widely—though not universally—regarded as having shown the logicist program of Frege to be impossible to complete.\n\nIn 2001 A Centenary International Conference celebrating the first hundred years of Russell's paradox was held in Munich and its proceedings have been published.\n\nApplied versions\nThere are some versions of this paradox that are closer to real-life situations and may be easier to understand for non-logicians. For example, the barber paradox supposes a barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves and only men who do not shave themselves. When one thinks about whether the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge.\n\nAs another example, consider five lists of encyclopedia entries within the same encyclopedia:\n\n List of articles about people:\nDon Knotts\nDon Nix\nEmperor Kōnin\nHermann Hesse\nIsaac Newton\nNikola Tesla\nPtolemy VII of Egypt\nRainie Yang\nSherlock Holmes\nSocrates List of articles starting with the letter L:\nL\nL!VE TV\nL&H\nLeivonmäki\nLondon\n...\nList of articles starting with the letter K\nList of articles starting with the letter L (itself; OK)\nList of articles starting with the letter M\n... List of articles about places:\nAsia\nEnoshima\nGermany\nLeivonmäki\nKatase River List of articles about Japan:\nEmperor Showa\nEnoshima\nKatase River\nMount Fuji\nTokyo List of all lists that do not contain themselves:\nList of articles about Japan\nList of articles about people\nList of articles about places\n...\nList of articles starting with the letter K\nList of articles starting with the letter M\n...\nList of all lists that do not contain themselves?\n\nIf the \"List of all lists that do not contain themselves\" contains itself, then it does not belong to itself and should be removed. However, if it does not list itself, then it should be added to itself.\n\nWhile appealing, these layman's versions of the paradox share a drawback: an easy refutation of the barber paradox seems to be that such a barber does not exist, or that the barber is a woman and therefore doesn't shave. The whole point of Russell's paradox is that the answer \"such a set does not exist\" means the definition of the notion of set within a given theory is unsatisfactory. Note the difference between the statements \"such a set does not exist\" and \"it is an empty set\". It is like the difference between saying \"There is no bucket\" and saying \"The bucket is empty\".\n\nA notable exception to the above may be the Grelling–Nelson paradox, in which words and meaning are the elements of the scenario rather than people and hair-cutting. Though it is easy to refute the barber's paradox by saying that such a barber does not (and cannot) exist, it is impossible to say something similar about a meaningfully defined word.\n\nOne way that the paradox has been dramatised is as follows:\n\nSuppose that every public library has to compile a catalogue of all its books. Since the catalogue is itself one of the library's books, some librarians include it in the catalogue for completeness; while others leave it out as it being one of the library's books is self-evident.\n\nNow imagine that all these catalogues are sent to the national library. Some of them include themselves in their listings, others do not. The national librarian compiles two master catalogues—one of all the catalogues that list themselves, and one of all those that don't.\n\nThe question is: should these master catalogues list themselves? The 'Catalogue of all catalogues that list themselves' is no problem. If the librarian doesn't include it in its own listing, it remains a true catalogue of those catalogues that do include themselves. If he does include it, it remains a true catalogue of those that list themselves.\n\nHowever, just as the librarian cannot go wrong with the first master catalogue, he is doomed to fail with the second. When it comes to the 'Catalogue of all catalogues that don't list themselves', the librarian cannot include it in its own listing, because then it would include itself, and so belongs to the other catalogue, that of catalogues that do include themselves. However, if the librarian leaves it out, the catalogue is incomplete. Either way, it can never be a true master catalogue of catalogues that do not list themselves.\n\nApplications and related topics\n\nRussell-like paradoxes\nAs illustrated above for the barber paradox, Russell's paradox is not hard to extend. Take:\n\n A transitive verb <V>, that can be applied to its substantive form.\n\nForm the sentence:\n\nThe <V>er that <V>s all (and only those) who don't <V> themselves,\n\nSometimes the \"all\" is replaced by \"all <V>ers\".\n\nAn example would be \"paint\":\n\nThe painter that paints all (and only those) that don't paint themselves.\nor \"elect\"\nThe elector (representative), that elects all that don't elect themselves.\n\nParadoxes that fall in this scheme include:\n\n The barber with \"shave\".\n The original Russell's paradox with \"contain\": The container (Set) that contains all (containers) that don't contain themselves.\n The Grelling–Nelson paradox with \"describer\": The describer (word) that describes all words, that don't describe themselves.\n Richard's paradox with \"denote\": The denoter (number) that denotes all denoters (numbers) that don't denote themselves. (In this paradox, all descriptions of numbers get an assigned number. The term \"that denotes all denoters (numbers) that don't denote themselves\" is here called Richardian''.)\n\nRelated paradoxes\n The liar paradox and Epimenides paradox, whose origins are ancient\n The Kleene–Rosser paradox, showing that the original lambda calculus is inconsistent, by means of a self-negating statement\n Curry's paradox (named after Haskell Curry), which does not require negation\n The smallest uninteresting integer paradox\n Girard's paradox in type theory\n\nSee also\n Basic Law V\n Cantor's diagonal argument\n Hilbert's first problem\n \"On Denoting\", one of Russell's first attempts at critiquing Frege\n Quine's paradox\n Self-reference\n Strange loop\n Universal set\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nRussell's Paradox at Cut-the-Knot\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \"Russell's Paradox\" – by A.

It is an alternative to axiomatic set theory as a foundation for much, but not all, of mathematics.\n\nA precursor to second-order arithmetic that involves third-order parameters was introduced by David Hilbert and Paul Bernays in their book Grundlagen der Mathematik. The standard axiomatization of second-order arithmetic is denoted by Z2.\n\nSecond-order arithmetic includes, but is significantly stronger than, its first-order counterpart Peano arithmetic. Unlike Peano arithmetic, second-order arithmetic allows quantification over sets of natural numbers as well as numbers themselves. Because real numbers can be represented as (infinite) sets of natural numbers in well-known ways, and because second-order arithmetic allows quantification over such sets, it is possible to formalize the real numbers in second-order arithmetic. For this reason, second-order arithmetic is sometimes called “analysis” (Sieg 2013, p. 291).\n\nSecond-order arithmetic can also be seen as a weak version of set theory in which every element is either a natural number or a set of natural numbers. Although it is much weaker than Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, second-order arithmetic can prove essentially all of the results of classical mathematics expressible in its language.\n\nA subsystem of second-order arithmetic is a theory in the language of second-order arithmetic each axiom of which is a theorem of full second-order arithmetic (Z2). Such subsystems are essential to reverse mathematics, a research program investigating how much of classical mathematics can be derived in certain weak subsystems of varying strength. Much of core mathematics can be formalized in these weak subsystems, some of which are defined below. Reverse mathematics also clarifies the extent and manner in which classical mathematics is nonconstructive.\n\nDefinition\n\nSyntax\nThe language of second-order arithmetic is two-sorted. The first sort of terms and in particular variables, usually denoted by lower case letters, consists of individuals, whose intended interpretation is as natural numbers. The other sort of variables, variously called “set variables,” “class variables,” or even “predicates” are usually denoted by upper-case letters. They refer to classes/predicates/properties of individuals, and so can be thought of as sets of natural numbers. Both individuals and set variables can be quantified universally or existentially. A formula with no bound set variables (that is, no quantifiers over set variables) is called arithmetical. An arithmetical formula may have free set variables and bound individual variables.\n\nIndividual terms are formed from the constant 0, the unary function S (the successor function), and the binary operations + and  (addition and multiplication). The successor function adds 1 to its input. The relations = (equality) and < (comparison of natural numbers) relate two individuals, whereas the relation ∈ (membership) relates an individual and a set (or class). Thus in notation the language of second-order arithmetic is given by the signature .\n\nFor example, , is a well-formed formula of second-order arithmetic that is arithmetical, has one free set variable X and one bound individual variable n (but no bound set variables, as is required of an arithmetical formula)—whereas  is a well-formed formula that is not arithmetical, having one bound set variable X and one bound individual variable n.\n\nSemantics\nSeveral different interpretations of the quantifiers are possible.    If second-order arithmetic is studied using the full semantics of second-order logic then the set quantifiers range over all subsets of the range of the number variables.  If second-order arithmetic is formalized using the semantics of first-order logic (Henkin semantics) then any model includes a domain for the set variables to range over, and this domain may be a proper subset of the full powerset of the domain of number variables (Shapiro 1991, pp. 74–75).\n\nAxioms\n\nBasic\nThe following axioms are known as the basic axioms, or sometimes the Robinson axioms. The resulting first-order theory, known as Robinson arithmetic, is essentially Peano arithmetic without induction. The domain of discourse for the  quantified variables is the natural numbers, collectively denoted by N, and including the distinguished member , called \"zero.\"\n\nThe primitive functions are the unary successor function, denoted by prefix , and two binary operations, addition and multiplication, denoted by infix \"+\" and \"\", respectively. There is also a primitive binary relation called order, denoted by infix \"<\".\n\nAxioms governing the successor function and zero:\n1.  (“the successor of a natural number is never zero”)\n2.  (“the successor function is injective”)\n3.  (“every natural number is zero or a successor”)\n\nAddition defined recursively:\n4. \n5. \n\nMultiplication defined recursively:\n6. \n7. \n\nAxioms governing the order relation \"<\":\n8.  (“no natural number is smaller than zero”)\n9. \n10.  (“every natural number is zero or bigger than zero”)\n11. \n\nThese axioms are all first-order statements. That is, all variables range over the natural numbers and not sets thereof, a fact even stronger than their being arithmetical. Moreover, there is but one existential quantifier, in axiom 3. Axioms 1 and 2, together with an axiom schema of induction make up the usual Peano-Dedekind definition of N. Adding to these axioms any sort of axiom schema of induction makes redundant the axioms 3, 10, and 11.\n\nInduction and comprehension schema\nIf φ(n) is a formula of second-order arithmetic with a free number variable n and possible other free number or set variables (written m• and X•), the induction axiom for φ is the axiom:\n\nThe (full) second-order induction scheme consists of all instances of this axiom, over all second-order formulas.\n\nOne particularly important instance of the induction scheme is when φ is the formula “” expressing the fact that n is a member of X (X being a free set variable): in this case, the induction axiom for φ is\n\nThis sentence is called the second-order induction axiom.\n\nIf φ(n) is a formula with a free variable n and possibly other free variables, but not the variable Z, the comprehension axiom for φ is the formula\n\nThis axiom makes it possible to form the set  of natural numbers satisfying φ(n).  There is a technical restriction that the formula φ may not contain the variable Z, for otherwise the formula  would lead to the comprehension axiom\n,\nwhich is inconsistent.  This convention is assumed in the remainder of this article.\n\nThe full system\nThe formal theory of second-order arithmetic (in the language of second-order arithmetic) consists of the basic axioms, the comprehension axiom for every formula φ (arithmetic or otherwise), and the second-order induction axiom. This theory is sometimes called full second-order arithmetic to distinguish it from its subsystems, defined below. Because full second-order semantics imply that every possible set exists, the comprehension axioms may be taken to be part of the deductive system when these semantics are employed (Shapiro 1991, p. 66).\n\nModels\nThis section describes second-order arithmetic with first-order semantics. Thus a model  of the language of second-order arithmetic consists of a set M (which forms the range of individual variables) together with a constant 0 (an element of M), a function S from M to M, two binary operations + and · on M, a binary relation < on M, and a collection D of subsets of M, which is the range of the set variables.  Omitting D produces a model of the language of first-order arithmetic.\n\nWhen D is the full powerset of M, the model  is called a full model.  The use of full second-order semantics is equivalent to limiting the models of second-order arithmetic to the full models.  In fact, the axioms of second-order arithmetic have only one full model. This follows from the fact that the axioms of Peano arithmetic with the second-order induction axiom have only one model under second-order semantics.\n\nWhen M is the usual set of natural numbers with its usual operations,  is called an ω-model.  In this case, the model may be identified with D, its collection of sets of naturals, because this set is enough to completely determine an ω-model.\n\nThe unique full -model, which is the usual set of natural numbers with its usual structure and all its subsets, is called the intended or standard model of second-order arithmetic.\n\nDefinable functions\nThe first-order functions that are provably total in second-order arithmetic are precisely the same as those representable in system F (Girard and Taylor 1987, pp. 122–123).  Almost equivalently, system F is the theory of functionals corresponding to second-order arithmetic in a manner parallel to how Gödel's system T corresponds to first-order arithmetic in the Dialectica interpretation.\n\nSubsystems\n\nThere are many named subsystems of second-order arithmetic.\n\nA subscript 0 in the name of a subsystem indicates that it includes only\na restricted portion of the full second-order induction scheme (Friedman 1976). Such a restriction lowers the proof-theoretic strength of the system significantly. For example, the system ACA0 described below is equiconsistent with Peano arithmetic. The corresponding theory ACA, consisting of ACA0 plus the full second-order induction scheme, is stronger than Peano arithmetic.\n\nArithmetical comprehension\nMany of the well-studied subsystems are related to closure properties of models.  For example, it can be shown that every ω-model of full second-order arithmetic is closed under Turing jump, but not every ω-model closed under Turing jump is a model of full second-order arithmetic.  The subsystem ACA0 includes just enough axioms to capture the notion of closure under Turing jump.\n\nACA0 is defined as the theory consisting of the basic axioms, the arithmetical comprehension axiom scheme (in other words the comprehension axiom for every arithmetical formula φ) and the ordinary second-order induction axiom. It would be equivalent to include the entire arithmetical induction axiom scheme, in other words to include the induction axiom for every arithmetical formula φ.\n\nIt can be shown that a collection S of subsets of ω determines an ω-model of ACA0 if and only if S is closed under Turing jump, Turing reducibility, and Turing join (Simpson 2009, pp. 311–313).\n\nThe subscript 0 in ACA0 indicates that not every instance of the induction axiom scheme is included this subsystem.  This makes no difference for ω-models, which automatically satisfy every instance of the induction axiom.  It is of importance, however, in the study of non-ω-models.  The system consisting of ACA0 plus induction for all formulas is sometimes called ACA with no subscript.\n\nThe system ACA0 is a conservative extension of first-order arithmetic (or first-order Peano axioms), defined as the basic axioms, plus the first-order induction axiom scheme (for all formulas φ involving no class variables at all, bound or otherwise), in the language of first-order arithmetic (which does not permit class variables at all). In particular it has the same proof-theoretic ordinal ε0 as first-order arithmetic, owing to the limited induction schema.\n\nThe arithmetical hierarchy for formulas\n\nA formula is called bounded arithmetical, or Δ00, when all its quantifiers are of the form ∀n<t or ∃n<t (where n is the individual variable being quantified and t is an individual term), where\n\nstands for\n\nand\n\nstands for\n.\n\nA formula is called Σ01 (or sometimes Σ1), respectively Π01 (or sometimes Π1) when it of the form ∃m•(φ), respectively ∀m•(φ) where φ is a bounded arithmetical formula and m is an individual variable (that is free in φ).  More generally, a formula is called Σ0n, respectively Π0n when it is obtained by adding existential, respectively universal, individual quantifiers to a Π0n−1, respectively Σ0n−1 formula (and Σ00 and Π00 are all equivalent to Δ00).  By construction, all these formulas are arithmetical (no class variables are ever bound) and, in fact, by putting the formula in Skolem prenex form one can see that every arithmetical formula is equivalent to a Σ0n or Π0n formula for all large enough n.\n\nRecursive comprehension\nThe subsystem  RCA0  is a weaker system than ACA0 and is often used as the base system in reverse mathematics.  It consists of: the basic axioms, the Σ01 induction scheme, and the Δ01 comprehension scheme.  The former term is clear: the Σ01 induction scheme is the induction axiom for every Σ01 formula φ.  The term “Δ01 comprehension” is more complex, because there is no such thing as a Δ01 formula. The  Δ01 comprehension scheme instead asserts the comprehension axiom for every Σ01 formula which is equivalent to a Π01 formula. This scheme includes,  for every Σ01 formula φ and every Π01 formula ψ, the axiom:\n\nThe set of first-order consequences of  RCA0  is the same as those of the subsystem IΣ1 of Peano arithmetic in which induction is restricted to Σ01 formulas. In turn, IΣ1 is conservative over primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA) for  sentences. Moreover, the proof-theoretic ordinal of  is ωω, the same as that of PRA.\n\nIt can be seen that a collection S of subsets of ω determines an ω-model of RCA0 if and only if S is closed under Turing reducibility and Turing join.   In particular, the collection of all computable subsets of ω gives an ω-model of RCA0.  This is the motivation behind the name of this system—if a set can be proved to exist using RCA0, then the set is recursive (i.e. computable).\n\n Weaker systems \nSometimes an even weaker system than RCA0 is desired.  One such system is defined as follows: one must first augment the language of arithmetic with an exponential function (in stronger systems the exponential can be defined in terms of addition and multiplication by the usual trick, but when the system becomes too weak this is no longer possible) and the basic axioms by the obvious axioms defining exponentiation inductively from multiplication; then the system consists of the (enriched) basic axioms, plus Δ01 comprehension, plus Δ00 induction.\n\nStronger systems\n\nOver ACA0, each formula of second-order arithmetic is equivalent to a Σ1n or Π1n formula for all large enough n.  The system Π11-comprehension is the system consisting of the basic axioms, plus the ordinary second-order induction axiom and the comprehension axiom for every Π11 formula φ.  This is equivalent to Σ11-comprehension (on the other hand, Δ11-comprehension, defined analogously to Δ01-comprehension, is weaker).\n\n Projective determinacy \nProjective determinacy is the assertion that every two-player perfect information game with moves being integers, game length ω and projective payoff set is determined, that is one of the players has a winning strategy.  (The first player wins the game if the play belongs to the payoff set; otherwise, the second player wins.)  A set is projective iff (as a predicate) it is expressible by a formula in the language of second-order arithmetic, allowing real numbers as parameters, so projective determinacy is expressible as a schema in the language of Z2.\n\nMany natural propositions expressible in the language of second-order arithmetic are independent of Z2 and even ZFC but are provable from projective determinacy.  Examples include coanalytic perfect subset property, measurability and the property of Baire for  sets,  uniformization, etc.  Over a weak base theory (such as RCA0), projective determinacy implies comprehension and provides an essentially complete theory of second-order arithmetic — natural statements in the language of Z2 that are independent of Z2 with projective determinacy are hard to find (Woodin 2001).\n\nZFC + {there are n Woodin cardinals: n is a natural number} is conservative over Z2 with projective determinacy, that is a statement in the language of second-order arithmetic is provable in Z2 with projective determinacy iff its translation into the language of set theory is provable in ZFC + {there are n Woodin cardinals: n∈N}.\n\nCoding mathematics\n\nSecond-order arithmetic directly formalizes natural numbers and sets of natural numbers.  However, it is able to formalize other mathematical objects indirectly via coding techniques, a fact which was first noticed by Weyl (Simpson 2009, p. 16). The integers, rational numbers, and real numbers can all be formalized in the subsystem RCA0, along with complete separable metric spaces and continuous functions between them (Simpson 2009, Chapter II).\n\nThe research program of Reverse Mathematics uses these formalizations of mathematics in second-order arithmetic to study the set-existence axioms required to prove mathematical theorems (Simpson 2009, p. 32). For example, the intermediate value theorem for functions from the reals to the reals is provable in RCA0 (Simpson 2009, p. 87), while the Bolzano/Weierstrass theorem is equivalent to ACA0 over RCA0 (Simpson 2009, p. 34).\n\nReferences\nBurgess, J.

Dan Willard was the first to investigate their properties, and he has described a family of such systems.  According to Gödel's incompleteness theorem, these systems cannot contain the theory of Peano arithmetic, and in fact, not even its weak fragment Robinson arithmetic; nonetheless, they can contain strong theorems.\n\nIn outline, the key to Willard's construction of his system is to formalise enough of the Gödel machinery to talk about provability internally without being able to formalise diagonalisation. Diagonalisation depends upon being able to prove that multiplication is a total function (and in the earlier versions of the result, addition also). Addition and multiplication are not function symbols of Willard's language; instead, subtraction and division are, with the addition and multiplication predicates being defined in terms of these.

      "text": "The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem is a fundamental result of mathematical analysis giving necessary and sufficient conditions to decide whether every sequence of a given family of real-valued continuous functions defined on a closed and bounded interval has a uniformly convergent subsequence.  The main condition is the equicontinuity of the family of functions. The theorem is the basis of many proofs in mathematics, including that of the Peano existence theorem in the theory of ordinary differential equations, Montel's theorem in complex analysis, and the Peter–Weyl theorem in harmonic analysis and various results concerning compactness of integral operators.\n\nThe notion of equicontinuity was introduced in the late 19th century by the Italian mathematicians Cesare Arzelà and Giulio Ascoli. A weak form of the theorem was proven by , who established the sufficient condition for compactness, and by , who established the necessary condition and gave the first clear presentation of the result.  A further generalization of the theorem was proven by , to sets of real-valued continuous functions with domain a compact metric space .  Modern formulations of the theorem allow for the domain to be compact Hausdorff and for the range to be an arbitrary metric space.  More general formulations of the theorem exist that give necessary and sufficient conditions for a family of functions from a compactly generated Hausdorff space into a uniform space to be compact in the compact-open topology; see .\n\n Statement and first consequences \nBy definition, a sequence  of continuous functions on an interval  is uniformly bounded if there is a number  such that\n\nfor every function  belonging to the sequence, and every .  (Here,   must be independent of  and .) \n\nThe sequence is said to be equicontinuous if, for every  and , there exists a  such that\n\nwhenever  for all functions  in the sequence. (Here,  may depend on  and , but not on  or .)\n\nOne version of the theorem can be stated as follows:\n\nConsider a sequence of real-valued continuous functions  defined on a closed and bounded interval  of the real line. If this sequence is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous, then there exists a subsequence  that converges uniformly. \nThe converse is also true, in the sense that if every subsequence of itself has a uniformly convergent subsequence, then is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. \n\n(See below for a proof.)\n\nExamples\n\nDifferentiable functions\nThe hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied by a uniformly bounded sequence of differentiable functions with uniformly bounded derivatives. Indeed, uniform boundedness of the derivatives implies by the mean value theorem that for all  and ,\n\nwhere K is the supremum of the derivatives of functions in the sequence and is independent of .  So, given , let  to verify the definition of equicontinuity of the sequence.  This proves the following corollary:\n\n Let {fn} be a uniformly bounded sequence of real-valued differentiable functions on  such that the derivatives {fn′} are uniformly bounded. Then there exists a subsequence {fnk} that converges uniformly on .\n\nIf, in addition, the sequence of second derivatives is also uniformly bounded, then the derivatives also converge uniformly (up to a subsequence), and so on. Another generalization holds for continuously differentiable functions.  Suppose that the functions  are continuously differentiable with derivatives . Suppose that fn′ are uniformly equicontinuous and uniformly bounded, and that the sequence  is pointwise bounded (or just bounded at a single point).  Then there is a subsequence of the converging uniformly to a continuously differentiable function.\n\nThe diagonalization argument can also be used to show that a family of infinitely differentiable functions, whose derivatives of each order are uniformly bounded, has a uniformly convergent subsequence, all of whose derivatives are also uniformly convergent. This is particularly important in the theory of distributions.\n\nLipschitz and Hölder continuous functions\nThe argument given above proves slightly more, specifically\n\n If is a uniformly bounded sequence of real valued functions on  such that each f is Lipschitz continuous with the same Lipschitz constant :\n\nfor all  and all , then there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on .\n\nThe limit function is also Lipschitz continuous with the same value  for the Lipschitz constant. A slight refinement is\n\n A set  of functions  on  that is uniformly bounded and satisfies a Hölder condition of order , , with a fixed constant ,\n\nis relatively compact in .  In particular, the unit ball of the Hölder space  is compact in .\n\nThis holds more generally for scalar functions on a compact metric space  satisfying a Hölder condition with respect to the metric on .\n\nEuclidean spaces\nThe Arzelà–Ascoli theorem holds, more generally, if the functions  take values in -dimensional Euclidean space , and the proof is very simple: just apply the -valued version of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem  times to extract a subsequence that converges uniformly in the first coordinate, then a sub-subsequence that converges uniformly in the first two coordinates, and so on.  The above examples generalize easily to the case of functions with values in Euclidean space.\n\n Proof \nThe proof is essentially based on a diagonalization argument.  The simplest case is of real-valued functions on a closed and bounded interval:\n\n Let  be a closed and bounded interval.  If F is an infinite set of functions  which is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous, then there is a sequence fn of elements of F such that fn converges uniformly on I.\n\nFix an enumeration {xi}i ∈N of rational numbers in I.  Since F is uniformly bounded, the set of points {f(x1)}f∈F is bounded, and hence by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, there is a sequence {fn1} of distinct functions in F such that {fn1(x1)} converges.  Repeating the same argument for the sequence of points {fn1(x2)}, there is a subsequence {fn2} of {fn1} such that {fn2(x2)} converges.\n\nBy induction this process can be continued forever, and so there is a chain of subsequences\n\nsuch that, for each k = 1, 2, 3, ..., the subsequence {fnk} converges at x1, ..., xk.  Now form the diagonal subsequence {f<sub></sub>} whose mth term fm is the mth term in the mth subsequence {fnm}. By construction, fm converges at every rational point of I.\n\nTherefore, given any  and rational xk in I, there is an integer  such that\n\nSince the family F is equicontinuous, for this fixed ε and for every x in I, there is an open interval Ux containing x such that\n\nfor all f ∈ F and all s, t in I such that .\n\nThe collection of intervals Ux, x ∈ I,  forms an open cover of I.  Since I  is compact, this covering admits a finite subcover .  There exists an integer K such that each open interval Uj, , contains a rational xk with .  Finally, for any t ∈ I, there are j and k so that t and xk belong to the same interval Uj.  For this choice of k,\n\nfor all   Consequently, the sequence {fn} is uniformly Cauchy, and therefore converges to a continuous function, as claimed.  This completes the proof.\n\nGeneralizations\n\n Compact metric spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces \nThe definitions of boundedness and equicontinuity can be generalized to the setting of arbitrary compact metric spaces and, more generally still, compact Hausdorff spaces.  Let X be a compact Hausdorff space, and let C(X) be the space of real-valued continuous functions on X. A subset  is said to be equicontinuous if for every x ∈ X and every , x has a neighborhood Ux such that\n\nA set  is said to be pointwise bounded if for every x ∈ X,\n\nA version of the Theorem holds also in the space C(X) of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space X :\n\nLet X be a compact Hausdorff space. Then a subset F of C(X) is relatively compact in the topology induced by the uniform norm if and only if it is equicontinuous and pointwise bounded.\n\nThe Arzelà–Ascoli theorem is thus a fundamental result in the study of the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space.\n\nVarious generalizations of the above quoted result are possible.  For instance, the functions can assume values in a metric space or (Hausdorff) topological vector space with only minimal changes to the statement (see, for instance, , ):\n\nLet X be a compact Hausdorff space and Y a metric space. Then  is compact in the compact-open topology if and only if it is equicontinuous, pointwise relatively compact and closed.\n\nHere pointwise relatively compact means that for each x ∈ X, the set is relatively compact in Y.\n\nThe proof given can be generalized in a way that does not rely on the separability of the domain.  On a compact Hausdorff space X, for instance, the equicontinuity is used to extract, for each ε = 1/n, a finite open covering of X such that the oscillation of any function in the family is less than ε on each open set in the cover.  The role of the rationals can then be played by a set of points drawn from each open set in each of the countably many covers obtained in this way, and the main part of the proof proceeds exactly as above.\n\nNecessity\nWhereas most formulations of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem assert sufficient conditions for a family of functions to be (relatively) compact in some topology, these conditions are typically also necessary.  For instance, if a set F is compact in C(X), the Banach space of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space with respect to its uniform norm, then it is bounded in the uniform norm on C(X) and in particular is pointwise bounded. Let N(ε, U) be the set of all functions in F whose oscillation over an open subset U ⊂ X is less than ε:\n\nFor a fixed x∈X and ε, the sets N(ε, U) form an open covering of F as U varies over all open neighborhoods of x.  Choosing a finite subcover then gives equicontinuity.\n\n Examples \n To every function  that is -integrable on , with , associate the function  defined on  by\n\nLet  be the set of functions  corresponding to functions  in the unit ball of the space . If  is the Hölder conjugate of , defined by , then Hölder's inequality implies that all functions in  satisfy a Hölder condition with  and constant .\n\nIt follows that  is compact in . This means that the correspondence  defines a compact linear operator  between the Banach spaces  and .  Composing with the injection of  into , one sees that  acts compactly from  to itself.  The case  can be seen as a simple instance of the fact that the injection from the Sobolev space  into , for  a bounded open set in , is compact.\n\nWhen  is a compact linear operator from a Banach space  to a Banach space , its transpose  is compact from the (continuous) dual  to . This can be checked by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem.\n\nIndeed, the image  of the closed unit ball  of  is contained in a compact subset  of . The unit ball  of  defines, by restricting from  to , a set  of (linear) continuous functions on  that is bounded and equicontinuous. By Arzelà–Ascoli, for every sequence  in , there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on , and this implies that the image  of that subsequence is Cauchy in .\n\nWhen  is holomorphic in an open disk , with modulus bounded by , then (for example by Cauchy's formula) its derivative  has modulus bounded by  in the smaller disk  If a family of holomorphic functions on  is bounded by  on , it follows that the family  of restrictions to  is equicontinuous on .  Therefore, a sequence converging uniformly on  can be extracted.  This is a first step in the direction of  Montel's theorem.\n\n See also \nHelly's selection theorem\nFréchet–Kolmogorov theorem\n\n References \n .\n .\n .\n .\n \n .\n .\n Arzelà-Ascoli theorem at Encyclopaedia of Mathematics\n \n \n \n\nCategory:Continuous mappings\nCategory:Topology of function spaces\nCategory:Articles containing proofs\nCategory:Compactness theorems\nCategory:Theorems in functional analysis"

      "text": "Automated theorem proving (also known as ATP or automated deduction) is a subfield of automated reasoning and mathematical logic dealing with proving mathematical theorems by computer programs.  Automated reasoning over mathematical proof was a major impetus for the development of computer science.\n\n Logical foundations \nWhile the roots of formalised logic go back to Aristotle, the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the development of modern logic and formalised mathematics. Frege's Begriffsschrift (1879) introduced both a complete propositional calculus and what is essentially modern predicate logic.  His Foundations of Arithmetic, published 1884, expressed (parts of) mathematics in formal logic. This approach was continued by Russell and Whitehead in their influential Principia Mathematica, first published 1910–1913, and with a revised second edition in 1927. Russell and Whitehead thought they could derive all mathematical truth using axioms and inference rules of formal logic, in principle opening up the process to automatisation. In 1920, Thoralf Skolem simplified a previous result by Leopold Löwenheim, leading to the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and, in 1930, to the notion of a Herbrand universe and a Herbrand interpretation that allowed (un)satisfiability of first-order formulas (and hence the validity of a theorem) to be reduced to (potentially infinitely many) propositional satisfiability problems.\n\nIn 1929, Mojżesz Presburger showed that the theory of natural numbers with addition and equality (now called Presburger arithmetic in his honor) is decidable and gave an algorithm that could determine if a given sentence in the language was true or false.)\nHowever, shortly after this positive result, Kurt Gödel published On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems (1931), showing that in any sufficiently strong axiomatic system there are true statements which cannot be proved in the system. This topic was further developed in the 1930s by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, who on the one hand gave two independent but equivalent definitions of computability, and on the other gave concrete examples for undecidable questions.\n\n First implementations \n\nShortly after World War II, the first general purpose computers became available. In 1954, Martin Davis programmed Presburger's algorithm for a JOHNNIAC vacuum tube computer at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. According to Davis, \"Its great triumph was to prove that the sum of two even numbers is even\". More ambitious was the Logic Theory Machine in 1956, a deduction system for the propositional logic of the Principia Mathematica, developed by Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon and J. C. Shaw. Also running on a JOHNNIAC, the Logic Theory Machine constructed proofs from a small set of propositional axioms and three deduction rules: modus ponens, (propositional) variable substitution, and the replacement of formulas by their definition. The system used heuristic guidance, and managed to prove 38 of the first 52 theorems of the Principia.\n\nThe \"heuristic\" approach of the Logic Theory Machine tried to emulate human mathematicians, and could not guarantee that a proof could be found for every valid theorem even in principle.  In contrast, other, more systematic algorithms achieved, at least theoretically, completeness for first-order logic. Initial approaches relied on the results of Herbrand and Skolem to convert a first-order formula into successively larger sets of propositional formulae by instantiating variables with terms from the Herbrand universe. The propositional formulas could then be checked for unsatisfiability using a number of methods. Gilmore's program used conversion to disjunctive normal form, a form in which the satisfiability of a formula is obvious.\n\n Decidability of the problem \n\nDepending on the underlying logic, the problem of deciding the validity of a formula varies from trivial to impossible. For the frequent case of propositional logic, the problem is decidable but co-NP-complete, and hence only exponential-time algorithms are believed to exist for general proof tasks. For a first order predicate calculus, Gödel's completeness theorem states that the theorems (provable statements) are exactly the logically valid well-formed formulas, so identifying valid formulas is recursively enumerable: given unbounded resources, any valid formula can eventually be proven. However, invalid formulas (those that are not entailed by a given theory), cannot always be recognized.\n\nThe above applies to first order theories, such as Peano arithmetic. However, for a specific model that may be described by a first order theory, some statements may be true but undecidable in the theory used to describe the model. For example, by Gödel's incompleteness theorem, we know that any theory whose proper axioms are true for the natural numbers cannot prove all first order statements true for the natural numbers, even if the list of proper axioms is allowed to be infinite enumerable. It follows that an automated theorem prover will fail to terminate while searching for a proof precisely when the statement being investigated is undecidable in the theory being used, even if it is true in the model of interest. Despite this theoretical limit, in practice, theorem provers can solve many hard problems, even in models that are not fully described by any first order theory (such as the integers).\n\n Related problems \n\nA simpler, but related, problem is proof verification, where an existing proof for a theorem is certified valid. For this, it is generally required that each individual proof step can be verified by a primitive recursive function or program, and hence the problem is always decidable.\n\nSince the proofs generated by automated theorem provers are typically very large, the problem of proof compression is crucial and various techniques aiming at making the prover's output smaller, and consequently more easily understandable and checkable, have been developed.\n\nProof assistants require a human user to give hints to the system. Depending on the degree of automation, the prover can essentially be reduced to a proof checker, with the user providing the proof in a formal way, or significant proof tasks can be performed automatically. Interactive provers are used for a variety of tasks, but even fully automatic systems have proved a number of interesting and hard theorems, including at least one that has eluded human mathematicians for a long time, namely the Robbins conjecture. However, these successes are sporadic, and work on hard problems usually requires a proficient user.\n\nAnother distinction is sometimes drawn between theorem proving and other techniques, where a process is considered to be theorem proving if it consists of a traditional proof, starting with axioms and producing new inference steps using rules of inference.  Other techniques would include model checking, which, in the simplest case, involves brute-force enumeration of many possible states (although the actual implementation of model checkers requires much cleverness, and does not simply reduce to brute force).\n\nThere are hybrid theorem proving systems which use model checking as an inference rule. There are also programs which were written to prove a particular theorem, with a (usually informal) proof that if the program finishes with a certain result, then the theorem is true. A good example of this was the machine-aided proof of the four color theorem, which was very controversial as the first claimed mathematical proof which was essentially impossible to verify by humans due to the enormous size of the program's calculation (such proofs are called non-surveyable proofs).  Another example of a program-assisted proof is the one that shows that the game of Connect Four can always be won by first player.\n\n Industrial uses \n\nCommercial use of automated theorem proving is mostly concentrated in integrated circuit design and verification.  Since the Pentium FDIV bug, the complicated floating point units of modern microprocessors have been designed with extra scrutiny. AMD, Intel and others use automated theorem proving to verify that division and other operations are correctly implemented in their processors.\n\nFirst-order theorem proving\nIn the late 1960s agencies funding research in automated deduction began to emphasize the need for practical applications. One of the first fruitful areas was that of program verification whereby first-order theorem provers were applied to the problem of verifying the correctness of computer programs in languages such as Pascal, Ada, Java etc. Notable among early program verification systems was the Stanford Pascal Verifier developed by David Luckham at Stanford University. This was based on the Stanford Resolution Prover also developed at Stanford using John Alan Robinson's resolution principle. This was the first automated deduction system to demonstrate an ability to solve mathematical problems that were announced in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society before solutions were formally published.\n\nFirst-order theorem proving is one of the most mature subfields of automated theorem proving. The logic is expressive enough to allow the specification of arbitrary problems, often in a reasonably natural and intuitive way. On the other hand, it is still semi-decidable, and a number of sound and complete calculi have been developed, enabling fully automated systems. More expressive logics, such as Higher-order logics, allow the convenient expression of a wider range of problems than first order logic, but theorem proving for these logics is less well developed.\n\nBenchmarks, competitions, and sources \nThe quality of implemented systems has benefited from the existence of a large library of standard benchmark examples — the Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) Problem Library  — as well as from the CADE ATP System Competition (CASC), a yearly competition of first-order systems for many important classes of first-order problems.\n\nSome important systems (all have won at least one CASC competition division) are listed below.\n E is a high-performance prover for full first-order logic, but built on a purely equational calculus, originally developed in the automated reasoning group of Technical University of Munich, and now at Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University in Stuttgart.\n Otter, developed at the Argonne National Laboratory, is based on first-order resolution and paramodulation. Otter has since been replaced by Prover9, which is paired with Mace4.\n SETHEO is a high-performance system based on the goal-directed model elimination calculus. It is developed in the automated reasoning group of Technical University of Munich. E and SETHEO have been combined (with other systems) in the composite theorem prover E-SETHEO.\n Vampire is developed and implemented at Manchester University by Andrei Voronkov and Krystof Hoder, formerly also by Alexandre Riazanov. It has won the CADE ATP System Competition in the most prestigious CNF (MIX) division for eleven years (1999, 2001–2010).\n Waldmeister is a specialized system for unit-equational first-order logic developed by Arnim Buch and Thomas Hillenbrand. It won the CASC UEQ division for fourteen consecutive years (1997–2010).\n SPASS is a first order logic theorem prover with equality. This is developed by the research group Automation of Logic, Max Planck Institute for Computer Science.\n\nThe Theorem Prover Museum is an initiative to conserve the sources of theorem prover systems for future analysis, since they are important cultural/scientific artefacts.

      "text": "In mathematical logic, the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation, or BHK interpretation, of intuitionistic logic was proposed by L. E. J. Brouwer and Arend Heyting, and independently by Andrey Kolmogorov. It is also sometimes called the realizability interpretation, because of the connection with the realizability theory of Stephen Kleene.\n\n The interpretation \n\nThe interpretation states what is intended to be a proof of a given formula. This is specified by induction on the structure of that formula:\n\nA proof of  is a pair <a, b> where a is a proof of  and b is a proof of .\nA proof of  is a pair <a, b> where a is 0 and b is a proof of , or a is 1 and b is a proof of .\nA proof of  is a function   that converts a proof of  into a proof of .\nA proof of  is a pair <a, b> where a is an element of S, and b is a proof of .\nA proof of  is a function   that converts an element a of S into a proof of .\nThe formula  is defined as , so a proof of it is a function f  that converts a proof of  into a proof of .\nThere is no proof of  (the absurdity, or bottom type (nontermination in some programming languages) ).\n\nThe interpretation of a primitive proposition is supposed to be known from context. In the context of arithmetic, a proof of the formula s=t is a computation reducing the two terms to the same numeral.\n\nKolmogorov followed the same lines but phrased his interpretation in terms of problems and solutions. To assert a formula is to claim to know a solution to the problem represented by that formula. For instance  is the problem of reducing Q to P; to solve it requires a method to solve problem Q given a solution to problem P.\n\n Examples \n\nThe identity function is a proof of the formula , no matter what P is.\n\nThe law of non-contradiction  expands to :\n A proof of  is a function  that converts a proof of  into a proof of .\n A proof of  is a pair of proofs <a,b>, where  is a proof of P, and  is a proof of .\n A proof of  is a function that converts a proof of P into a proof of .\nPutting it all together, a proof of  is a function  that converts a pair <a,b> – where  is a proof of P, and  is a function that converts a proof of P into a proof of  – into a proof of .\nThere is a function  that does this, where , proving the law of non-contradiction, no matter what P is. \n\nIndeed, the same line of thought provides a proof for  as well, where  is any proposition.\n\nOn the other hand, the law of excluded middle  expands to , and in general has no proof.  According to the interpretation, a proof of  is a pair <a, b> where a is 0 and b is a proof of P, or a is 1 and b is a proof of . Thus if neither P nor  is provable then neither is .\n\n What is absurdity? \n\nIt is not in general possible for a logical system to have a formal negation operator such that there is a proof of \"not\"  exactly when there isn't a proof of  ; see Gödel's incompleteness theorems. The BHK interpretation instead takes \"not\"  to mean that  leads to absurdity, designated , so that a proof of ¬ is a function converting a proof of  into a proof of absurdity.\n\nA standard example of absurdity is found in dealing with arithmetic. Assume that 0 = 1, and proceed by mathematical induction: 0 = 0 by the axiom of equality. Now (induction hypothesis), if 0 were equal to a certain natural number n, then 1 would be equal to n+1, (Peano axiom: Sm = Sn if and only if m = n), but since 0=1, therefore 0 would also be equal to n + 1. By induction, 0 is equal to all numbers, and therefore any two natural numbers become equal.\n\nTherefore, there is a way to go from a proof of 0=1 to a proof of any basic arithmetic equality, and thus to a proof of any complex arithmetic proposition. Furthermore, to get this result it was not necessary to invoke the Peano axiom that states that 0 is \"not\" the successor of any natural number. This makes 0=1 suitable as  in Heyting arithmetic (and the Peano axiom is rewritten 0 = Sn → 0 = S0). This use of 0 = 1 validates the principle of explosion.\n\n What is a function? \n\nThe BHK interpretation will depend on the view taken about what constitutes a function that converts one proof to another, or that converts an element of a domain to a proof. Different versions of constructivism will diverge on this point.\n\nKleene's realizability theory identifies the functions with the computable functions. It deals with Heyting arithmetic, where the domain of quantification is the natural numbers and the primitive propositions are of the form x=y. A proof of x=y is simply the trivial algorithm if x evaluates to the same number that y does (which is always decidable for natural numbers), otherwise there is no proof. These are then built up by induction into more complex algorithms.\n\nIf one takes lambda calculus as defining the notion of a function, then the BHK interpretation describes the correspondence between natural deduction and functions.\n\n References \n\nCategory:Dependently typed programming\nCategory:Functional programming\nCategory:Constructivism (mathematics)"

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyrate",
      "text": "Butyrate or butanoate is the traditional name for the conjugate base of butyric acid (also known as butanoic acid). The formula of the butyrate ion is . The name is used as part of the name of  esters and salts of butyric acid\n\nIn nature\nAs a short chain fatty acid, butyric acid is fully ionized near neutral pH.  In nature, the cation associated with butyrate is unknown or unimportant to the metabolizing enzymes.  \n\nButyrates are important as food for cells lining the mammalian colon (colonocytes). Without butyrates for energy, colon cells undergo autophagy (self digestion) and die.\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which include butyrate, are produced by beneficial colonic bacteria (probiotics) that feed on, or ferment prebiotics, which are plant products that contain adequate amounts of dietary fiber. These SCFAs benefit the colonocytes (cells of the colon) by increasing energy production and cell proliferation, and may protect against colon cancer.\n\nButyrate is a major metabolite in colonic lumen arising from bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and has been shown to be a critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response. In fact, butyrate is responsible for about 70% of energy from the colonocytes, being a critical SCFA in the colon homeostasis. Butyrate possesses both preventive and therapeutic potential to counteract inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer. The reason why butyrate is an energy source for normal colonocytes and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells, is due to the Warburg effect in cancer cells, which leads to butyrate not being properly metabolized. This phenomenon leads to the accumulation of butyrate in the nucleus, acting as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. One mechanism underlying butyrate function in suppression of colonic inflammation is inhibition of the IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling pathways at least partially through acting as a HDAC inhibitor. It has been shown that Butyrate inhibits activity of HDAC1 that is bound to the Fas gene promoter in T cells, resulting in hyperacetylation of the Fas promoter and upregulation of Fas receptor on the T cell surface. It is thus suggested that butyrate enhances apoptosis of T cells in the colonic tissue and thereby eliminates the source of inflammation (IFN-γ production). Butyrate inhibits angiogenesis by inactivating Sp1 transcription factor activity and downregulating vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression.\n\nAs a Human Metabolite and Immune Regulator\n\nButyrate is extremely essential to host immune homeostasis. Although the role and importance of butyrate in the gut is not fully understood, many researchers argue that a depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria in patients with several vasculitic conditions is essential to the pathogenesis these disorders.\n\nA depletion of butyrate in the gut is typically caused by an absence or depletion of butyrate-producing-bacteria (BPB). This depletion in BPB leads to microbial dysbiosis. This dysbiosis is characterized by an overall low biodiversity and a depletion of key butyrate-producing members. Butyrate is an essential microbial metabolite with a vital role as a modulator of proper immune function in the host. Butyrate—the conjugate base of butyric acid—exerts a key role for the maintenance of immune homeostasis both local (in the gut) and systemic (via circulating butyrate). Butyrate has shown to promote the differentiation of T-regulatory cells. In particular, circulating butyrate prompts the generation of extrathymic T-regulatory cells. The low-levels of butyrate in human subjects could favor reduced T-regulatory cell-mediated control, thus promoting a powerful immuno-pathological T-cell response. On the other hand, gut butyrate has been reported to inhibit local pro-inflammatory cytokines. The absence or depletion of these BPB in the gut could therefore be a possible aide in the overly-active inflammatory response. Butyrate in the gut also protects the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Decreased butyrate levels therefore lead to a damaged or dysfunctional intestinal epithelial barrier.\n\nIn a 2013 research study conducted by Furusawa et al, microbe-derived butyrate was found to be essential in inducing the differentiation of colonic regulatory T-cells in mice. \tThis is of great importance and possibly relevant to the pathogenesis and vasculitis associated with many inflammatory diseases because regulatory T-cells have a central role in the suppression of inflammatory and allergic responses. In several research studies, it has been demonstrated that butyrate induced the differentiation of regulatory T-cells in vitro and in vivo.\n\nThe anti-inflammatory capacity of butyrate has been extensively analyzed and supported by many studies. It has been found that microorganism-produced butyrate expedites the production of regulatory T-cells. An increase in regulatory T-cell numbers was observed upon a butyrate provision. More recently, it has been shown that butyrate plays an essential and direct role in modulating gene expression of cytotoxic T-cells. Although specific mechanism by which butyrate aids in the differentiation of T-cells is unclear, it has been determined that butyrate promotes the generation of regulatory T-cells.\n\nPotential Treatments for Butyrate Restoration\n\nDue to the importance of butyrate as an inflammatory regulator and immune system contributor, butyrate depletions could be a key factor influencing the pathogenesis of many vasculitic conditions. Because of this, it is essential to harvest healthy levels of butyrate in the gut. Butyrate provisions or fecal microbiota transplants (to restore BPB and symbiosis in the gut) could be effective in replenishing butyrate levels. A fecal microbiota transplant, also known as fecal bacteriotherapy, is the process of restoring bacteria commonly found in the digestive tract with an infusion of feces from a donor. While the description of this may disgust some, fecal bacteriotherapy may quickly and efficiently restore symbiosis in imbalanced microbiomes. In this treatment option, a healthy individual would donate their stool to be transplanted into an individual with dysbiosis. Another less-invasive treatment option that may be effective in decreasing inflammation in individuals with vasculitic conditions is the administration of butyrate. This could be as easy as buying oral butyrate supplements online. Another way to administer butyrate into the gut—which many be more effective though also more invasive—is by the administration of butyrate enemas. Butyrate—both oral supplements and enemas—has been shown to be very effective in terminating symptoms of inflammation with minimal-to-no side-effects. In a study where patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with butyrate enemas, inflammation decreased significantly, and bleeding ceased completely after butyrate provision Scheppach, W., Sommer, H., Kirchner, T., Paganelli, G. M., Bartram, P., Christl, S., … Kasper, H. (1992). Effect of butyrate enemas on the colonic mucosa in distal ulcerative colitis. Gastroenterology. http://doi.org/10.1016/0016-5085(92)91094-K.\n\nSynthetic butyrates\nA variety of butyrate esters are known.  Examples include:\n Cellulose acetate butyrate, an aircraft dope\n Methyl butyrate\n Ethyl butyrate\n Butyl butyrate\n Pentyl butyrate\n\nSalts of butyrates are also well known.  One example is sodium butyrate, a colorless, water-soluble salt.  It is a HDAC inhibitor used in psychiatry.\n\nSee also\n Butyric acid\n\nReferences\n\n \nCategory:Carboxylate anions"

      "text": "In mathematics, the cardinality of a set is a measure of the \"number of elements of the set\". For example, the set  contains 3 elements, and therefore  has a cardinality of 3. There are two approaches to cardinality – one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers.\nThe cardinality of a set is also called its size, when no confusion with other notions of sizeSuch as length and area in geometry. – A line of finite length is a set of points that has infinite cardinality. is possible.\n\nThe cardinality of a set  is usually denoted , with a vertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context. Alternatively, the cardinality of a set  may be denoted by , , , or .\n\nComparing sets\nWhile the cardinality of a finite set is just the number of its elements, extending the notion to infinite sets usually starts with defining the notion of comparison of arbitrary (possibly infinite) sets.\n\nthumb|150px|Bijective function from N to E. Although E is a proper subset of N, both sets have the same cardinality.\n\nDefinition 1:  = \nTwo sets A and B have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection from A to B, that is, a function from A to B that is both injective and surjective. Such sets are said to be equipotent, equipollent, or equinumerous. This relationship can also be denoted A ≈ B or A ~ B.\n\nFor example, the set E = {0, 2, 4, 6, ...} of non-negative even numbers has the same cardinality as the set N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} of natural numbers, since the function f(n) = 2n is a bijection from N to E.\n\nDefinition 2:  ≤ \nA has cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of B if there exists an injective function from A into B.\n\nDefinition 3:  < \nA has cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of B if there is an injective function, but no bijective function, from A to B.\n\nFor example, the set N of all natural numbers has cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of the set R of all real numbers , because the inclusion map i : N → R is injective, but it can be shown that there does not exist a bijective function from N to R (see Cantor's diagonal argument or Cantor's first uncountability proof).\n\nIf  ≤  and  ≤  then  =  (Schröder–Bernstein theorem). The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that  ≤  or  ≤  for every A, B. - Original edition (1914)\n\nCardinal numbers\n\nAbove, \"cardinality\" was defined functionally. That is, the \"cardinality\" of a set was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.\n\nThe relation of having the same cardinality is called equinumerosity, and this is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets. The equivalence class of a set A under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as A. There are two ways to define the \"cardinality of a set\":\n\nThe cardinality of a set A is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity.\nA representative set is designated for each equivalence class. The most common choice is the initial ordinal in that class. This is usually taken as the definition of cardinal number in axiomatic set theory.\n\nAssuming AC, the cardinalities of the infinite sets are denoted\n\nFor each ordinal ,  is the least cardinal number greater than .\n\nThe cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph-null (), while the cardinality of the real numbers is denoted by \"\" (a lowercase fraktur script \"c\"), and is also referred to as the cardinality of the continuum. Cantor showed, using the diagonal argument, that . We can show that , this also being the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers. The continuum hypothesis says that , i.e.  is the smallest cardinal number bigger than , i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers.\nThe continuum hypothesis is independent of ZFC, a standard axiomatization of set theory; that is, it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC (provided ZFC is consistent). See below for more details on the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nFinite, countable and uncountable sets\nIf the axiom of choice holds, the law of trichotomy holds for cardinality. Thus we can make the following definitions:\n\nAny set X with cardinality less than that of the natural numbers, or | X | < | N |, is said to be a finite set.\nAny set X that has the same cardinality as the set of the natural numbers, or | X | = | N | = , is said to be a countably infinite set.\nAny set X with cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers, or | X | > | N |, for example | R | =  > | N |, is said to be  uncountable.\n\nInfinite sets\nOur intuition gained from finite sets breaks down when dealing with infinite sets. In the late nineteenth century Georg Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others rejected the view that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. One example of this is Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel.\nIndeed, Dedekind defined an infinite set as one that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with a strict subset (that is, having the same size in Cantor's sense); this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite. Cantor introduced the cardinal numbers, and showed that (according to his bijection-based definition of size) some infinite sets are greater than others. The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers ().\n\nCardinality of the continuum\n\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum () is greater than that of the natural numbers (); that is, there are more real numbers R than natural numbers N. Namely, Cantor showed that  (see Beth one) satisfies:\n\n(see Cantor's diagonal argument or Cantor's first uncountability proof).\n\nThe continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,\n\nHowever, this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted ZFC axiomatic set theory, if ZFC is consistent.\n\nCardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. These results are highly counterintuitive, because they imply that there exist proper subsets and proper supersets of an infinite set S that have the same size as S, although S contains elements that do not belong to its subsets, and the supersets of S contain elements that are not included in it.\n\nThe first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (−½π, ½π) and R (see also Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel).\n\nThe second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in 1878, but it became more apparent in 1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite-dimensional space, but they can be used to obtain such a proof.\n\nCantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than  exist (see his generalized diagonal argument and theorem). They include, for instance:\n\n the set of all subsets of R, i.e., the power set of R, written P(R) or 2R\n the set RR of all functions from R to R\n\nBoth have cardinality\n\n(see Beth two).\n\nThe cardinal equalities   and  can be demonstrated using cardinal arithmetic:\n\nExamples and properties\n If X = {a, b, c} and Y = {apples, oranges, peaches}, then | X | = | Y | because { (a, apples), (b, oranges), (c, peaches)} is a bijection between the sets X and Y. The cardinality of each of X and Y is 3.\n If | X | < | Y |, then there exists Z such that | X | = | Z | and Z ⊆ Y.\nIf | X | ≤ | Y | and | Y | ≤ | X |, then | X | = | Y |. This holds even for infinite cardinals, and is known as Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem.\n Sets with cardinality of the continuum\n\nUnion and intersection\n\nIf A and B are disjoint sets, then\n\nFrom this, one can show that in general the cardinalities of unions and  intersections are related byApplied Abstract Algebra, K.H.

      "text": "Charles Sanders Peirce (,\"Peirce\", in the case of C. S. Peirce, always rhymes with the English-language word \"terse\" and so, in most dialects, is pronounced exactly like the English-language word \"\". ; September 10, 1839 – April 19, 1914) was an American philosopher, logician, mathematician, and scientist who is sometimes known as \"the father of pragmatism\". He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for thirty years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism.\n\nAn innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself, first and foremost, a logician. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th century Western philosophy. Additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulated mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. As early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. The same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers. See  Also \n\nIn 1934, the philosopher Paul Weiss called Peirce \"the most original and versatile of American philosophers and America's greatest logician\". Webster's Biographical Dictionary said in 1943 that Peirce was \"now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time\". Keith Devlin similarly referred to Peirce as one of the greatest philosophers ever.\n\nLife\nthumb|left|upright=1.25|Peirce's birthplace. Now part of Lesley University's Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences\n\nPeirce was born at 3 Phillips Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and Benjamin Peirce, himself a professor of astronomy and mathematics at Harvard University and perhaps the first serious research mathematician in America. At age 12, Charles read his older brother's copy of Richard Whately's Elements of Logic, then the leading English-language text on the subject. So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning.Fisch, Max, \"Introduction\", Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 1:xvii, find phrase \"One episode\". He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degree (1862) from Harvard. In 1863 the Lawrence Scientific School awarded him a Bachelor of Science degree, Harvard's first summa cum laude chemistry degree.\"Peirce, Charles Sanders\" (1898), The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, v. 8, p. 409. His academic record was otherwise undistinguished. At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Chauncey Wright, and William James. One of his Harvard instructors, Charles William Eliot, formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard (1869–1909—a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life—repeatedly vetoed Peirce'e employment at the university.\n\nPeirce suffered from his late-teens onward from a nervous condition then known as \"facial neuralgia\", which would today be diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. His biographer, Joseph Brent, says that when in the throes of its pain \"he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper\". Its consequences may have led to the social isolation which made his life's later years so tragic.\n\nEarly employment\nBetween 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the United States Coast Survey and its successor, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,Burch, Robert (2001, 2010), \"Charles Sanders Peirce\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy where he enjoyed his highly influential father's protection until the latter's death in 1880. That employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the American Civil War; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the Boston Brahmin Peirces sympathized with the Confederacy. At the Survey, he worked mainly in geodesy and gravimetry, refining the use of pendulums to determine small local variations in the Earth's gravity. He was elected a resident fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in January 1867. The Survey sent him to Europe five times, first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a solar eclipse. There, he sought out Augustus De Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, and William Kingdon Clifford, British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own. From 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an Assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of stars and the shape of the Milky Way.Moore, Edward C., and Robin, Richard S., eds., (1964), Studies in the Philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce, Second Series, Amherst: U. of Massachusetts Press. On Peirce the astronomer, see Lenzen's chapter. On April 20, 1877 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the meter as so many wavelengths of light of a certain frequency,Fisch, Max (1983), \"Peirce as Scientist, mathematician, historian, Logician, and Philosopher\", Studies in Logic (new edition), see p. x. the kind of definition employed from 1960 to 1983.\n\nDuring the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months. Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands during 1883–1909, on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic Century Dictionary.See \"Peirce Edition Project (UQÀM) – in short \" from PEP-UQÀM. In 1885, an investigation by the Allison Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent Julius Hilgard and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds.Houser, Nathan, \"Introduction\", Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 5:xxviii–xxix, find \"Allison\". In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent Thomas Corwin Mendenhall's request. He never again held regular employment.\n\nJohns Hopkins University\nIn 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at Johns Hopkins University, which had strong departments in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy (Royce and Dewey completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by G. Stanley Hall and studied by Joseph Jastrow, who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by J. J. Sylvester, who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). His Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University (1883) contained works by himself and Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd, Benjamin Ives Gilman, and Oscar Howard Mitchell, several of whom were his graduate students.Houser, Nathan (1989), \"Introduction\",  Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 4:xxxviii, find \"Eighty-nine\". Peirce's nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held.\n\nBrent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, Simon Newcomb. Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as \"his difficult personality\". Conversely, Keith Devlin believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.\n\nPeirce's personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay (\"Zina\"), left him in 1875, Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with Juliette, whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai, and nationality (she spoke French) remains uncertain.Houser, Nathan, \"Introduction\", Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 6, first paragraph. When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette. That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884. Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success.In 1885 (); in 1890 and 1900 (p. 273); in 1891 (pp. 215–16); and in 1892 (pp. 151–52, 222). He had no children by either marriage.\n\nPoverty\nthumb|left|Arisbe in 2011\nframe|Cambridge, where Peirce was born and raised, New York City, where he often visited and sometimes lived, and Milford, where he spent the later years of his life with his second wife Juliette. \nthumb|upright=1.25|Juliette and Charles by a well at their home Arisbe in 1907\nthumb|Charles and Juliette Peirce's grave\n\nIn 1887 Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy  of rural land near Milford, Pennsylvania, which never yielded an economic return. There he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design. The Peirces named the property \"Arisbe\". There they lived with few interruptions for the rest of their lives, Charles writing prolifically, much of it unpublished to this day (see Works). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties. He spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while. Several people, including his brother James Mills Peirce and his neighbors, relatives of Gifford Pinchot, settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.\n\nPeirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay, mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries, and reviews for The Nation (with whose editor, Wendell Phillips Garrison, he became friendly). He did translations for the Smithsonian Institution, at its director Samuel Langley's instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley's research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing. He began but did not complete a number of books. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland appointed him to the Assay Commission.\n\nFrom 1890 on, he had a friend and admirer in Judge Francis C. Russell of Chicago, who introduced Peirce to editor Paul Carus and owner Edward C. Hegeler of the pioneering American philosophy journal The Monist, which eventually published at least 14 articles by Peirce. He wrote many texts in James Mark Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology (1901–1905); half of those credited to him appear to have been written actually by Christine Ladd-Franklin under his supervision. He applied in 1902 to the newly formed Carnegie Institution for a grant to write a systematic book of his life's work. The application was doomed; his nemesis, Newcomb, served on the Institution's executive committee, and its President had been the President of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce's dismissal.\n\nThe one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend William James, dedicating his Will to Believe (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903). Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him. It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used \"Santiago\" (\"St. James\" in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce for discussion and references).\n\nPeirce died destitute in Milford, Pennsylvania, twenty years before his widow. Juliette Peirce kept the urn with Peirce's ashes at Arisbe. In 1934, Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot arranged for Juliette's burial on Milford Cemetery. The urn with Peirce's ashes was interred with Juliette.In 2018, plans have been made to erect a memorial monument for Peirce at the site of burial – see: Justin Weinberg, 'A Proper Memorial Monument for Peirce', website Daily Nous, March 14, 2018.\n\nSlavery, the American Civil War, and racism\nPeirce grew up in a home where the supremacy of the white Anglo-Saxon male was taken for granted and Negro slavery was considered natural.\n\nUntil the outbreak of the Civil War his father described himself as a secessionist, but after the outbreak of the war, this stopped and he became a Union partisan, providing donations to the Sanitary Commission, the leading Northern war charity. No members of the Peirce family volunteered or enlisted. Peirce shared his father's views and liked to use the following syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic (see also: ):\n\nAll Men are equal in their political rights.\nNegroes are Men.\nTherefore, negroes are equal in political rights to whites.\n\nReception\nBertrand Russell (1959) wrote \"Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century and certainly the greatest American thinker ever\".Russell, Bertrand (1959), Wisdom of the West, p. 276 Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, published from 1910 to 1913, do not mention Peirce (Peirce's work was not widely known until later).Anellis, Irving H. (1995), \"Peirce Rustled, Russell Pierced: How Charles Peirce and Bertrand Russell Viewed Each Other's Work in Logic, and an Assessment of Russell's Accuracy and Role in the Historiography of Logic\", Modern Logic 5, 270–328. Arisbe Eprint A. N. Whitehead, while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own \"process\" thinking. (On Peirce and process metaphysics, see Lowe 1964). Karl Popper viewed Peirce as \"one of the greatest philosophers of all times\".Popper, Karl (1972), Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, p. 212 Yet Peirce's achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries William James and Josiah RoyceSee Royce, Josiah, and Kernan, W. Fergus (1916), \"Charles Sanders Peirce\", The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Method v. 13, pp. 701–09. Arisbe Eprint admired him and Cassius Jackson Keyser, at Columbia and C. K. Ogden, wrote about Peirce with respect but to no immediate effect.\n\nThe first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce's student Morris Raphael Cohen, the editor of an anthology of Peirce's writings titled Chance, Love, and Logic (1923), and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings.Ketner et al. (1986), Comprehensive Bibliography, p. iii John Dewey, studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins. From 1916 onward, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 Logic: The Theory of Inquiry is much influenced by Peirce.Hookway, Christopher (2008), \"Pragmatism\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The publication of the first six volumes of Collected Papers (1931–1935), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds, did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss, did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and Goudge (1950), the 1941 PhD thesis by Arthur W. Burks (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Its Transactions, an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce's pragmatism and American philosophy has appeared since 1965. (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to transactionalism).\n\nIn 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics Carolyn Eisele (1902–2000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her forty years of research on Peirce, 'the mathematician and scientist', culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). Beginning around 1960, the philosopher and historian of ideas Max Fisch (1900–1995) emerged as an authority on Peirce (Fisch, 1986).Fisch, Max (1986), Peirce, Semeiotic, and Pragmatism, Kenneth Laine Ketner and Christian J. W. Kloesel, eds., Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana U. Press. He includes many of his relevant articles in a survey (Fisch 1986: 422–48) of the impact of Peirce's thought through 1983.\n\nPeirce has gained a significant international following, marked by university research centers devoted to Peirce studies and pragmatism in Brazil (CeneP/CIEP), Finland (HPRC and ), Germany (Wirth's group, Hoffman's and Otte's group, and Deuser's and Härle's groupTheological Research Group in C.S. Peirce's Philosophy (Hermann Deuser, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen; Wilfred Härle, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany).), France (L'I.R.S.C.E.), Spain (GEP), and Italy (CSP). His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish, British, and Brazilian Peirce scholars of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the University of Toronto, thanks in part to the leadership of Thomas Goudge and David Savan. In recent years, U.S. Peirce scholars have clustered at Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis, home of the Peirce Edition Project (PEP) –, and Pennsylvania State University.\n\nIn recent years, Peirce's trichotomy of signs is exploited by a growing number of practitioners for marketing and design tasks.\n\nWorks\nPeirce's reputation rests largely on a number of academic papers published in American scientific and scholarly journals such as Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, The Monist, Popular Science Monthly, the American Journal of Mathematics, Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences, The Nation, and others. See Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime for an extensive list with links to them online. The only full-length book (neither extract nor pamphlet) that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetimeBurks, Arthur, Introduction, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 7, p. xi. was Photometric Researches (1878), a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy. While at Johns Hopkins, he edited Studies in Logic (1883), containing chapters by himself and his graduate students. Besides lectures during his years (1879–1884) as lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least nine series of lectures, many now published; see Lectures by Peirce.\n\nAfter Peirce's death, Harvard University obtained from Peirce's widow the papers found in his study, but did not microfilm them until 1964. Only after Richard Robin (1967)Robin, Richard S. (1967), Annotated Catalogue of the Papers of Charles S. Peirce.

It can be tessellated, that is, multiple copies can be joined together continuously edge-to-edge.Peirce's most important work in pure mathematics was in logical and foundational areas. He also worked on linear algebra, matrices, various geometries, topology and Listing numbers, Bell numbers, graphs, the four-color problem, and the nature of continuity.\n\nHe worked on applied mathematics in economics, engineering, and map projections (such as the Peirce quincuncial projection), and was especially active in probability and statistics.Burks, Arthur W., \"Review: Charles S.

Peirce. he set out the axiomatization of natural number arithmetic, a few years before Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano. In the same paper Peirce gave, years before Dedekind, the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as \"Dedekind-finite\", and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an infinite set (Dedekind-infinite), as a set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets.\n\nIn 1885Peirce (1885), \"On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation\", American Journal of Mathematics 7, two parts, first part published 1885, pp. 180–202 (see Houser in linked paragraph in \"Introduction\" in Writings of Charles S.

Based on them are John F. Sowa's conceptual graphs and Sun-Joo Shin's diagrammatic reasoning.\n\nThe New Elements of Mathematics\n\nPeirce wrote drafts for an introductory textbook, with the working title The New Elements of Mathematics, that presented mathematics from an original standpoint. Those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared in The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce (1976), edited by mathematician Carolyn Eisele.\n\nNature of mathematics\n\nPeirce agreed with Auguste Comte in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce classified mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the real numbers) and continua. Influenced by his father Benjamin, Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science about drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.Peirce (1898), \"The Logic of Mathematics in Relation to Education\" in Educational Review v. 15, pp. 209–16 (via Internet Archive).

Much of the mathematics of relations now taken for granted was \"borrowed\" from Peirce, not always with all due credit; on that and on how the young Bertrand Russell, especially his Principles of Mathematics and Principia Mathematica, did not do Peirce justice, see Anellis (1995). In 1918 the logician C. I. Lewis wrote, \"The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer—at least in the nineteenth century.\"Lewis, Clarence Irving (1918), A Survey of Symbolic Logic, see ch. 1, §7 \"Peirce\", pp. 79–106, see p. 79 (Internet Archive). Note that Lewis's bibliography lists works by Frege, tagged with asterisks as important. Beginning in 1940, Alfred Tarski and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce's larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of relation algebra.\n\nRelational logic gained applications. In mathematics, it influenced the abstract analysis of E. H. Moore and the lattice theory of Garrett Birkhoff. In computer science, the relational model for databases was developed with Peircean ideas in work of Edgar F. Codd, who was a doctoral studentAvery, John (2003) Information theory and evolution, p. 167; also Mitchell, Melanie, \"My Scientific Ancestry\". of Arthur W. Burks, a Peirce scholar. In economics, relational logic was used by Frank P. Ramsey, John von Neumann, and Paul Samuelson to study preferences and utility and by Kenneth J. Arrow in Social Choice and Individual Values, following Arrow's association with Tarski at City College of New York.\n\nOn Peirce and his contemporaries Ernst Schröder and Gottlob Frege, Hilary Putnam (1982)Putnam, Hilary (1982), \"Peirce the Logician\", Historia Mathematica 9, 290–301.

Excerpt with article's last five pages. documented that Frege's work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries, although it was published four years before the work of Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell. Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce's \"On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation\" (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by Peano and Schröder, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce's notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, philosophy of language, and the foundations of mathematics.\n\nPeirce's work on formal logic had admirers besides Ernst Schröder:\n Philosophical algebraist William Kingdon CliffordBeil, Ralph G. and Ketner, Kenneth (2003), \"Peirce, Clifford, and Quantum Theory\", International Journal of Theoretical Physics v. 42, n. 9, pp. 1957–72. and logician William Ernest Johnson, both British;\n The Polish school of logic and foundational mathematics, including Alfred Tarski;\n Arthur Prior, who praised and studied Peirce's logical work in a 1964 paper and in Formal Logic (saying on page 4 that Peirce \"perhaps had a keener eye for essentials than any other logician before or since\").\n\nA philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings and, along with Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982); the Introduction in Nathan Houser et al. (1997);Houser, Roberts, and Van Evra, eds. (1997), Studies in the Logic of Charles Sanders Peirce, Indiana U., Bloomington, IN. and Randall Dipert's chapter in Cheryl Misak (2004).Misak, ed. (2004), The Cambridge Companion to Peirce, Cambridge U., UK.\n\nContinua\nContinuity and synechism are central in Peirce's philosophy: \"I did not at first suppose that it was, as I gradually came to find it, the master-Key of philosophy\".Peirce (1893–1894, MS 949, p. 1)\n\nFrom a mathematical point of view, he embraced infinitesimals and worked long on the mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum;Peirce (1903 MS), Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 6.176: \"But I now define a pseudo-continuum as that which modern writers on the theory of functions call a continuum. But this is fully represented by [...] the totality of real values, rational and irrational [...].\" that a true continuum is the real subject matter of analysis situs (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any Aleph number (any infinite multitude as he called it) of instants.Peirce (1902 MS) and Ransdell, Joseph, ed. (1998), \"Analysis of the Methods of Mathematical Demonstration\", Memoir 4, Draft C, MS L75.90–102, see 99–100. (Once there, scroll down).\n\nIn 1908 Peirce wrote that he found that a true continuum might have or lack such room. Jérôme Havenel (2008): \"It is on 26 May 1908, that Peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude. From now on, there are different kinds of continua, which have different properties.\"See:\n Peirce (1908), \"Some Amazing Mazes (Conclusion), Explanation of Curiosity the First\", The Monist, v. 18, n. 3, pp. 416–44, see 463-64.

Abstract.\n\nProbability and statistics\nPeirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that spontaneity (absolute chance) is real (see Tychism on his view). Most of his statistical writings promote the frequency interpretation of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) probability when such models are not based on objective randomization.Peirce condemned the use of \"certain likelihoods\" (The Essential Peirce, 2:108–09) even more strongly than he criticized Bayesian methods. Indeed Peirce used a bit of Bayesian inference in criticizing parapsychology (Writings of Charles S. Pierce, 6:76). Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his possible world semantics introduced the \"propensity\" theory of probability before Karl Popper.Miller, Richard W. (1975), \"Propensity: Popper or Peirce?\", British Journal for the Philosophy of Science (site), v. 26, n. 2, pp. 123–32. . Eprint.Haack, Susan and Kolenda, Konstantin (1977), \"Two Fallibilists in Search of the Truth\",  Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes, v. 51, pp. 63–104.  Peirce (sometimes with Joseph Jastrow) investigated the probability judgments of experimental subjects, \"perhaps the very first\" elicitation and estimation of subjective probabilities in experimental psychology and (what came to be called) Bayesian statistics.\n\nPeirce was one of the founders of statistics. He formulated modern statistics in \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" (1877–1878) and \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (1883). With a repeated measures design, Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow introduced blinded, controlled randomized experiments in 1884Peirce CS, Jastrow J. On Small Differences in Sensation. Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences 1885; 3:73–83. (Hacking 1990:205) (before Ronald A. Fisher). He invented optimal design for experiments on gravity, in which he \"corrected the means\". He used correlation and smoothing. Peirce extended the work on outliers by Benjamin Peirce, his father. He introduced terms \"confidence\" and \"likelihood\" (before Jerzy Neyman and Fisher). (See Stephen Stigler's historical books and Ian Hacking 1990).\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPeirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including mathematics, logic, philosophy, statistics, astronomy, metrology, geodesy, experimental psychology, economics, linguistics, and the history and philosophy of science. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.\n\nPeirce's philosophy includes (see below in related sections) a pervasive three-category system, belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion (fallibilism) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways—including philosophical pragmatism (which he founded), critical common-sensism, and scientific method—and, in metaphysics: Scholastic realism, e.g. John Duns Scotus, belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, objective idealism, and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love.  In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like skepticism and positivism, respectively, in others' work.  However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an anti-skepticism and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity,Peirce (1897) \"Fallibilism, Continuity, and Evolution\", Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.141–75 (Eprint), placed by the Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, editors directly after \"F.R.L.\" (1899, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.135–40). and pragmatism commits one to anti-nominalist belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453–57).\n\nFor Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences.Peirce (1903), Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.180–202 and (1906) \"The Basis of Pragmaticism\", The Essential Peirce, 2:372–73, see \"Philosophy\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. He divided such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.\n\nTheory of categories\n\nOn May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled \"On a New List of Categories\" to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, and G. W. F. Hegel, categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life. Peirce scholars generally regard the \"New List\" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's \"architectonic\", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in \"How To Make Our Ideas Clear\" (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.\n\n\"On a New List of Categories\" is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.See in \"Firstness\", \"Secondness\", and \"Thirdness\" in Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. In 1893, Peirce restated most of it for a less advanced audience.Peirce (1893), \"The Categories\" MS 403. Arisbe Eprint, edited by Joseph Ransdell, with information on the re-write, and interleaved with the 1867 \"New List\" for comparison. \n\nAesthetics and ethics\nPeirce did not write extensively in aesthetics and ethics,\"Charles S. Peirce on Esthetics and Ethics: A Bibliography \" (PDF) by Kelly A. Parker in 1999. but came by 1902 to hold that aesthetics, ethics, and logic, in that order, comprise the normative sciences.Peirce (1902 MS), Carnegie Application, edited by Joseph Ransdell, Memoir 2, see table. He characterized aesthetics as the study of the good (grasped as the admirable), and thus of the ends governing all conduct and thought.See Esthetics at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce.\n\nPhilosophy: logic, or semiotic\n\nLogic as philosophical\nPeirce regarded logic per se as a division of philosophy, as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,Peirce (1899 MS), \"F.R.L.\" [First Rule of Logic], Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.135–40, Eprint and as \"the art of devising methods of research\".Peirce (1882), \"Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic\" delivered September 1882, Johns Hopkins University Circulars, v. 2, n. 19, pp. 11–12 (via Google), November 1882. Reprinted (The Essential Peirce, 1:210–14; Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 4:378–82; Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 7.59–76). The definition of logic quoted by Peirce is by Peter of Spain. More generally, as inference, \"logic is rooted in the social principle\", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.Peirce (1878), \"The Doctrine of Chances\", Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 604–15 (CP 2.645–68, Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 3:276–90, The Essential Peirce, 1:142–154).  Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) \"mathematics of logic\" much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply \"logic\". He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.\n\nPeirce argued that logic is formal semiotic, the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that \"all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs\",Peirce, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.448 footnote, from \"The Basis of Pragmaticism\" in 1906. along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signsPeirce, (1868), \"Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man\", Journal of Speculative Philosophy v. 2, n. 2, pp. 103–14. On thought in signs, see p. 112. Reprinted Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.213–63 (on thought in signs, see 253), Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 2:193–211, The Essential Peirce, 2:11–27. Arisbe Eprint. and sign processes (\"semiosis\") such as the inquiry process. He divided logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or universal rhetoric, or methodeutic, the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.\n\nPresuppositions of logic\nIn his \"F.R.L.\" [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and \"in one sense, the sole\", rule of reason is that, to learn, one needs to desire to learn and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think. So, the first rule is, to wonder. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:\n...there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:\nDo not block the way of inquiry.\nPeirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that \"the one unpardonable offence\" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which \"metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted\". Peirce in many writings holds that logic precedes metaphysics (ontological, religious, and physical).\n\nPeirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of fallibilism, which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real (tychism and synechism).\n\nThe First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough (see below). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.Peirce (1902), The Carnegie Institute Application, Memoir 10, MS L75.361–62, Arisbe Eprint.\n\nFour incapacities\nThe Journal of Speculative Philosophy series (1868–1869), including\n Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man (1868)\n Some Consequences of Four Incapacities (1868)\n Grounds of Validity of the Laws of Logic: Further Consequences of Four Incapacities (1869) In three articles in 1868–1869,Peirce (1868), \"Some Consequences of Four Incapacities\", Journal of Speculative Philosophy v. 2, n. 3, pp. 140–57.

Peirce rejected mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt and first or ultimate principles, and argued that we have (as he numbered them):\n No power of Introspection. All knowledge of the internal world comes by hypothetical reasoning from known external facts.\n No power of Intuition (cognition without logical determination by previous cognitions). No cognitive stage is absolutely first in a process. All mental action has the form of inference.\n No power of thinking without signs. A cognition must be interpreted in a subsequent cognition in order to be a cognition at all.\n No conception of the absolutely incognizable.\n(The above sense of the term \"intuition\" is almost Kant's, said Peirce. It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)\n\nPeirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning, and the falsity of philosophical Cartesianism (see below).\n\nPeirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself and later said that to \"dismiss make-believes\" is a prerequisite for pragmatism.Peirce (1905), \"What Pragmatism Is\", The Monist, v. XV, n. 2, pp. 161–81, see 167. Reprinted Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.411–37, see 416. Arisbe Eprint.\n\nLogic as formal semiotic\nPeirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods. Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in Aristotle's work, in such loci as: the basic terminology of psychology in On the Soul; the founding description of sign relations in On Interpretation; and the differentiation of inference into three modes that are commonly translated into English as abduction, deduction, and induction, in the Prior Analytics, as well as inference by analogy (called paradeigma by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.\n\nPeirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both semiotic and semeiotic. Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic sign relation, and defined semiosis as \"action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of three subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs\".Peirce 1907, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.484. Reprinted, The Essential Peirce, 2:411 in \"Pragmatism\" (398–433). As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse: \"To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.\"\n\nPeirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where sign is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or quasi-mind, that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or beesSee \"Quasi-mind\" in Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce.—the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued).\n\nInquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:\n\n Conditions for meaningfulness. Study of significatory elements and combinations, their grammar.\n Validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various separate modes.\n Conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.\n\nPeirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:\n\nSigns\n \nA list of noted writings by Peirce on signs and sign relations is at Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce § References and further reading.\n\nSign relation\nPeirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign—not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The sign relation is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its object, and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its interpretant (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible triadic relation, according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.\n\nExtension × intension = information. Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of extension (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of intension (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of information, including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.Peirce (1867), \"Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension\" (CP 2.391–426), (Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 2:70–86). For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.\n\nDetermination. A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object—the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object—an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something as a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experienceSee pp. 404–09 in \"Pragmatism\" in The Essential Peirce, 2. Ten quotes on collateral experience from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed here at peirce-l's Lyris archive. Note: Ransdell's quotes from Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 8.178–79 are also in The Essential Peirce, 2:493–94, which gives their date as 1909; and his quote from Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 8.183 is also in The Essential Peirce, 2:495–96, which gives its date as 1909. with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word \"determine\" not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of \"specializes\", bestimmt,Peirce, letter to William James, dated 1909, see The Essential Peirce, 2:492. involving variable amount, like an influence.See \"76 definitions of the sign by C.S.Peirce\", collected by Robert Marty (U. of Perpignan, France). Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination.Peirce, A Letter to Lady Welby (1908), Semiotic and Significs, pp. 80–81:  The object determines the sign to determine another sign—the interpretant—to be related to the object as the sign is related to the object, hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.\n\nSemiotic elements\nPeirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):\n A sign (or representamen)Representamen ( ) was adopted (not coined) by Peirce as his technical term for the sign as covered in his theory, in case a divergence should come to light between his theoretical version and the popular senses of the word \"sign\". He eventually stopped using \"representamen\". See The Essential Peirce, 2:272–73 and Semiotic and Significs p. 193, quotes in \"Representamen\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. represents, in the broadest possible sense of \"represents\". It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial—a cloud might be a sign of rain for instance, or ruins the sign of ancient civilization. As Peirce sometimes put it (he defined sign at least 76 times), the sign stands for the object to the interpretant. A sign represents its object in some respect, which respect is the sign's ground.\n An object (or semiotic object) is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as Prince Hamlet.Peirce (1909), A Letter to William James, The Essential Peirce, 2:492–502. Fictional object, 498. Object as universe of discourse, 492. See \"Dynamical Object\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the universe of discourse to which the partial or special object belongs. For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object either (i) is immediate to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a dynamic object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded \"as on bedrock\".See \"Immediate Object\", etc., at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce.\n An interpretant (or interpretant sign) is a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise. An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's \"predecessor\" (the interpreted sign) as a sign of the same object. An interpretant either (i) is immediate to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word's usual meaning, or (ii) is a dynamic interpretant, such as a state of agitation, or (iii) is a final or normal interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign would have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide.\nSome of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.\n\nClasses of signs\nAmong Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a trichotomy, via Peirce's three phenomenological categories: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.\n\nI. Qualisign, sinsign, legisign (also called tone, token, type, and also called potisign, actisign, famisign):On the varying terminology, look up in Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category—the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a \"First\"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a \"Second\"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a \"Third\".\n\nII. Icon, index, symbol: This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object—the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.\n\nIII. Rheme, dicisign, argument (also called sumisign, dicisign, suadisign, also seme, pheme, delome, and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional term, proposition, argument): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.\n\nEvery sign belongs to one class or another within (I) and within (II) and within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.\n\nModes of inference\n\nBorrowing a brace of concepts from Aristotle, Peirce examined three basic modes of inference—abduction, deduction, and induction—in his \"critique of arguments\" or \"logic proper\". Peirce also called abduction \"retroduction\", \"presumption\", and, earliest of all, \"hypothesis\". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical syllogism Barbara (AAA), for example in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" (1878).Popular Science Monthly, v. 13, pp. 470–82, see 472 or the book at Wikisource. Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 2.619–44 [623] He does this by rearranging the rule (Barbara's major premise), the case (Barbara's minor premise), and the result (Barbara's conclusion):\n\nDeduction.\n\nRule: All the beans from this bag are white. \nCase: These beans are beans from this bag. \n Result: These beans are white.\n\nInduction.\n\nCase: These beans are [randomly selected] from this bag. \nResult: These beans are white. \n Rule: All the beans from this bag are white.\n\nHypothesis (Abduction).\n\nRule: All the beans from this bag are white. \nResult: These beans [oddly] are white. \n Case: These beans are from this bag.\n\nPeirce 1883 in \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (Studies in Logic) equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:See, under \"Abduction\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce, the following quotes:\n On correction of \"A Theory of Probable Inference\", see quotes from \"Minute Logic\", Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 2.102, c. 1902, and from the Carnegie Application (L75), 1902, Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science v. 2, pp. 1031–32.\n On new logical form for abduction, see quote from Harvard Lectures on Pragmatism, 1903, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.188–89.\nSee also Santaella, Lucia (1997) \"The Development of Peirce's Three Types of Reasoning: Abduction, Deduction, and Induction\", 6th Congress of the IASS. Eprint.\n\nThe logical form does not also cover induction, since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. \"Deduction proves that something must be; Induction shows that something actually is operative; Abduction merely suggests that something may be.\"\"Lectures on Pragmatism\", 1903, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.171. Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction.A Letter to J. H. Kehler (dated 1911), The New Elements of Mathematics v. 3, pp. 203–04, see in \"Retroduction\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. In his methodeutic or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing.\n\nPragmatism\n\nSome noted articles and lectures\n Illustrations of the Logic of Science (1877–1878): inquiry, pragmatism, statistics, inference\n The Fixation of Belief (1877)\n How to Make Our Ideas Clear (1878)\n The Doctrine of Chances (1878)\n The Probability of Induction (1878)\n The Order of Nature (1878)\n Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis (1878)\n The Harvard lectures on pragmatism (1903)\n What Pragmatism Is (1905)\n Issues of Pragmaticism (1905)\n Pragmatism (1907 MS in The Essential Peirce, 2) Peirce's recipe for pragmatic thinking, which he called pragmatism and, later, pragmaticism, is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called pragmatic maxim. Here is one of his more emphatic reiterations of it:\n\nAs a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, William James, and others in the Metaphysical Club. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as \"The Fixation of Belief\" (1877) and especially \"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\" (1878) as foundational to pragmatism.James, William (1897), The Will to Believe, see p. 124. Peirce (CP 5.11–12), like James (Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking, 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early John Dewey, in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.\n\nIn 1905 Peirce coined the new name pragmaticism \"for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\", saying that \"all went happily\" with James's and F.C.S. Schiller's variant uses of the old name \"pragmatism\" and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in \"literary journals, where it gets abused\". Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author Giovanni Papini's declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.See Pragmaticism#Pragmaticism's name for discussion and references.\n\nPragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series of articles. In the second one, \"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\", Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:\n Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.\n Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea \"distinct\", that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce called a likewise distinct definition \"nominal\" (CP 5.553).\n Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's conceived effects, such as fosters fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduced that which he later called the pragmatic maxim.\n\nBy way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. In clearness's second grade (the \"nominal\" grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which would be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.\"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\", in Peirce (1878 April), \"The Probability of Induction\", p. 718 (via Internet Archive ) in Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 705–18. Reprinted in Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 2.669–93, Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 3:290–305, The Essential Peirce, 1:155–69, elsewhere. Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.\n\nPeirce said that a conception's meaning consists in \"all general modes of rational conduct\" implied by \"acceptance\" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to \"vulgar\" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflectionPeirce (1902), Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.13 note 1. arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.See Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.34 Eprint (in \"The Spirit of Scholasticism\"), where Peirce ascribed the success of modern science less to a novel interest in verification than to the improvement of verification.\n\nPeirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness, is part of his theory of inquiry,See Joseph Ransdell's comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, Eprint which he variously called speculative, general, formal or universal rhetoric or simply methodeutic.See rhetoric definitions at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.\n\nTheory of inquiry\n\nCritical common-sensism\nCritical common-sensism,Peirce (1905), \"Issues of Pragmaticism\", The Monist, v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481–99. Reprinted Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.438–63. Also important: Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.497–525. treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.\n\nRival methods of inquiry\nIn \"The Fixation of Belief\" (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or hyperbolic doubt, which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:\n The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) – which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.\n The method of authority – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.\n The method of the a priori – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of \"what is agreeable to reason\". Thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.\n The method of science – wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion, such that, unlike in the other methods, inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong (fallibilism), not only right, and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.\n\nPeirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,Peirce, \"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life\", Lecture 1 of the 1898 Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1.616–48 in part and Reasoning and the Logic of Things, 105–22, reprinted in The Essential Peirce, 2:27–41. which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's \"first rule\" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. Scientific method excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive—eventually—at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth per se but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.\n\nScientific method\nInsofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: deduction from self-evident truths, or rationalism; and induction from experiential phenomena, or empiricism.\n\nBased on his critique of three modes of argument and different from either foundationalism or coherentism, Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:\n\n Active, abductive genesis of theory, with no prior assurance of truth;\n Deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications;\n Inductive testing and evaluation of the utility of the provisional theory in anticipation of future experience, in both senses: prediction and control.\n\nThereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization simpliciter, which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the scientific method was proposed as an epistemology for philosophical questions.\n\nA theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.\n\nPeirce extracted the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.\n\nAbduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components.\n\nPeirce's outline of the scientific method in §III–IV of \"A Neglected Argument\"Peirce (1908), \"A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God\", published in large part, Hibbert Journal v. 7, 90–112. Reprinted with an unpublished part, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 6.452–85, Selected Writings pp. 358–79, The Essential Peirce, 2:434–50, Peirce on Signs 260–78. is summarized below (except as otherwise noted). There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of critique of arguments).\n\n1. Abductive (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\".See also Nubiola, Jaime (2004), \"Il Lume Naturale: Abduction and God\", Semiotiche I/2, 91–102. Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths.Peirce (c. 1906), \"PAP (Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism)\" (MS 293), The New Elements of Mathematics v. 4, pp. 319–20, first quote under \"Abduction\" at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. In 1903, Peirce called pragmatism \"the logic of abduction\".Peirce (1903), \"Pragmatism – The Logic of Abduction\", Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 5.195–205, especially 196. Eprint. Coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testabilityPeirce, Carnegie application, MS L75.279–80: Memoir 27, Draft B. and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.See MS L75.329–30, from Draft D of Memoir 27 of Peirce's application to the Carnegie Institution:  The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of Twenty Questions), breadth, or incomplexity.Peirce, C. S., \"On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents\", The Essential Peirce, 2, see pp. 107–09. On Twenty Questions, see 109:  One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so the point is to expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.\n\n2. Deductive phase. Two stages:\ni. Explication. Not clearly premised, but a deductive analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible.\nii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, Euclidean in procedure. Explicit deduction of consequences of the hypothesis as predictions about evidence to be found. Corollarial or, if needed, Theorematic.\n\n3. Inductive phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real \"is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\"; in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows \"a method which, sufficiently persisted in\", will \"diminish the error below any predesignate degree\". Three stages:\ni. Classification. Not clearly premised, but an inductive classing of objects of experience under general ideas.\nii. Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation. Crude or Gradual in procedure. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 7.114–20). Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of S, S is found actually accompanied by P that was predicted for S (CP 2.758). It depends on measurements, or statistics, or counting.\niii. Sentential Induction. \"...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result\".\n\nAgainst Cartesianism\nPeirce drew on the methodological implications of the four incapacities—no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable—to attack philosophical Cartesianism, of which he said that:\n\n1. \"It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt\" – when, instead, we start with preconceptions, \"prejudices [...] which it does not occur to us can be questioned\", though we may find reason to question them later. \"Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts.\"\n\n2. \"It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is...in the individual consciousness\" – when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left. No lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophy's multi-generational dream. When \"candid and disciplined minds\" continue to disagree on a theoretical issue, even the theory's author should feel doubts about it.\n\n3. It trusts to \"a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses\" – when, instead, philosophy should, \"like the successful sciences\", proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to \"the multitude and variety of its arguments\" as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but \"a cable whose fibers\", soever \"slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected\".\n\n4. It renders many facts \"absolutely inexplicable, unless to say that 'God makes them so' is to be regarded as an explanation\"Peirce believed in God. See section #Philosophy: metaphysics. – when, instead, philosophy should avoid being \"unidealistic\",However, Peirce disagreed with Hegelian absolute idealism. See for example Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 8.131. misbelieving that something real can defy or evade all possible ideas, and supposing, inevitably, \"some absolutely inexplicable, unanalyzable ultimate\", which explanatory surmise explains nothing and so is inadmissible.\n\nPhilosophy: metaphysics\nSome noted articles\n The Monist Metaphysical Series (1891–1893)\n The Architecture of Theories (1891)\n The Doctrine of Necessity Examined (1892)\n The Law of Mind (1892)\n Man's Glassy Essence (1892)\n Evolutionary Love (1893)\n Immortality in the Light of Synechism (1893 MS)\nPeirce divided metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) psychical or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics.\n\nOntology. Peirce was a Scholastic Realist, declaring for the reality of generals as early as 1868.Peirce (1868), \"Nominalism versus Realism\", Journal of Speculative Philosophy v. 2, n. 1, pp. 57–61. Reprinted (CP 6.619–24), (Writings of Charles S. Peirce, 2:144–53). Regarding modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.), he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are. In his 1897 \"The Logic of Relatives\" he wrote:  Peirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they would behave under certain circumstances.On developments in Peirce's realism, see:\n Peirce (1897), \"The Logic of Relatives\", The Monist v. VII, n. 2 pp. 161–217, see 206 (via Google). Reprinted Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 3.456–552.\n Peirce (1905), \"Issues of Pragmaticism\", The Monist v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481–99, see 495–496 (via Google).

Peirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits—and it is a belief in God not as an actual or existent being (in Peirce's sense of those words), but all the same as a real being.Peirce in his 1906 \"Answers to Questions concerning my Belief in God\", Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 6.495, Eprint , reprinted in part as \"The Concept of God\" in Philosophical Writings of Peirce, J. Buchler, ed., 1940, pp. 375–78:  In \"A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God\" (1908), Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will \"stand or fall with the hypothesis\"; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an \"infinitely incomprehensible\" being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be more false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is freeSee his \"The Doctrine of Necessity Examined\" (1892) and \"Reply to the Necessitarians\" (1893), to both of which editor Paul Carus responded. and (see Synechism) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality.\n\nPhysical metaphysics. Peirce held the view, which he called objective idealism, that \"matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws\".Peirce (1891), \"The Architecture of Theories\", The Monist v. 1, pp. 161–76, see p. 170, via Internet Archive. Reprinted (CP 6.7–34) and (The Essential Peirce, 1:285–97, see p. 293). Peirce asserted the reality of (1) absolute chance (his tychist view), (2) mechanical necessity (anancist view), and (3) that which he called the law of love (agapist view), echoing his categories Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called \"sporting\"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called \"tychasm\", \"anancasm\", and \"agapasm\")See \"tychism\", \"tychasm\", \"tychasticism\", and the rest, at Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce. of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in Lamarckian evolution; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity,Peirce (1893), \"Evolutionary Love\", The Monist v. 3, pp. 176–200. Reprinted Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 6.278–317, The Essential Peirce, 1:352–72. Arisbe Eprint  especially of space, time, and law.See p. 115 in Reasoning and the Logic of Things (Peirce's 1898 lectures).\n\nScience of review\n\nPeirce outlined two fields, \"Cenoscopy\" and \"Science of Review\", both of which he called philosophy. Both included philosophy about science.  In 1903 he arranged them, from more to less theoretically basic, thus:\n\n Science of Discovery.\n Mathematics.\n Cenoscopy (philosophy as discussed earlier in this article – categorial, normative, metaphysical), as First Philosophy, concerns positive phenomena in general, does not rely on findings from special sciences, and includes the general study of inquiry and scientific method.\n Idioscopy, or the Special Sciences (of nature and mind).\n Science of Review, as Ultimate Philosophy, arranges \"...the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science\". His examples included Humboldt's Cosmos, Comte's Philosophie positive, and Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy.\n Practical Science, or the Arts.\n\nPeirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time.\n\nSee also\n\n Charles Sanders Peirce's type–token distinction\n Continuous predicate\n Entitative graph\n Hypostatic abstraction\n Idea#Charles Sanders Peirce\n Laws of Form\n List of American philosophers\n Logic of information\n Logical machine\n Logical matrix\n Mathematical psychology\n Normal distribution#Naming\n Peirce triangle\n Peirce's law\n Peircean realism\n Phaneron\n Pragmatics\n Problem of universals#Peirce\n Quantification (science)#History\n Relation algebra\n Truth table\n\nContemporaries associated with Peirce\n\n Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\n Howland will forgery trial\n Allan Marquand\n George Herbert Mead\n Ventura de los Reyes Prósper\n Thorstein Veblen\n\n References \n\nExternal links\n\n Arisbe: The Peirce Gateway, Joseph Ransdell, ed.

      "title": "Clean (programming language)",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_%28programming_language%29",
      "text": "Clean is a general-purpose purely functional computer programming language. For much of the language's active development history it was called Concurrent Clean, but this was dropped at some point. Clean was developed by a group of researchers from the Radboud University in Nijmegen, 1987.\n\nFeatures\nThe language Clean first appeared in 1987 and is still being further developed. It shares many properties with Haskell:\nreferential transparency, list comprehension, guards, garbage collection, higher order functions, currying and lazy evaluation.\n\nOn Windows, an integrated development environment (IDE) is included in the Clean distribution.\n\nClean's method for dealing with mutable state and I/O is done through a uniqueness typing system, in contrast to Haskell's use of monads. The compiler takes advantage of the uniqueness type system to generate more efficient code, because it knows that anything with a uniqueness type can only be used once. Therefore, a unique value can be changed in place.ftp://ftp.cs.ru.nl/pub/Clean/papers/2007/achp2007-CleanHaskellQuickGuide.pdf\n\nExamples\nHello world:\n module hello\n Start :: {#Char}\n Start = \"Hello, world!\"\nFactorial:\n  module factorial\n  import StdEnv\n  fac 0 = 1\n  fac n = n * fac (n-1)\n\n  // find the factorial of 10\n  Start = fac 10  module factorial2\n  import StdEnv\n  fac 0 = 1\n  fac n = prod [1..n] // The product of the numbers 1 to n\n\n  // find the factorial of 6\n  Start = fac 6\nFibonacci sequence:\n  module fibonacci\n  fib 0 = 0\n  fib 1 = 1\n  fib n = fib (n - 2) + fib (n - 1) \n  Start = fib 7\nInfix operator:\n  (^) infixr 8 :: Int Int -> Int\n  (^) x 0 = 1\n  (^) x n = x * x ^ (n-1)\nThe type declaration states that the function is a right associative infix operator with priority 8: this states that x*x^(n-1) is equivalent to x*(x^(n-1)) as opposed to (x*x)^(n-1). This operator is  pre-defined in StdEnv, the Clean standard library.\n\nHow Clean works\nComputation is based on graph rewriting and reduction. Constants such as numbers are graphs and functions are graph rewriting formulas. This, combined with compilation to native code, makes Clean programs which use high abstraction run relatively fast according to the Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\n\nCompiling\n Source files (.icl) and definition files (.dcl) are translated into Core Clean, a basic variant of Clean, in Clean.\n Core clean is converted into Clean's platform-independent bytecode (.abc), implemented in C and Clean.\n Bytecode is converted to object code (.o) using C.\n Object code is linked with other files in the module and the runtime system and converted into a normal executable in Clean.\n\nEarlier Clean system versions were written completely in C, thus avoiding bootstrapping issues.\n\nThe SAPL system compiles Core Clean to JavaScript and does not use ABC code.\n\n The ABC-Machine \nTo close the gap between Core Clean, a high-level functional language, and machine code, the ABC-machine is used.\nThis is an imperative abstract graph rewriting machine.\nGenerating concrete machine code from abstract ABC code is a relatively small step, so by using the ABC-machine it is much easier to target multiple architectures for code generation.\n\nThe ABC-machine has an uncommon memory model. It has a graph store to hold the Clean graph that is being rewritten. The A(rgument)-stack holds arguments that refer to nodes in the graph store. This way, a node's arguments can be rewritten, which is needed for pattern matching. The B(asic value)-stack holds basic values (integers, characters, reals, etc.). While not strictly necessary (all these elements could be nodes in the graph store as well), using a separate stack is much more efficient. The C(ontrol)-stack holds return addresses for flow control.\n\nThe runtime system, which is linked into every executable, has a print rule which prints a node to the output channel. When a program is executed, the Start node is printed. For this, it has to be rewritten to root normal form, after which its children are rewritten to root normal form, etc., until the whole node is printed.\n\nPlatforms\nClean is available for Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, Solaris and Linux.\n\nSome libraries are not available on all platforms, like ObjectIO which is only available on Windows and Mac. The feature to write dynamics to files is only available on Windows.\n\nLicense\nClean is dual licensed: it is available under the terms of the GNU LGPL, and also under a proprietary license. For the libraries, runtime system and examples, not the GNU LGPL but the Simplified BSD License applies.\n\nVersus Haskell\n\nSpeed\nA benchmark from 2008 shows that Clean is faster than Haskell in most cases:\n\n+ Speed comparison of five compilers (time in seconds) Language  Pri  Sym  Inter  Fib  Match  Ham  Twi  Qns  Kns  Parse  Plog  Qsort  Isort  Msort SAPL Int  6.1  17.6  7.8  7.3  8.5  15.7  7.9  6.5  47.1  4.4  4.0  16.4  9.4  4.4 SAPL Bas  4.3  13.2  6.0  6.5  5.9  9.8   5.6  5.1  38.3  3.8  2.6  10.1  6.7  2.6 GHC       2.0  1.7   8.2  4.0  4.1  8.4   6.6  3.7  17.7  2.8  0.7  4.4   2.3  3.2 GHC -O    0.9  1.5   1.8  0.2  1.0  4.0   0.1  0.4  5.7   1.9  0.4  3.2   1.9  1.0 Clean     0.9  0.8   0.8  0.2  1.4  2.4   2.4  0.4  3.0   4.5  0.4  1.6   1.0  0.6\n\nAs can be seen, Clean outruns Haskell (GHC) on almost all test cases. Only parser combinators are faster in Haskell. Using GHC -O we get some optimisations, making pattern matching and higher order functions faster than in Clean as well. In most cases, however, Clean outperforms GHC -O or at least isn't slower.\n\nThe programs used were:\n\n Pri: Prime sieve; primes !! 5000\n Sym: Prime sieve using Peano numbers; sprimes !! p280\n Inter: A small SAPL interpreter, calculating the 100th prime number using a sieve\n Fib: Fibonacci; the naive Fibonacci function, calculating fib 35\n Match: Nested pattern matching (5 levels deep), repeated 2000000 times\n Ham: Hamming; the generation of the list of Hamming numbers and taking the 1000th number, 10000 times\n Twi: Twice; a higher order function (twice twice twice twice (add 1) 0), repeated 400 times\n Qns: The Queens problem; number of placements of 11 queens on an 11 × 11 chess board\n Kns: Knights; finding all knight tours on a 5 × 5 chess board\n Parse: Parser combinators; a parser for Prolog parsing a 17000 lines Prolog program\n Plog: Prolog; a small Prolog interpreter based on unification only (no arithmetic operations), calculating all descendants in a six generations family tree\n Sort: Quicksort (20000 elements), Merge sort (200000 elements) and Insertion sort (10000 elements)\n\nSyntactic differences\nThe syntax of Clean is very similar to Haskell, with some notable differences:\n\n Haskell Clean Remarks [ x | x <- [1..10] , isOdd x] [ x \\\\ x <- [1..10] | isOdd x] list comprehension x:xs [x:xs] cons operator data Tree a\n  = Empty\n  | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a) :: Tree a\n  = Empty\n  | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a) algebraic data type (Eq a, Eq b) => ... ... | Eq a & Eq b class assertions and contexts fun t@(Node l x r) = ... fun t=:(Node l x r) = ... as-patterns if x > 10 then 10 else x if (x > 10) 10 x if\n\nIn general, Haskell has introduced more syntactic sugar than Clean.\n\nCommunity\n IRC channel: #cleanlang on freenode\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nClean Wiki\nCloogle: Clean function search engine\n\nCategory:Functional languages\nCategory:Term-rewriting programming languages\nCategory:Free compilers and interpreters\nCategory:Cross-platform free software"

      "title": "Compact space",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space",
      "text": "thumb|upright=1.6|The interval  is not compact because it is not bounded. The interval  is not compact because it is not closed. The interval  is compact because it is both closed and bounded.\nIn mathematics, and more specifically in general topology, compactness is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of Euclidean space being closed (that is, containing all its limit points) and bounded (that is, having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other). Examples include a closed interval, a rectangle, or a finite set of points. This notion is defined for more general topological spaces than Euclidean space in various ways.\n\nOne such generalization is that a topological space is sequentially compact if every infinite sequence of points sampled from the space has an infinite subsequence that converges to some point of the space. The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem states that a subset of Euclidean space is compact in this sequential sense if and only if it is closed and bounded. Thus, if one chooses an infinite number of points in the closed unit interval  some of those points will get arbitrarily close to some real number in that space. For instance, some of the numbers  accumulate to 0 (others accumulate to 1). The same set of points would not accumulate to any point of the open unit interval ; so the open unit interval is not compact. Euclidean space itself is not compact since it is not bounded. In particular, the sequence of points  has no subsequence that converges to any real number.\n\nApart from closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space, typical examples of compact spaces include spaces consisting not of geometrical points but of functions. The term compact was introduced into mathematics by Maurice Fréchet in 1904 as a distillation of this concept.  Compactness in this more general situation plays an extremely important role in mathematical analysis, because many classical and important theorems of 19th-century analysis, such as the extreme value theorem, are easily generalized to this situation.  A typical application is furnished by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem or the Peano existence theorem, in which one is able to conclude the existence of a function with some required properties as a limiting case of some more elementary construction.\n\nVarious equivalent notions of compactness, including sequential compactness and limit point compactness, can be developed in general metric spaces. In general topological spaces, however, different notions of compactness are not necessarily equivalent. The most useful notion, which is the standard definition of the unqualified term compactness, is phrased in terms of the existence of finite families of open sets that \"cover\" the space in the sense that each point of the space lies in some set contained in the family. This more subtle notion, introduced by Pavel Alexandrov and Pavel Urysohn in 1929, exhibits compact spaces as generalizations of finite sets.  In spaces that are compact in this sense, it is often possible to patch together information that holds locally—that is, in a neighborhood of each point—into corresponding statements that hold throughout the space, and many theorems are of this character.\n\nThe term compact set is sometimes a synonym for compact space, but usually refers to a compact subspace of a topological space.\n\n Historical development \nIn the 19th century, several disparate mathematical properties were understood that would later be seen as consequences of compactness.  On the one hand, Bernard Bolzano (1817) had been aware that any bounded sequence of points (in the line or plane, for instance) has a subsequence that must eventually get arbitrarily close to some other point, called a limit point.  Bolzano's proof relied on the method of bisection: the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected.  The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts until it closes down on the desired limit point.  The full significance of Bolzano's theorem, and its method of proof, would not emerge until almost 50 years later when it was rediscovered by Karl Weierstrass.; \n\nIn the 1880s, it became clear that results similar to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem could be formulated for spaces of functions rather than just numbers or geometrical points. The idea of regarding functions as themselves points of a generalized space dates back to the investigations of Giulio Ascoli and Cesare Arzelà.  The culmination of their investigations, the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, was a generalization of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to families of continuous functions, the precise conclusion of which was that it was possible to extract a uniformly convergent sequence of functions from a suitable family of functions.  The uniform limit of this sequence then played precisely the same role as Bolzano's \"limit point\".  Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, results similar to that of Arzelà and Ascoli began to accumulate in the area of integral equations, as investigated by David Hilbert and Erhard Schmidt.  For a certain class of Green's functions coming from solutions of integral equations, Schmidt had shown that a property analogous to the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem held in the sense of mean convergence—or convergence in what would later be dubbed a Hilbert space.  This ultimately led to the notion of a compact operator as an offshoot of the general notion of a compact space. It was Maurice Fréchet who, in 1906, had distilled the essence of the Bolzano–Weierstrass property and coined the term compactness to refer to this general phenomenon (he used the term already in his 1904 paperFrechet, M. 1904. Generalisation d'un theorem de Weierstrass. Analyse Mathematique. which led to the famous 1906 thesis).\n\nHowever, a different notion of compactness altogether had also slowly emerged at the end of the 19th century from the study of the continuum, which was seen as fundamental for the rigorous formulation of analysis.  In 1870, Eduard Heine showed that a continuous function defined on a closed and bounded interval was in fact uniformly continuous.  In the course of the proof, he made use of a lemma that from any countable cover of the interval by smaller open intervals, it was possible to select a finite number of these that also covered it. The significance of this lemma was recognized by Émile Borel (1895), and it was generalized to arbitrary collections of intervals by Pierre Cousin (1895) and Henri Lebesgue (1904).  The Heine–Borel theorem, as the result is now known, is another special property possessed by closed and bounded sets of real numbers.\n\nThis property was significant because it allowed for the passage from local information about a set (such as the continuity of a function) to global information about the set (such as the uniform continuity of a function).  This sentiment was expressed by , who also exploited it in the development of the integral now bearing his name.  Ultimately the Russian school of point-set topology, under the direction of Pavel Alexandrov and Pavel Urysohn, formulated Heine–Borel compactness in a way that could be applied to the modern notion of a topological space.   showed that the earlier version of compactness due to Fréchet, now called (relative) sequential compactness, under appropriate conditions followed from the version of compactness that was formulated in terms of the existence of finite subcovers.  It was this notion of compactness that became the dominant one, because it was not only a stronger property, but it could be formulated in a more general setting with a minimum of additional technical machinery, as it relied only on the structure of the open sets in a space.\n\nBasic examples\nAny finite space is trivially compact. A non-trivial example of a compact space is the (closed) unit interval  of real numbers.  If one chooses an infinite number of distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some accumulation point in that interval. For instance, the odd-numbered terms of the sequence  get arbitrarily close to 0, while the even-numbered ones get arbitrarily close to 1.  The given example sequence shows the importance of including the boundary points of the interval, since the limit points must be in the space itself — an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also crucial that the interval be bounded, since in the interval  one could choose the sequence of points , of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.\n\nIn two dimensions, closed disks are compact since for any infinite number of points sampled from a disk, some subset of those points must get arbitrarily close either to a point within the disc, or to a point on the boundary.  However, an open disk is not compact, because a sequence of points can tend to the boundary without getting arbitrarily close to any point in the interior.  Likewise, spheres are compact, but a sphere missing a point is not since a sequence of points can tend to the missing point, thereby not getting arbitrarily close to any point within the space.  Lines and planes are not compact, since one can take a set of equally-spaced points in any given direction without approaching any point.\n\nDefinitions\nVarious definitions of compactness may apply, depending on the level of generality.  A subset of Euclidean space in particular is called compact if it is closed and bounded.  This implies, by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, that any infinite sequence from the set has a subsequence that converges to a point in the set.  Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as sequential compactness and limit point compactness, can be developed in general metric spaces.\n\nIn general topological spaces, however, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent, and the most useful notion of compactness—originally called bicompactness—is defined using covers consisting of open sets (see Open cover definition below). That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the Heine–Borel theorem. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known locally—in a neighbourhood of each point of the space—and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space.  An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is uniformly continuous; here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.\n\nOpen cover definition\n\nFormally, a topological space  is called compact if each of its open covers has a finite subcover. That is,  is compact if for every collection  of open subsets of  such that\n\n,\n\nthere is a finite subset  of  such that\n\nSome branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, typically influenced by the French school of Bourbaki, use the term quasi-compact for the general notion, and reserve the term compact for topological spaces that are both Hausdorff and quasi-compact.  A compact set is sometimes referred to as a compactum, plural compacta.\n\nCompactness of subsets\nA subset  of a topological space  is said to be compact if it is compact as a subspace (in the subspace topology).  That is,  is compact if for every arbitrary collection  of open subsets of  such that\n\n,\n\nthere is a finite subset  of  such that\n\n.\n\nCompactness is a \"topological\" property. That is, if , with subset  equipped with the subspace topology, then  is compact in  if and only if  is compact in .\n\nEquivalent definitions\nAssuming the axiom of choice, the following are equivalent:\n A topological space X  is compact.\n Every open cover of X has a finite subcover.\n X has a sub-base such that every cover of the space by members of the sub-base has a finite subcover (Alexander's sub-base theorem)\n Any collection of closed subsets of X with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection.\n Every net on X has a convergent subnet (see the article on nets for a proof).\n Every filter on X has a convergent refinement.\n Every net on X has a cluster point.\n Every filter on X has a cluster point.\n Every ultrafilter on X converges to at least one point.\n Every infinite subset of X has a complete accumulation point.\n\nEuclidean space\nFor any subset A of Euclidean space Rn, A is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded; this is the Heine–Borel theorem.\n\nAs a Euclidean space is a metric space, the conditions in the next subsection also apply to all of its subsets. Of all of the equivalent conditions, it is in practice easiest to verify that a subset is closed and bounded, for example, for a closed interval or closed n-ball.\n\nMetric spaces\nFor any metric space (X, d), the following are equivalent:\n (X, d) is compact.\n (X, d) is complete and totally bounded (this is also equivalent to compactness for uniform spaces).\n (X, d) is sequentially compact; that is, every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in X (this is also equivalent to compactness for first-countable uniform spaces).\n (X, d) is limit point compact; that is, every infinite subset of X has at least one limit point in X.\n (X, d) is an image of a continuous function from the Cantor set. Theorem 30.7.\n\nA compact metric space (X, d) also satisfies the following properties:\n Lebesgue's number lemma: For every open cover of X, there exists a number  such that every subset of X of diameter < δ is contained in some member of the cover.\n (X, d) is second-countable, separable and Lindelöf – these three conditions are equivalent for metric spaces. The converse is not true; e.g., a countable discrete space satisfies these three conditions, but is not compact.\n X is closed and bounded (as a subset of any metric space whose restricted metric is d). The converse may fail for a non-Euclidean space; e.g. the real line equipped with the discrete metric is closed and bounded but not compact, as the collection of all singletons of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. It is complete but not totally bounded.\n\nCharacterization by continuous functions\nLet X be a topological space and C(X) the ring of real continuous functions on X.  For each p∈X, the evaluation map \ngiven by evp(f)=f(p) is a ring homomorphism.  The kernel of evp is a maximal ideal, since the residue field  is the field of real numbers, by the first isomorphism theorem.  A topological space X is pseudocompact if and only if every maximal ideal in C(X) has residue field the real numbers.  For completely regular spaces, this is equivalent to every maximal ideal being the kernel of an evaluation homomorphism.  There are pseudocompact spaces that are not compact, though.\n\nIn general, for non-pseudocompact spaces there are always maximal ideals m in C(X) such that the residue field C(X)/m is a (non-archimedean) hyperreal field.  The framework of non-standard analysis allows for the following alternative characterization of compactness: a topological space X is compact if and only if every point x of the natural extension *X is infinitely close to a point x0 of X (more precisely, x is contained in the monad of x0).\n\nHyperreal definition\nA space X is compact if its hyperreal extension *X (constructed, for example, by the ultrapower construction) has the property that every point of *X is infinitely close to some point of X⊂*X. For example, an open real interval  is not compact because its hyperreal extension *(0,1) contains infinitesimals, which are infinitely close to 0, which is not a point of X.\n\n Properties of compact spaces \n\nFunctions and compact spaces\nA continuous image of a compact space is compact.; See also \nThis implies the extreme value theorem: a continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum. (Slightly more generally, this is true for an upper semicontinuous function.) As a sort of converse to the above statements, the pre-image of a compact space under a proper map is compact.\n\nCompact spaces and set operations\nA closed subset of a compact space is compact,; ;  and a finite union of compact sets is compact.\n\nThe product of any collection of compact spaces is compact. (This is Tychonoff's theorem, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice.)\n\nEvery topological space X is an open dense subspace of a compact space having at most one point more than X, by the Alexandroff one-point compactification.  By the same construction, every locally compact Hausdorff space X is an open dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space having at most one point more than X.\n\nOrdered compact spaces\nA nonempty compact subset of the real numbers has a greatest element and a least element.\n\nLet X be a simply ordered set endowed with the order topology. Then X is compact if and only if X is a complete lattice (i.e. all subsets have suprema and infima).\n\nExamples\n Any finite topological space, including the empty set, is compact.  More generally, any space with a finite topology (only finitely many open sets) is compact; this includes in particular the trivial topology.\n Any space carrying the cofinite topology is compact.\n Any locally compact Hausdorff space can be turned into a compact space by adding a single point to it, by means of Alexandroff one-point compactification. The one-point compactification of R is homeomorphic to the circle S1; the one-point compactification of R2 is homeomorphic to the sphere S2. Using the one-point compactification, one can also easily construct compact spaces which are not Hausdorff, by starting with a non-Hausdorff space.\n The right order topology or left order topology on any bounded totally ordered set is compact. In particular, Sierpiński space is compact.\n No discrete space with an infinite number of points is compact. The collection of all singletons of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. Finite discrete spaces are compact.\n In R carrying the lower limit topology, no uncountable set is compact.\n In the cocountable topology on an uncountable set, no infinite set is compact. Like the previous example, the space as a whole is not locally compact but is still Lindelöf.\n The closed unit interval  is compact. This follows from the Heine–Borel theorem. The open interval  is not compact: the open cover  for  does not have a finite subcover. Similarly, the set of rational numbers in the closed interval  is not compact: the sets of rational numbers in the intervals  cover all the rationals in [0, 1] for  but this cover does not have a finite subcover. Here, the sets are open in the subspace topology even though they are not open as subsets of R.\n The set R of all real numbers is not compact as there is a cover of open intervals that does not have a finite subcover. For example, intervals  , where  takes all integer values in Z, cover R but there is no finite subcover.\n On the other hand, the extended real number line carrying the analogous topology is compact; note that the cover described above would never reach the points at infinity.  In fact, the set has the homeomorphism to [-1,1] of mapping each infinity to its corresponding unit and every real number to its sign multiplied by the unique number in the positive part of interval that results in its absolute value when divided by one minus itself, and since homeomorphisms preserve covers, the Heine-Borel property can be inferred.\n For every natural number , the -sphere is compact. Again from the Heine–Borel theorem, the closed unit ball of any finite-dimensional normed vector space is compact. This is not true for infinite dimensions; in fact, a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if its closed unit ball is compact.\n On the other hand, the closed unit ball of the dual of a normed space is compact for the weak-* topology. (Alaoglu's theorem)\n The Cantor set is compact. In fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.\n Consider the set K of all functions f : R → [0,1] from the real number line to the closed unit interval, and define a topology on K so that a sequence  in K converges towards  if and only if  converges towards f(x) for all real numbers x. There is only one such topology; it is called the topology of pointwise convergence or the product topology. Then K is a compact topological space; this follows from the Tychonoff theorem.\n Consider the set K of all functions f :  →  satisfying the Lipschitz condition |f(x) − f(y)| ≤ |x − y| for all x, y ∈ .  Consider on K  the metric induced by the uniform distance  Then by Arzelà–Ascoli theorem the space K is compact.\n The spectrum of any bounded linear operator on a Banach space is a nonempty compact subset of the complex numbers C. Conversely, any compact subset of C arises in this manner, as the spectrum of some bounded linear operator. For instance, a diagonal operator on the Hilbert space  may have any compact nonempty subset of C as spectrum.\n\n Algebraic examples \n Compact groups such as an orthogonal group are compact, while groups such as a general linear group are not.\n Since the p-adic integers are homeomorphic to the Cantor set, they form a compact set.\n The spectrum of any commutative ring with the Zariski topology (that is, the set of all prime ideals) is compact, but never Hausdorff (except in trivial cases). In algebraic geometry, such topological spaces are examples of quasi-compact schemes, \"quasi\" referring to the non-Hausdorff nature of the topology.\n The spectrum of a Boolean algebra is compact, a fact which is part of the Stone representation theorem. Stone spaces, compact totally disconnected Hausdorff spaces, form the abstract framework in which these spectra are studied.  Such spaces are also useful in the study of profinite groups.\n The structure space of a commutative unital Banach algebra is a compact Hausdorff space.\n The Hilbert cube is compact, again a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem.\n A profinite group (e.g., Galois group) is compact.\n\n See also \n Compactly generated space\n Eberlein compactum\n Exhaustion by compact sets\n Lindelöf space\n Metacompact space\n Noetherian topological space\n Orthocompact space\n Paracompact space\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n.\n.\n.\n (Purely analytic proof of the theorem that between any two values which give results of opposite sign, there lies at least one real root of the equation).\n\n.\n .\n .\n .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n \n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nCategory:Compactness (mathematics)\nCategory:General topology\nCategory:Properties of topological spaces\nCategory:Topology"

      "text": "Computability theory, also known as recursion theory, is a branch of mathematical logic, of computer science, and of the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, recursion theory overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory.\n\nBasic questions addressed by recursion theory include:\n What does it mean for a function on the natural numbers to be computable?\n How can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?\n\nAlthough there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematical recursion theorists study the theory of relative computability, reducibility notions, and degree structures; those in the computer science field focus on the theory of subrecursive hierarchies, formal methods, and formal languages.\n\nComputable and uncomputable sets\nRecursion theory originated in the 1930s, with work of Kurt Gödel, Alonzo Church, Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Stephen Kleene, and Emil Post.Many of these foundational papers are collected in The Undecidable (1965) edited by Martin Davis..\n\nThe fundamental results the researchers obtained established Turing computability as the correct formalization of the informal idea of effective calculation. These results led Stephen Kleene (1952) to coin the two names \"Church's thesis\" (Kleene 1952:300) and \"Turing's Thesis\" (Kleene 1952:376). Nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis, the Church–Turing thesis, which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function. Although initially skeptical, by 1946 Gödel argued in favor of this thesis: \n\n\"Tarski has stressed in his lecture (and I think justly) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness (or Turing's computability). It seems to me that this importance is largely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion, i.e., one not depending on the formalism chosen.*\"(Gödel 1946 in Davis 1965:84).The full paper can also be found at pages 150ff (with commentary by Charles Parsons at 144ff) in Feferman et al. editors 1990 Kurt Gödel Volume II Publications 1938-1974, Oxford University Press, New York, . Both reprintings have the following footnote * added to the Davis volume by Gödel in 1965: \"To be more precise: a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic, where a function f is called computable in S if there is in S a computable term representing f (p. 150).\n\nWith a definition of effective calculation came the first proofs that there are problems in mathematics that cannot be effectively decided. Church (1936a, 1936b) and Turing (1936), inspired by techniques used by Gödel (1931) to prove his incompleteness theorems, independently demonstrated that the Entscheidungsproblem is not effectively decidable. This result showed that there is no algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true or false.\n\nMany problems in mathematics have been shown to be undecidable after these initial examples were established.  In 1947, Markov and Post published independent papers showing that the word problem for semigroups cannot be effectively decided. Extending this result, Pyotr Novikov and William Boone showed independently in the 1950s that the word problem for groups is not effectively solvable: there is no effective procedure that, given a word in a finitely presented group, will decide whether the element represented by the word is the identity element of the group. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved (using results of Julia Robinson) Matiyasevich's theorem, which implies that Hilbert's tenth problem has no effective solution; this problem asked whether there is an effective procedure to decide whether a Diophantine equation over the integers has a solution in the integers. The list of undecidable problems gives additional examples of problems with no computable solution.\n\nThe study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics; the Handbook of Recursive Mathematics (Ershov et al. 1998) covers many of the known results in this field.\n\nTuring computability\nThe main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by Turing (1936).  A set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set (also called a decidable,  recursive, or Turing computable set) if there is a Turing machine that, given a number n, halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set.   A function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or (Turing) computable function if there is a Turing machine that, on input n, halts and returns output f(n). The use of Turing machines here is not necessary; there are many other models of computation that have the same computing power as Turing machines; for example the μ-recursive functions obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator.\n\nThe terminology for recursive functions and sets is not completely standardized. \nThe definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by Gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a Turing machine. The word decidable stems from the German word Entscheidungsproblem which was used in the original papers of Turing and others. In contemporary use, the term \"computable function\" has various definitions: according to Cutland (1980), it is a partial recursive function (which can be undefined for some inputs), while according to Soare (1987) it is a total recursive (equivalently, general recursive) function. This article follows the second of these conventions.  Soare (1996) gives additional comments about the terminology.\n\nNot every set of natural numbers is computable. The halting problem, which is the set of (descriptions of) Turing machines that halt on input 0, is a well-known example of a noncomputable set.  The existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countably many Turing machines, and thus only countably many computable sets, but according to the Cantor's theorem, there are uncountably many sets of natural numbers.\n\nAlthough the halting problem is not computable, it is possible to simulate program execution and produce an infinite list of the programs that do halt. Thus the halting problem is an example of a recursively enumerable set, which is a set that can be enumerated by a Turing machine (other terms for recursively enumerable include computably enumerable and semidecidable). Equivalently, a set is recursively enumerable if and only if it is the range of some computable function.  The recursively enumerable sets, although not decidable in general, have been studied in detail in recursion theory.\n\nAreas of research\nBeginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above, the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics. These are not independent areas of research: each of these areas draws ideas and results from the others, and most recursion theorists are familiar with the majority of them.\n\nRelative computability and the Turing degrees\n\nRecursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability, a generalization of Turing computability defined using oracle Turing machines, introduced by Turing (1939).  An oracle Turing machine is a hypothetical device which, in addition to performing the actions of a regular Turing machine, is able to ask questions of an oracle, which is a particular set of natural numbers.  The oracle machine may only ask questions of the form \"Is n in the oracle set?\". Each question will be immediately answered correctly, even if the oracle set is not computable. Thus an oracle machine with a noncomputable oracle will be able to compute sets that a Turing machine without an oracle cannot.\n\nInformally, a set of natural numbers A is Turing reducible to a set B if there is an oracle machine that correctly tells whether numbers are in A when run with B as the oracle set (in this case, the set A is also said to be (relatively) computable from B and recursive in B).  If a set A is Turing reducible to a set B and B is Turing reducible to A then the sets are said to have the same Turing degree (also called degree of unsolvability).  The Turing degree of a set gives a precise measure of how uncomputable the set is.\n\nThe natural examples of sets that are not computable, including many different sets that encode variants of the halting problem, have two properties in common:\nThey are recursively enumerable, and\nEach can be translated into any other via a many-one reduction. That is, given such sets A and B, there is a total computable function f such that A = {x : f(x) ∈ B}. These sets are said to be many-one equivalent (or m-equivalent).\n\nMany-one reductions are \"stronger\" than Turing reductions: if a set A is many-one reducible to a set B, then A is Turing reducible to B, but the converse does not always hold. Although the natural examples of noncomputable sets are all many-one equivalent, it is possible to construct recursively enumerable sets A and B such that A is Turing reducible to B but not many-one reducible to B. It can be shown that every recursively enumerable set is many-one reducible to the halting problem, and thus the halting problem is the most complicated recursively enumerable set with respect to many-one reducibility and with respect to Turing reducibility. Post (1944) asked whether every recursively enumerable set is either computable or Turing equivalent to the halting problem, that is, whether there is no recursively enumerable set with a Turing degree intermediate between those two.\n\nAs intermediate results, Post defined natural types of recursively enumerable sets like the simple, hypersimple and hyperhypersimple sets. Post showed that these sets are strictly between the computable sets and the halting problem with respect to many-one reducibility. Post also showed that some of them are strictly intermediate under other reducibility notions stronger than Turing reducibility.  But Post left open the main problem of the existence of recursively enumerable sets of intermediate Turing degree; this problem became known as Post's problem. After ten years, Kleene and Post showed in 1954 that there are intermediate Turing degrees between those of the computable sets and the halting problem, but they failed to show that any of these degrees contains a recursively enumerable set. Very soon after this, Friedberg and Muchnik independently solved Post's problem by establishing the existence of recursively enumerable sets of intermediate degree. This groundbreaking result opened a wide study of the Turing degrees of the recursively enumerable sets which turned out to possess a very complicated and non-trivial structure.\n\nThere are uncountably many sets that are not recursively enumerable, and the investigation of the Turing degrees of all sets is as central in recursion theory as the investigation of the recursively enumerable Turing degrees. Many degrees with special properties were constructed: hyperimmune-free degrees where every function computable relative to that degree is majorized by a (unrelativized) computable function; high degrees relative to which one can compute a function f which dominates every computable function g in the sense that there is a constant c depending on g such that g(x) < f(x) for all x > c; random degrees containing algorithmically random sets; 1-generic degrees of 1-generic sets; and the degrees below the halting problem of limit-recursive sets.\n\nThe study of arbitrary (not necessarily recursively enumerable) Turing degrees involves the study of the Turing jump.  Given a set A, the Turing jump of A is a set of natural numbers encoding a solution to the halting problem for oracle Turing machines running with oracle A.  The Turing jump of any set is always of higher Turing degree than the original set, and a theorem of Friedburg shows that any set that computes the Halting problem can be obtained as the Turing jump of another set. Post's theorem establishes a close relationship between the Turing jump operation and the arithmetical hierarchy, which is a classification of certain subsets of the natural numbers based on their definability in arithmetic.\n\nMuch recent research on Turing degrees has focused on the overall structure of the set of Turing degrees and the set of Turing degrees containing recursively enumerable sets.  A deep theorem of Shore and Slaman (1999) states that the function mapping a degree x to the degree of its Turing jump is definable in the partial order of the Turing degrees.  A recent survey by Ambos-Spies and Fejer (2006) gives an overview of this research and its historical progression.\n\nOther reducibilities\n\nAn ongoing area of research in recursion theory studies reducibility relations other than Turing reducibility. Post (1944) introduced several strong reducibilities, so named because they imply truth-table reducibility. A Turing machine implementing a strong reducibility will compute a total function regardless of which oracle it is presented with.  Weak reducibilities are those where a reduction process may not terminate for all oracles; Turing reducibility is one example.\n\nThe strong reducibilities include:\nOne-one reducibility A is one-one reducible (or 1-reducible) to B if there is a total computable injective function f such that each n is in A if and only if f(n) is in B.\nMany-one reducibility This is essentially one-one reducibility without the constraint that f be injective.  A is many-one reducible (or m-reducible) to B if there is a total computable function f such that each n is in A if and only if f(n) is in B.\nTruth-table reducibility A is truth-table reducible to B if A is Turing reducible to B via an oracle Turing machine that computes a total function regardless of the oracle it is given.  Because of compactness of Cantor space, this is equivalent to saying that the reduction presents a single list of questions (depending only on the input) to the oracle simultaneously, and then having seen their answers is able to produce an output without asking additional questions regardless of the oracle's answer to the initial queries. Many variants of truth-table reducibility have also been studied.\nFurther reducibilities (positive, disjunctive, conjunctive, linear and their weak and bounded versions) are discussed in the article Reduction (recursion theory).\n\nThe major research on strong reducibilities has been to compare their theories, both for the class of all recursively enumerable sets as well as for the class of all subsets of the natural numbers. Furthermore, the relations between the reducibilities has been studied. For example, it is known that every Turing degree is either a truth-table degree or is the union of infinitely many truth-table degrees.\n\nReducibilities weaker than Turing reducibility (that is, reducibilities that are implied by Turing reducibility) have also been studied.  The most well known are arithmetical reducibility and hyperarithmetical reducibility. These reducibilities are closely connected to definability over the standard model of arithmetic.\n\nRice's theorem and the arithmetical hierarchy\nRice showed that for every nontrivial class C (which contains some but not all r.e. sets) the index set E = {e: the eth r.e. set We is in C} has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to E, that is, can be mapped using a many-one reduction to E (see Rice's theorem for more detail). But, many of these index sets are even more complicated than the halting problem. These type of sets can be classified using the arithmetical hierarchy. For example, the index set FIN of class of all finite sets is on the level Σ2, the index set REC of the class of all recursive sets is on the level Σ3, the index set COFIN of all cofinite sets is also on the level Σ3 and the index set COMP of the class of all Turing-complete sets Σ4. These hierarchy levels are defined inductively, Σn+1 contains just all sets which are recursively enumerable relative to Σn; Σ1 contains the recursively enumerable sets. The index sets given here are even complete for their levels, that is, all the sets in these levels can be many-one reduced to the given index sets.\n\nReverse mathematics\n\nThe program of reverse mathematics asks which set-existence axioms are necessary to prove particular theorems of mathematics in subsystems of second-order arithmetic.  This study was initiated by Harvey Friedman and was studied in detail by Stephen Simpson and others; Simpson (1999) gives a detailed discussion of the program. The set-existence axioms in question correspond informally to axioms saying that the powerset of the natural numbers is closed under various reducibility notions. The weakest such axiom studied in reverse mathematics is recursive comprehension, which states that the powerset of the naturals is closed under Turing reducibility.\n\nNumberings\nA numbering is an enumeration of functions; it has two parameters, e and x and outputs the value of the e-th function in the numbering on the input x. Numberings can be partial-recursive although some of its members are total recursive, that is, computable functions. Admissible numberings are those into which all others can be translated. A Friedberg numbering (named after its discoverer) is a one-one numbering of all partial-recursive functions; it is necessarily not an admissible numbering. Later research dealt also with numberings of other classes like classes of recursively enumerable sets. Goncharov discovered for example a class of recursively enumerable sets for which the numberings fall into exactly two classes with respect to recursive isomorphisms.\n\nThe priority method\nFor further explanation, see the section Post's problem and the priority method in the article Turing degree.\n\nPost's problem was solved with a method called the priority method; a proof using this method is called a priority argument.  This method is primarily used to construct recursively enumerable sets with particular properties. To use this method, the desired properties of the set to be constructed are broken up into an infinite list of goals, known as requirements, so that satisfying all the requirements will cause the set constructed to have the desired properties.   Each requirement is assigned to a natural number representing the priority of the requirement; so 0 is assigned to the most important priority, 1 to the second most important, and so on.  The set is then constructed in stages, each stage attempting to satisfy one of more of the requirements by either adding numbers to the set or banning numbers from the set so that the final set will satisfy the requirement. It may happen that satisfying one requirement will cause another to become unsatisfied; the priority order is used to decide what to do in such an event.\n\nPriority arguments have been employed to solve many problems in recursion theory, and have been classified into a hierarchy based on their complexity (Soare 1987). Because complex priority arguments can be technical and difficult to follow, it has \ntraditionally been considered desirable to prove results without priority arguments, or to see if results proved with priority arguments can also be proved without them. \nFor example, Kummer published a paper on a proof for the existence of Friedberg numberings without using the priority method.\n\nThe lattice of recursively enumerable sets\nWhen Post defined the notion of a simple set as an r.e. set with an infinite complement not containing any infinite r.e. set, he started to study the structure of the recursively enumerable sets under inclusion. This lattice became a well-studied structure. Recursive sets can be defined in this structure by the basic result that a set is recursive if and only if the set and its complement are both recursively enumerable. Infinite r.e. sets have always infinite recursive subsets; but on the other hand, simple sets exist but do not have a coinfinite recursive superset. Post (1944) introduced already hypersimple and hyperhypersimple sets; later maximal sets were constructed which are r.e. sets such that every r.e. superset is either a finite variant of the given maximal set or is co-finite. Post's original motivation in the study of this lattice was to find a structural notion such that every set which satisfies this property is neither in the Turing degree of the recursive sets nor in the Turing degree of the halting problem. Post did not find such a property and the solution to his problem applied priority methods instead; Harrington and Soare (1991) found eventually such a property.\n\nAutomorphism problems\nAnother important question is the existence of automorphisms in recursion-theoretic structures. One of these structures is that one of recursively enumerable sets under inclusion modulo finite difference; in this structure, A is below B if and only if the set difference B − A is finite. Maximal sets (as defined in the previous paragraph) have the property that they cannot be automorphic to non-maximal sets, that is, if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned, then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set. Soare (1974) showed that also the converse holds, that is, every two maximal sets are automorphic. So the maximal sets form an orbit, that is, every automorphism preserves maximality and any two maximal sets are transformed into each other by some automorphism. Harrington gave a further example of an automorphic property: that of the creative sets, the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem.\n\nBesides the lattice of recursively enumerable sets, automorphisms are also studied for the structure of the Turing degrees of all sets as well as for the structure of the Turing degrees of r.e. sets. In both cases, Cooper claims to have constructed nontrivial automorphisms which map some degrees to other degrees; this construction has, however, not been verified and some colleagues believe that the construction contains errors and that the question of whether there is a nontrivial automorphism of the Turing degrees is still one of the main unsolved questions in this area (Slaman and Woodin 1986, Ambos-Spies and Fejer 2006).\n\nKolmogorov complexity\n\nThe field of Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic randomness was developed during the 1960s and 1970s by Chaitin, Kolmogorov, Levin, Martin-Löf and Solomonoff (the names are given here in alphabetical order; much of the research was independent, and the unity of the concept of randomness was not understood at the time). The main idea is to consider a universal Turing machine U and to measure the complexity of a number (or string) x as the length of the shortest input p such that U(p) outputs x. This approach revolutionized earlier ways to determine when an infinite sequence (equivalently, characteristic function of a subset of the natural numbers) is random or not by invoking a notion of randomness for finite objects. Kolmogorov complexity became not only a subject of independent study but is also applied to other subjects as a tool for obtaining proofs.\nThere are still many open problems in this area. For that reason, a recent research conference in this area was held in January 2007Conference on Logic, Computability and Randomness, January 10–13, 2007. and a list of open problemsThe homepage of Andre Nies has a list of open problems in Kolmogorov complexity is maintained by Joseph Miller and Andre Nies.\n\nFrequency computation\nThis branch of recursion theory analyzed the following question: For fixed m and n with 0 < m < n, for which functions A is it possible to compute for any different n inputs x1, x2, ..., xn a tuple of n numbers y1,y2,...,yn such that at least m of the equations A(xk) = yk are true. Such sets are known as (m, n)-recursive sets. The first major result in this branch of Recursion Theory is Trakhtenbrot's result that a set is computable if it is (m, n)-recursive for some m, n with 2m > n. On the other hand, Jockusch's semirecursive sets (which were already known informally before Jockusch introduced them 1968) are examples of a set which is (m, n)-recursive if and only if 2m < n + 1. There are uncountably many of these sets and also some recursively enumerable but noncomputable sets of this type. Later, Degtev established a hierarchy of recursively enumerable sets that are (1, n + 1)-recursive but not (1, n)-recursive. After a long phase of research by Russian scientists, this subject became repopularized in the west by Beigel's thesis on bounded queries, which linked frequency computation to the above-mentioned bounded reducibilities and other related notions. One of the major results was Kummer's Cardinality Theory which states that a set A is computable if and only if there is an n such that some algorithm enumerates for each tuple of n different numbers up to n many possible choices of the cardinality of this set of n numbers intersected with A; these choices must contain the true cardinality but leave out at least one false one.\n\nInductive inference\nThis is the recursion-theoretic branch of learning theory. It is based on Gold's model of learning in the limit from 1967 and has developed since then more and more models of learning. The general scenario is the following: Given a class S of computable functions, is there a learner (that is, recursive functional) which outputs for any input of the form (f(0),f(1),...,f(n)) a hypothesis. A learner M learns a function f if almost all hypotheses are the same index e of f with respect to a previously agreed on acceptable numbering of all computable functions; M learns S if M learns every f in S. Basic results are that all recursively enumerable classes of functions are learnable while the class REC of all computable functions is not learnable. Many related models have been considered and also the learning of classes of recursively enumerable sets from positive data is a topic studied from Gold's pioneering paper in 1967 onwards.\n\nGeneralizations of Turing computability\nRecursion theory includes the study of generalized notions of this field such as arithmetic reducibility, hyperarithmetical reducibility and α-recursion theory, as described by Sacks (1990).  These generalized notions include reducibilities that cannot be executed by Turing machines but are nevertheless natural generalizations of Turing reducibility. These studies include approaches to investigate the analytical hierarchy which differs from the arithmetical hierarchy by permitting quantification over sets of natural numbers in addition to quantification over individual numbers. These areas are linked to the theories of well-orderings and trees; for example the set of all indices of recursive (nonbinary) trees without infinite branches is complete for level  of the analytical hierarchy. Both Turing reducibility and hyperarithmetical reducibility are important in the field of effective descriptive set theory.  The even more general notion of degrees of constructibility is studied in set theory.\n\nContinuous computability theory\nComputability theory for digital computation is well developed. Computability theory is less well developed for analog computation that occurs in analog computers, analog signal processing, analog electronics, neural networks and continuous-time control theory, modelled by differential equations and continuous dynamical systems (Orponen 1997; Moore 1996).\n\nRelationships between definability, proof and computability\nThere are close relationships between the Turing degree of a set of natural numbers and the difficulty (in terms of the arithmetical hierarchy) of defining that set using a first-order formula. One such relationship is made precise by Post's theorem. A weaker relationship was demonstrated by Kurt Gödel in the proofs of his completeness theorem and incompleteness theorems. Gödel's proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a recursively enumerable set, and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable.  Similarly, Tarski's indefinability theorem can be interpreted both in terms of definability and in terms of computability.\n\nRecursion theory is also linked to second order arithmetic, a formal theory of natural numbers and sets of natural numbers.  The fact that certain sets are computable or relatively computable often implies that these sets can be defined in weak subsystems of second order arithmetic.  The program of reverse mathematics uses these subsystems to measure the noncomputability inherent in well known mathematical theorems. Simpson (1999) discusses many aspects of second-order arithmetic and reverse mathematics.\n\nThe field of proof theory includes the study of second-order arithmetic and Peano arithmetic, as well as formal theories of the natural numbers weaker than Peano arithmetic.  One method of classifying the strength of these weak systems is by characterizing which computable functions the system can prove to be total (see Fairtlough and Wainer (1998)).  For example, in primitive recursive arithmetic any computable function that is provably total is actually primitive recursive, while Peano arithmetic proves that functions like the Ackermann function, which are not primitive recursive, are total. Not every total computable function is provably total in Peano arithmetic, however; an example of such a function is provided by Goodstein's theorem.\n\nName\nThe field of mathematical logic dealing with computability and its generalizations has been called \"recursion theory\" since its early days. Robert I. Soare, a prominent researcher in the field, has proposed (Soare 1996) that the field should be called \"computability theory\" instead. He argues that Turing's terminology using the word \"computable\" is more natural and more widely understood than the terminology using the word \"recursive\" introduced by Kleene. Many contemporary researchers have begun to use this alternate terminology.Mathscinet searches for the titles like \"computably enumerable\" and \"c.e.\" show that many papers have been published with this terminology as well as with the other one. These researchers also use terminology such as partial computable function and computably enumerable (c.e.) set instead of partial recursive function and recursively enumerable (r.e.) set. Not all researchers have been convinced, however, as explained by FortnowLance Fortnow, \"Is it Recursive, Computable or Decidable?,\"  2004-2-15, accessed 2018-3-22. and Simpson.Stephen G. Simpson, \"What is computability theory?,\" FOM email list, 1998-8-24, accessed 2006-1-9.\nSome commentators argue that both the names recursion theory and computability theory fail to convey the fact that most of the objects studied in recursion theory are not computable.Harvey Friedman, \"Renaming recursion theory,\" FOM email list, 1998-8-28, accessed 2006-1-9.\n\nRogers (1967) has suggested that a key property of recursion theory is that its results and structures should be invariant under computable bijections on the natural numbers (this suggestion draws on the ideas of the Erlangen program in geometry). The idea is that a computable bijection merely renames numbers in a set, rather than indicating any structure in the set, much as a rotation of the Euclidean plane does not change any geometric aspect of lines drawn on it. Since any two infinite computable sets are linked by a computable bijection, this proposal identifies all the infinite computable sets (the finite computable sets are viewed as trivial). According to Rogers, the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets, partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers.\n\n Professional organizations \nThe main professional organization for recursion theory is the Association for Symbolic Logic, which holds several research conferences each year. The interdisciplinary research Association  Computability in Europe (CiE) also organizes a series of annual conferences.\n\n See also \n\n Recursion (computer science)\n Computability logic\n Transcomputational problem\n\n Notes \n\n References \n Undergraduate level texts\n\n Advanced texts\n\n Survey papers and collections\n Unpublished preprint.\n\n Research papers and collections\n\n Reprinted in .\n  Reprinted in .\n\n  \n\n \n\n Reprinted in .\n\n  Reprinted in .

      "text": "Computable functions are the basic objects of study in computability theory. Computable functions are the formalized analogue of the intuitive notion of algorithm, in the sense that a function is computable if there exists an algorithm that can do the job of the function, i.e. given an input of the function domain it can return the corresponding output. Computable functions are used to discuss computability without referring to any concrete model of computation such as Turing machines or register machines. Any definition, however, must make reference to some specific model of computation but all valid definitions yield the same class of functions.\nParticular models of computability that give rise to the set of computable functions are the Turing-computable functions and the μ-recursive functions.\n\nBefore the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable.   This term has since come to be identified with the computable functions. Note that the effective computability of these functions does not imply that they can be efficiently computed (i.e. computed within a reasonable amount of time). In fact, for some effectively calculable functions it can be shown that any algorithm that computes them will be very inefficient in the sense that the running time of the algorithm increases exponentially (or even superexponentially) with the length of the input. The fields of feasible computability and computational complexity study functions that can be computed efficiently.\n\nAccording to the Church–Turing thesis, computable functions are exactly the functions that can be calculated using a mechanical calculation device given unlimited amounts of time and storage space. Equivalently, this thesis states that a function is computable if and only if it has an algorithm.  Note that an algorithm in this sense is understood to be a sequence of steps a person with unlimited time and an unlimited supply of pen and paper could follow.\n\nThe Blum axioms can be used to define an abstract computational complexity theory on the set of computable functions. In computational complexity theory, the problem of determining the complexity of a computable function is known as a function problem.\n\nDefinition\n\nComputability of a function is an informal notion. One way to describe it is to say that a function is computable if its value can be obtained by an effective procedure. With more rigor, a function \nis computable if and only if there is an effective procedure that, given any -tuple  of natural numbers, will produce the value . In agreement with this definition, the remainder of this article presumes that computable functions take finitely many natural numbers as arguments and produce a value which is a single natural number.\n\nAs counterparts to this informal description, there exist multiple formal, mathematical definitions. The class of computable functions can be defined in many equivalent models of computation, including\n Turing machines\n μ-recursive functions\n Lambda calculus\n Post machines (Post–Turing machines and tag machines).\n Register machines\nAlthough these models use different representations for the functions, their inputs and their outputs, translations exist between any two models, and so every model describes essentially the same class of functions, giving rise to the opinion that formal computability is both natural and not too narrow.\n\nFor example, one can formalize computable functions as μ-recursive functions, which are partial functions that take finite tuples of natural numbers and return a single natural number (just as above).  They are the smallest class of partial functions that includes the constant, successor, and projection functions, and is closed under composition, primitive recursion, and the μ operator.\n\nEquivalently, computable functions can be formalized as functions which can be calculated by an idealized computing agent such as a Turing machine or a register machine. Formally speaking, a partial function  can be calculated if and only if there exists a computer program with the following properties:\n If  is defined, then the program will terminate on the input  with the value  stored in the computer memory.\n If  is undefined, then the program never terminates on the input .\n\n Characteristics of computable functions \n\nThe basic characteristic of a computable function is that there must be a finite procedure (an algorithm) telling how to compute the function.  The models of computation listed above give different interpretations of what a procedure is and how it is used, but these interpretations share many properties.  The fact that these models give equivalent classes of computable functions stems from the fact that each model is capable of reading and mimicking a procedure for any of the other models, much as a compiler is able to read instructions in one computer language and emit instructions in another language.\n\nEnderton [1977] gives the following characteristics of a procedure for computing a computable function; similar characterizations have been given by Turing [1936], Rogers [1967], and others.\n \"There must be exact instructions (i.e. a program), finite in length, for the procedure.\" Thus every computable function must have a finite program that completely describes how the function is to be computed.  It is possible to compute the function by just following the instructions; no guessing or special insight is required.\n \"If the procedure is given a k-tuple x in the domain of f, then after a finite number of discrete steps the procedure must terminate and produce f(x).\" Intuitively, the procedure proceeds step by step, with a specific rule to cover what to do at each step of the calculation.  Only finitely many steps can be carried out before the value of the function is returned.\n \"If the procedure is given a k-tuple x which is not in the domain of f, then the procedure might go on forever, never halting.  Or it might get stuck at some point (i.e., one of its instructions cannot be executed), but it must not pretend to produce a value for f at x.\" Thus if a value for f(x) is ever found, it must be the correct value. It is not necessary for the computing agent to distinguish correct outcomes from incorrect ones because the procedure is defined as correct if and only if it produces an outcome.\n\nEnderton goes on to list several clarifications of these 3 requirements of the procedure for a computable function:\n The procedure must theoretically work for arbitrarily large arguments. It is not assumed that the arguments are smaller than the number of atoms in the Earth, for example.\n The procedure is required to halt after finitely many steps in order to produce an output, but it may take arbitrarily many steps before halting. No time limitation is assumed.\n Although the procedure may use only a finite amount of storage space during a successful computation, there is no bound on the amount of space that is used.  It is assumed that additional storage space can be given to the procedure whenever the procedure asks for it.\n\nTo summarise, based on this view a function is computable if: (a) given an input from its domain, possibly relying on unbounded storage space, it can give the corresponding output by following a procedure (program, algorithm) that is formed by a finite number of exact unambiguous instructions; (b) it returns such output (halts) in a finite number of steps; and (c) if given an input which is not in its domain it either never halts or it gets stuck.\n\nThe field of computational complexity studies functions with prescribed bounds on the time and/or space allowed in a successful computation.\n\n Computable sets and relations \n\nA set  of natural numbers is called computable (synonyms: recursive, decidable) if there is a computable, total function  such that for any natural number ,  if  is in  and  if  is not in .\n\nA set of natural numbers is called computably enumerable (synonyms: recursively enumerable, semidecidable) if there is a computable function  such that for each number ,  is defined if and only if  is in the set.  Thus a set is computably enumerable if and only if it is the domain of some computable function.  The word enumerable is used because the following are equivalent for a nonempty subset  of the natural numbers:\n  is the domain of a computable function.\n  is the range of a total computable function.  If  is infinite then the function can be assumed to be injective.\nIf a set  is the range of a function  then the function can be viewed as an\nenumeration of , because the list  will include every element of .\n\nBecause each finitary relation on the natural numbers can be identified with a corresponding set of finite sequences of natural numbers, the notions of computable relation and computably enumerable relation can be defined from their analogues for sets.\n\n  Formal languages \nIn computability theory in computer science, it is common to consider formal languages.   An alphabet is an arbitrary set.  A word on an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet; the same symbol may be used more than once.  For example, binary strings are exactly the words on the alphabet .  A language is a subset of the collection of all words on a fixed alphabet. For example, the collection of all binary strings that contain exactly 3 ones is a language over the binary alphabet.\n\nA key property of a formal language is the level of difficulty required to decide whether a given word is in the language.  Some coding system must be developed to allow a computable function to take an arbitrary word in the language as input; this is usually considered routine.  A language is called computable (synonyms: recursive, decidable) if there is a computable function  such that for each word  over the alphabet,  if the word is in the language and  if the word is not in the language. Thus a language is computable just in case there is a procedure that is able to correctly tell whether arbitrary words are in the language.\n\nA language is computably enumerable (synonyms: recursively enumerable, semidecidable) if there is a computable function  such that  is defined if and only if the word  is in the language.  The term enumerable has the same etymology as in computably enumerable sets of natural numbers.\n\nExamples\n\nThe following functions are computable:\n\n Each function with a finite domain; e.g., any finite sequence of natural numbers.\n Each constant function f : Nk → N,  f(n1,...nk) := n.\n Addition f : N2 → N, f(n1,n2) := n1 + n2\n The function which gives the list of prime factors of a number.\n The greatest common divisor of two numbers is a computable function.\n Bézout's identity, a linear Diophantine equation\n\nIf f and g are computable, then so are: f + g, f * g,  iff is unary, max(f,g), min(f,g), arg max{y ≤ f(x)}  and many more combinations.\n\nThe following examples illustrate that a function may be computable though it is not known which algorithm computes it.\n\n The function f such that f(n) = 1 if there is a sequence of at least n consecutive fives in the decimal expansion of π, and f(n) = 0 otherwise, is computable. (The function f is either the constant 1 function, which is computable, or else there is a k such that f(n) = 1 if n < k and f(n) = 0 if n ≥ k.  Every such function is computable.  It is not known whether there are arbitrarily long runs of fives in the decimal expansion of π, so we don't know which of those functions is f.  Nevertheless, we know that the function f must be computable.)\n Each finite segment of an uncomputable sequence of natural numbers (such as the Busy Beaver function Σ) is computable.  E.g., for each natural number n, there exists an algorithm that computes the finite sequence Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), ..., Σ(n) — in contrast to the fact that there is no algorithm that computes the entire Σ-sequence, i.e. Σ(n) for all n. Thus, \"Print 0, 1, 4, 6, 13\" is a trivial algorithm to compute Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), Σ(3), Σ(4); similarly, for any given value of n, such a trivial algorithm exists (even though it may never be known or produced by anyone) to compute Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), ..., Σ(n).\n\n Church–Turing thesis \n\nThe Church–Turing thesis states that any function computable from a procedure possessing the three properties listed above is a computable function.  Because these three properties are not formally stated, the Church–Turing thesis cannot be proved.  The following facts are often taken as evidence for the thesis:\n Many equivalent models of computation are known, and they all give the same definition of computable function (or a weaker version, in some instances).\n No stronger model of computation which is generally considered to be effectively calculable has been proposed.\n\nThe Church–Turing thesis is sometimes used in proofs to justify that a particular function is computable by giving a concrete description of a procedure for the computation.  This is permitted because it is believed that all such uses of the thesis can be removed by the tedious process of writing a formal procedure for the function in some model of computation.\n\n Provability \n\nGiven a function (or, similarly, a set), one may be interested not only if it is computable, but also whether this can be proven in a particular proof system (usually first order Peano arithmetic). A function that can be proven to be computable is called provably total.\n\nThe set of provably total functions is recursively enumerable: one can enumerate all the provably total functions by enumerating all their corresponding proofs, that prove their computability. This can be done by enumerating all the proofs of the proof system and ignoring irrelevant ones.\n\n Relation to recursively defined functions \n\nIn a function defined by a recursive definition, each value is defined by a fixed first-order formula of other, previously defined values of the same function or other functions, which might be simply constants. A subset of these is the primitive recursive functions. Every such function is provably total: For such a k-ary function f, each value  can be computed by following the definition backwards, iteratively, and after finite number of iteration (as can be easily proven), a constant is reached.\n\nThe converse is not true, as not every provably total function is primitive recursive. Indeed, one can enumerate all the primitive recursive functions and define a function en such that for all n, m: en(n,m) = fn(m), where fn is the n-th primitive recursive function (for k-ary functions, this will be set to fn(m,m...m)). Now, g(n) = en(n,n)+1 is provably total but not primitive recursive, by a diagonalization argument: had there been a j such that g = fj, we would have got g(j) = en(j,j)+1 = fj (j)+1= g(j)+1, a contradiction. (The Gödel numbers of all primitive recursive functions can be enumerated by a primitive recursive function, though the primitive recursive functions' values cannot.)\n\nOne such function, which is provable total but not primitive recursive, is Ackermann function: since it is recursively defined, it is indeed easy to prove its computability (However, a similar diagonalization argument can also be built for all functions defined by recursive definition; thus, there are provable total functions that cannot be defined recursively ).\n\n Total functions that are not provably total \n\nIn a sound proof system, every provably total function is indeed total, but the converse is not true: in every first-order proof system that is strong enough and sound (including Peano arithmetic), one can prove (in another proof system) the existence of total functions that cannot be proven total in the proof system.\n\nIf the total computable functions are enumerated via the Turing machines that produces them, then the above statement can be shown, if the proof system is sound, by a similar diagonalization argument to that used above, using the enumeration of provably total functions given earlier. One uses a Turing machine that enumerates the relevant proofs, and for every input n calls  fn(n) (where fn is n-th function by this enumeration) by invoking the Turing machine that computes it according to the n-th proof. Such a Turing machine is guaranteed to halt if the proof system is sound.\n\n Uncomputable functions and unsolvable problems \n\nEvery computable function has a finite procedure giving explicit, unambiguous instructions on how to compute it. Furthermore, this procedure has to be encoded in the finite alphabet used by the computational model, so there are only countably many computable functions. For example, functions may be encoded using a string of bits (the alphabet }).\n\nThe real numbers are uncountable so most real numbers are not computable.  See computable number. The set of finitary functions on the natural numbers is uncountable so most are not computable.  Concrete examples of such functions are Busy beaver, Kolmogorov complexity, or any function that outputs the digits of a noncomputable number, such as Chaitin's constant.\n\nSimilarly, most subsets of the natural numbers are not computable. The halting problem was the first such set to be constructed. The Entscheidungsproblem, proposed by David Hilbert, asked whether there is an effective procedure to determine which mathematical statements (coded as natural numbers) are true.  Turing and Church independently showed in the 1930s that this set of natural numbers is not computable.  According to the Church–Turing thesis, there is no effective procedure (with an algorithm) which can perform these computations.\n\nExtensions of computability\n\nRelative computability\n\nThe notion of computability of a function can be relativized to an arbitrary set of natural numbers A.  A function f is defined to be computable in A (equivalently A-computable or computable relative to A) when it satisfies the definition of a computable function with modifications allowing access to A as an oracle.  As with the concept of a computable function relative computability can be given equivalent definitions in many different models of computation.  This is commonly accomplished by supplementing the model of computation with an additional primitive operation which asks whether a given integer is a member of A.  We can also talk about f being computable in g by identifying g with its graph.\n\nHigher recursion theory\n\nHyperarithmetical theory studies those sets that can be computed from a computable ordinal number of iterates of the Turing jump of the empty set.  This is equivalent to sets defined by both a universal and existential formula in the language of second order arithmetic and to some models of Hypercomputation.  Even more general recursion theories have been studied, such as E-recursion theory in which any set can be used as an argument to an E-recursive function.\n\nHyper-computation\nAlthough the Church–Turing thesis states that the computable functions include all functions with algorithms, it is possible to consider broader classes of functions that relax the requirements that algorithms must possess.  The field of Hypercomputation studies models of computation that go beyond normal Turing computation.\n\n See also \n\n Computable number\n Effective method\n Theory of computation\n Recursion theory\n Turing degree\n Arithmetical hierarchy\n Hypercomputation\n Super-recursive algorithm\n Semicomputable function\n\nReferences\n\nCutland, Nigel.

      "text": "In mathematical logic, a conservative extension is a supertheory of a theory which is often convenient for proving theorems, but proves no new theorems about the language of the original theory. Similarly, a non-conservative extension is a supertheory which is not conservative, and can prove more theorems than the original.\n\nMore formally stated, a theory  is a (proof theoretic) conservative extension of a theory  if every theorem of  is a theorem of , and any theorem of  in the language of  is already a theorem of .\n\nMore generally, if  is a set of formulas in the common language of  and , then  is -conservative over  if every formula from  provable in  is also provable in .\n\nNote that a conservative extension of a consistent theory is consistent. [If it were not, then by the principle of explosion, every formula in the language of  would be a theorem of , so every formula in the language of  would be a theorem of , so  would not be consistent.] Hence, conservative extensions do not bear the risk of introducing new inconsistencies. This can also be seen as a methodology for writing and structuring large theories: start with a theory, , that is known (or assumed) to be consistent, and successively build conservative extensions , , ... of it.\n\nThe theorem provers Isabelle and ACL2 adopt this methodology by providing a language for conservative extensions by definition.\n\nRecently, conservative extensions have been used for defining a notion of module for ontologies: if an ontology is formalized as a logical theory, a subtheory is a module if the whole ontology is a conservative extension of the subtheory.\n\nAn extension which is not conservative may be called a proper extension.\n\nExamples\n ACA0 (a subsystem of second-order arithmetic) is a conservative extension of first-order Peano arithmetic.\n Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory is a conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).\n Internal set theory is a conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).\n Extensions by definitions are conservative.\n Extensions by unconstrained predicate or function symbols are conservative.\n IΣ1 (a subsystem of Peano arithmetic with induction only for Σ01-formulas) is a Π02-conservative extension of the primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA).Fernando Ferreira, A Simple Proof of Parsons’ Theorem.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve",
      "text": "right|thumb|A parabola, one of the simplest curves, after (straight) lines\n\nIn mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a line but that need not be straight. Thus, a curve is a generalization of a line, in that it may be curved. \n\nIntuitively, a curve may be thought as the trace left by a moving point. This is the definition that appeared, more 2000 years, ago in Euclid's Elements: \"The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width.\"In (rather old) French: \"La ligne est la première espece de quantité, laquelle a tant seulement une dimension à sçavoir longitude, sans aucune latitude ni profondité, & n'est autre chose que le flux ou coulement du poinct, lequel […] laissera de son mouvement imaginaire quelque vestige en long, exempt de toute latitude.\" Pages 7 and 8 of Les quinze livres des éléments géométriques d'Euclide Megarien, traduits de Grec en François, & augmentez de plusieurs figures & demonstrations, avec la corrections des erreurs commises és autres traductions, by Pierre Mardele, Lyon, MDCXLV (1645).\n\nThis definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of a continuous function from an interval to a topological space. In some context, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve. In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves for distinguishing them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations.\n\nNevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot been drawn. This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. For insuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said a differentiable curve.\n\nA plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field , the curve is said to be defined over . In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where  is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topologically point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.\n\nHistory\nthumb|225px|Megalithic art from Newgrange showing an early interest in curves\nInterest in curves began long before they were the subject of mathematical study.  This can be seen in numerous examples of their decorative use in art and on everyday objects dating back to prehistoric\ntimes.Lockwood p. ix Curves, or at least their graphical representations, are simple to create, for example by a stick in the sand on a beach.\n\nHistorically, the term  was used in place of the more modern term . Hence the phrases  and  were used to distinguish what are today called lines from curved lines. For example, in Book I of Euclid's Elements, a line is defined as a \"breadthless length\" (Def. 2), while a  line is defined as \"a line that lies evenly with the points on itself\" (Def. 4). Euclid's idea of a line is perhaps clarified by the statement \"The extremities of a line are points,\" (Def. 3).Heath p. 153 Later commentators further classified lines according to various schemes. For example:Heath p. 160\nComposite lines (lines forming an angle)\nIncomposite lines\nDeterminate (lines that do not extend indefinitely, such as the circle)\nIndeterminate (lines that extend indefinitely, such as the straight line and the parabola)\n\nthumb|225px|The curves created by slicing a cone (conic sections) were among the curves studied in ancient Greece.\nThe Greek geometers had studied many other kinds of curves. One reason was their interest in solving geometrical problems that could not be solved using standard compass and straightedge construction.\nThese curves include:\nThe conic sections, deeply studied by Apollonius of Perga\nThe cissoid of Diocles, studied by Diocles and used as a method to double the cube.Lockwood p. 132\nThe conchoid of Nicomedes, studied by Nicomedes as a method to both double the cube and to trisect an angle.Lockwood p. 129\nThe Archimedean spiral, studied by Archimedes as a method to trisect an angle and square the circle.\nThe spiric sections, sections of tori studied by Perseus as sections of cones had been studied by Apollonius.\n\nthumb|225px|left|Analytic geometry allowed curves, such as the Folium of Descartes, to be defined using equations instead of geometrical construction.\nA fundamental advance in the theory of curves was the introduction of analytic geometry by René Descartes in the seventeenth century. This enabled a curve to be described using an equation rather than an elaborate geometrical construction. This not only allowed new curves to be defined and studied, but it enabled a formal distinction to be made between algebraic curves curves that can be defined using polynomial equations, and transcendental curves that cannot. Previously, curves had been described as \"geometrical\" or \"mechanical\" according to how they were, or supposedly could be, generated.\n\nConic sections were applied in astronomy by Kepler.\nNewton also worked on an early example in the calculus of variations. Solutions to variational problems, such as the brachistochrone and tautochrone questions, introduced properties of curves in new ways (in this case, the cycloid). The catenary gets its name as the solution to the problem of a hanging chain, the sort of question that became routinely accessible by means of differential calculus.\n\nIn the eighteenth century came the beginnings of the theory of plane algebraic curves, in general. Newton had studied the cubic curves, in the general description of the real points into 'ovals'. The statement of Bézout's theorem showed a number of aspects which were not directly accessible to the geometry of the time, to do with singular points and complex solutions.\n\nSince the nineteenth century, curve theory is viewed as the special case of dimension one of the theory of manifolds and algebraic varieties. Nevertheless, many questions remain specific to curves, such as space-filling curves, Jordan curve theorem and Hilbert's sixteenth problem.\n\nTopological curve\nA topological curve can be specified by a continuous function  from an interval  of the real numbers into a topological space . Properly speaking, the curve is the image of  However, in some contexts, this is  which is called a curve, specially when the image does not looks like what is generally called a curve, and does not characterize sufficiently  \n\nFor example, the image of the Peano curve or, more generally, a space-filling curve completely fills a square, and therefore does not gives any information on how  is defined.\n\nA curve  is closedThis term my be ambiguous, as a non-closed curve may be a closed set, as is a line in a plane or is a loop if  and .  A closed curve is thus the image of a continuous mapping of a circle.\n\nIf the domain of  is a closed and bounded interval  the curve is also called a path or an arc.\n\nA curve is  if it is the image of an interval or a circle by an injective continuous function. In other words, if a curve is defined by a continuous function  with an interval as a domain, the curve is simple if and only if two different points of the interval have different images, except, possibly, if the points are the end points of the interval. Intuitively, a simple curve is a curve that \"does not cross itself and has no missing points\".\n\nthumb|A dragon curve with a positive area\nA simple closed curve is also called a Jordan curve. The Jordan curve theorem states that the set complement in a plane of a Jordan curve consists of two connected components (that is the curve divides the plane in two non-intersecting regions that are both connected). \n\nA plane curve is a curve for which  is the Euclidean plane—these are the examples first encountered—or in some cases the projective plane. A  is a curve for which  is at least three-dimensional; a   is a space curve which lies in no plane. These definitions of plane, space and skew curves apply also to real algebraic curves, although the above definition of a curve does not apply (a real algebraic curve may be disconnected).\n\nThe definition of a curve  includes figures that can hardly be called curves in common usage. For example, the image of a simple curve can cover a square in the plane (space-filling curve) and thus have a positive area. Fractal curves can have properties that are strange for the common sense. For example, a  fractal curve can have a Hausdorff dimension bigger than one (see Koch snowflake) and even a positive area. An example is the dragon curve, which has many other unusual properties.\n\nDifferentiable curve\nRoughly speaking a  is a curve that is defined as being locally the image of an injective differentiable function  from an interval  of the real numbers into a differentiable manifold , often \n\nMore precisely, a differentiable curve is a subset  of  where every point of  has a neighborhood  such that  is diffeomorphic to an interval of the real numbers. In other words, a differentiable curve is a differentiable manifold of dimension one.\n\nLength of a curve\n\nIf  is the -dimensional Euclidean space, and if  is an injective and continuously differentiable function, then the length of  is defined as the quantity\n\nThe length of a curve is independent of the parametrization .\n\nIn particular, the length  of the graph of a continuously differentiable function  defined on a closed interval  is\n\nMore generally, if  is a metric space with metric , then we can define the length of a curve  by\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over all  and all partitions  of .\n\nA rectifiable curve is a curve with finite length. A curve  is called  (or unit-speed or parametrized by arc length) if for any  such that , we have\n\nIf  is a Lipschitz-continuous function, then it is automatically rectifiable. Moreover, in this case, one can define the speed (or metric derivative) of  at  as\n\nand then show that\n\nDifferential geometry\n\nWhile the first examples of curves that are met are mostly plane curves (that is, in everyday words, curved lines in two-dimensional space), there are obvious examples such as the helix which exist naturally in three dimensions. The needs of geometry, and also for example classical mechanics are to have a notion of curve in space of any number of dimensions. In general relativity, a world line is a curve in spacetime.\n\nIf  is a differentiable manifold, then we can define the notion of differentiable curve in . This general idea is enough to cover many of the applications of curves in mathematics. From a local point of view one can take  to be Euclidean space. On the other hand, it is useful to be more general, in that (for example) it is possible to define the tangent vectors to  by means of this notion of curve.\n\nIf  is a smooth manifold, a smooth curve in  is a smooth map\n\n.\n\nThis is a basic notion. There are less and more restricted ideas, too. If  is a  manifold (i.e., a manifold whose charts are  times continuously differentiable), then a  curve in  is such a curve which is only assumed to be  (i.e.  times continuously differentiable).  If  is an analytic manifold (i.e. infinitely differentiable and charts are expressible as power series), and  is an analytic map, then  is said to be an analytic curve.\n\nA differentiable curve is said to be regular if its derivative never vanishes. (In words, a regular curve never slows to a stop or backtracks on itself.)  Two  differentiable curves\n\n and\n\nare said to be equivalent if there is a bijective  map\n\nsuch that the inverse map\n\nis also , and\n\nfor all .  The map  is called a reparametrisation of ; and this makes an equivalence relation on the set of all  differentiable curves in .  A  arc is an equivalence class of  curves under the relation of reparametrisation.\n\nAlgebraic curve\n\nAlgebraic curves are the curves considered in algebraic geometry. A plane algebraic curve is the set of the points of coordinates  such that , where  is a polynomial in two variables defined over some field . One says that the curve is defined over . Algebraic geometry normally looks not only on points with coordinates in  but on all the points with coordinates in an algebraically closed field . \n\nIf C is a curve defined by a polynomial f with coefficients in F, the curve is said to be defined over F. \n\nIn the case of a curve defined over the real numbers, one normally looks on points with complex coordinates. In this case, a point with real coordinates is a real point, and the set of all real points is the real part of the curve. So, it is only the real part of an algebraic curve that can be a topological curve (this is not always the cases, sa the real part of an algebraic curve may be disconnected and contain isolated points). The whole curve, that is the set of its complex point is, from the topological point of view a surface. In particular, the nonsingular complex projective algebraic curves are called Riemann surfaces.\n\nThe points of a curve  with coordinates in a field  are said to be rational over  and can be denoted . When  is the field of the rational numbers, one simply talks of rational points. For example, Fermat's Last Theorem may be restated as: For , every rational point of the Fermat curve of degree  has a zero coordinate.\n\nAlgebraic curves can also be space curves, or curves in a space of higher dimension, say . They are defined as algebraic varieties of dimension one. They may be obtained as the common solutions of at least  polynomial equations in  variables. If  polynomials are sufficient to define a curve in a space of dimension , the curve is said to be a complete intersection. By eliminating variables (by any tool of elimination theory), an algebraic curve may be projected onto a plane algebraic curve, which however may introduce new singularities such as cusps or double points.\n\nA plane curve may also be completed in a curve in the projective plane: if a curve is defined by a polynomial  of total degree , then  simplifies to a homogeneous polynomial  of degree . The values of  such that  are the homogeneous coordinates of the points of the completion of the curve in the projective plane and the points of the initial curve are those such that  is not zero. An example is the Fermat curve , which has an affine form . A similar process of homogenization may be defined for curves in higher dimensional spaces.\n\nExcept for lines, the simplest examples of algebraic curves are the conics, which are nonsingular curves of degree two and genus zero. Elliptic curves, which are nonsingular curves of genus one are studied in number theory, and have important applications to cryptography.\n\nSee also\n\nCoordinate curve\nCurve orientation\nCurve sketching\nDifferential geometry of curves\nGallery of curves\nImplicit curve\nList of curves topics\nList of curves\nOsculating circle\nParametric surface\nPath (topology)\nPosition vector\nVector-valued function\nCurve fitting\nWinding number\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n Euclid, commentary and trans. by T.

      "text": "In mathematics, the epsilon numbers are a collection of transfinite numbers whose defining property is that they are fixed points of an  exponential map. Consequently, they are not reachable from 0 via a finite series of applications of the chosen exponential map and of \"weaker\" operations like addition and multiplication.  The original epsilon numbers were introduced by Georg Cantor in the context of ordinal arithmetic; they are the ordinal numbers ε that satisfy the equation\n\nin which ω is the smallest infinite ordinal.  \n\nThe least such ordinal is ε0 (pronounced epsilon nought or epsilon zero), which can be viewed as the \"limit\" obtained by transfinite recursion from a sequence of smaller limit ordinals:\n\nLarger ordinal fixed points of the exponential map are indexed by ordinal subscripts, resulting in .  The ordinal ε0 is still countable, as is any epsilon number whose index is countable (there exist uncountable ordinals, and uncountable epsilon numbers whose index is an uncountable ordinal).\n\nThe smallest epsilon number ε0 appears in many induction proofs, because for many purposes, transfinite induction is only required up to ε0 (as in Gentzen's consistency proof and the proof of Goodstein's theorem).  Its use by Gentzen to prove the consistency of Peano arithmetic, along with Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, show that Peano arithmetic cannot prove the well-foundedness of this ordering (it is in fact the least ordinal with this property, and as such, in proof-theoretic ordinal analysis, is used as a measure of the strength of the theory of Peano arithmetic).\n\nMany larger epsilon numbers can be defined using the Veblen function.\n\nA more general class of epsilon numbers has been identified by John Horton Conway and Donald Knuth in the surreal number system, consisting of all surreals that are fixed points of the base ω exponential map x → ωx.\n\n defined gamma numbers (see additively indecomposable ordinal) to be numbers γ>0 such that α+γ=γ whenever α<γ, and delta numbers (see additively indecomposable ordinal#Multiplicatively indecomposable) to be numbers δ>1 such that  αδ=δ whenever 0<α<δ, and epsilon numbers to be numbers ε>2 such that  αε=ε whenever 1<α<ε. His gamma numbers are those of the form ωβ, and his delta numbers are those of the form ωωβ.\n\n Ordinal ε numbers \n\nThe standard definition of ordinal exponentiation with base α is:\n\n for limit .\n\nFrom this definition, it follows that for any fixed ordinal α > 1, the mapping   is a normal function, so it has arbitrarily large fixed points by the fixed-point lemma for normal functions.  When , these fixed points are precisely the ordinal epsilon numbers.  The smallest of these, ε₀, is the supremum of the sequence\n\nin which every element is the image of its predecessor under the mapping .  (The general term is given using Knuth's up-arrow notation; the  operator is equivalent to tetration.)  Just as ωω is defined as the supremum of { ωk } for natural numbers k, the smallest ordinal epsilon number ε₀ may also be denoted ; this notation is much less common than ε₀.\n\nThe next epsilon number after  is\n\nin which the sequence is again constructed by repeated base ω exponentiation but starts at  instead of at 0. Notice\n\nA different sequence with the same supremum, , is obtained by starting from 0 and exponentiating with base ε₀ instead:\n\nThe epsilon number  indexed by any successor ordinal α+1 is constructed similarly, by base ω exponentiation starting from  (or by base  exponentiation starting from 0).\n\nAn epsilon number indexed by a limit ordinal α is constructed differently.  The number  is the supremum of the set of epsilon numbers .  The first such number is .  Whether or not the index α is a limit ordinal,  is a fixed point not only of base ω exponentiation but also of base γ exponentiation for all ordinals .\n\nSince the epsilon numbers are an unbounded subclass of the ordinal numbers, they are enumerated using the ordinal numbers themselves.  For any ordinal number ,  is the least epsilon number (fixed point of the exponential map) not already in the set . It might appear that this is the non-constructive equivalent of the constructive definition using iterated exponentiation; but the two definitions are equally non-constructive at steps indexed by limit ordinals, which represent transfinite recursion of a higher order than taking the supremum of an exponential series.\n\nThe following facts about epsilon numbers are very straightforward to prove:\n Although it is quite a large number,  is still countable, being a countable union of countable ordinals; in fact,  is countable if and only if  is countable.\n The union (or supremum) of any nonempty set of epsilon numbers is an epsilon number; so for instance\n\n is an epsilon number.  Thus, the mapping  is a normal function.\n The initial ordinal of any uncountable cardinal is an epsilon number.\n\n Representation of  by rooted trees \n\nAny epsilon number ε has Cantor normal form , which means that the Cantor normal form is not very useful for epsilon numbers. The ordinals less than ε0, however, can be usefully described by their Cantor normal forms, which leads to a representation of ε0 as the ordered set of all finite rooted trees, as follows.  Any ordinal  has Cantor normal form  where k is a natural number and   are ordinals with , uniquely determined by . Each of the ordinals  in turn has a similar Cantor normal form. We obtain the finite rooted tree representing α by joining the roots of the trees representing  to a new root. (This has the consequence that the number 0 is represented by a single root while the number  is represented by a tree containing a root and a single leaf.) An order on the set of finite rooted trees is defined recursively: we first order the subtrees joined to the root in decreasing order, and then use lexicographic order on these ordered sequences of subtrees. In this way the set of all finite rooted trees becomes a well-ordered set which is order-isomorphic to ε0.\n\nVeblen hierarchy\n\nThe fixed points of the \"epsilon mapping\"  form a normal function, whose fixed points form a normal function, whose …; this is known as the Veblen hierarchy (the Veblen functions with base φ0(α) = ωα).  In the notation of the Veblen hierarchy, the epsilon mapping is φ1, and its fixed points are enumerated by φ2.\n\nContinuing in this vein, one can define maps φα for progressively larger ordinals α (including, by this rarefied form of transfinite recursion, limit ordinals), with progressively larger least fixed points φα+1(0).  The least ordinal not reachable from 0 by this procedure—i. e., the least ordinal α for which φα(0)=α, or equivalently the first fixed point of the map —is the Feferman–Schütte ordinal Γ0.  In a set theory where such an ordinal can be proven to exist, one has a map Γ that enumerates the fixed points Γ0, Γ1, Γ2, ... of ; these are all still epsilon numbers, as they lie in the image of φβ for every β ≤ Γ0, including of the map φ1 that enumerates epsilon numbers.\n\n Surreal ε numbers \n\nIn On Numbers and Games, the classic exposition on surreal numbers, John Horton Conway provided a number of examples of concepts that had natural extensions from the ordinals to the surreals.  One such function is the -map ; this mapping generalises naturally to include all surreal numbers in its domain, which in turn provides a natural generalisation of the Cantor normal form for surreal numbers.\n\nIt is natural to consider any fixed point of this expanded map to be an epsilon number, whether or not it happens to be strictly an ordinal number.  Some examples of non-ordinal epsilon numbers are\n\nand\n\nThere is a natural way to define  for every surreal number n, and the map remains order-preserving.  Conway goes on to define a broader class of \"irreducible\" surreal numbers that includes the epsilon numbers as a particularly-interesting subclass.\n\n See also \nOrdinal arithmetic\nLarge countable ordinal\n\nReferences\n J.H.

      "text": "In mathematics, the exterior product or wedge product of vectors is an algebraic construction used in geometry to study areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogues. The exterior product of two vectors u and v, denoted by , is called a bivector and lives in a space called the exterior square, a vector space that is distinct from the original space of vectors.  The magnitudeStrictly speaking, the magnitude depends on some additional structure, namely that the vectors be in a Euclidean space.  We do not generally assume that this structure is available, except where it is helpful to develop intuition on the subject. of  can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides u and v, which in three dimensions can also be computed using the cross product of the two vectors. Like the cross product, the exterior product is anticommutative, meaning that  for all vectors u and v, but, unlike the cross product, the exterior product is associative.  One way to visualize a bivector is as a family of parallelograms all lying in the same plane, having the same area, and with the same orientation—a choice of clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nWhen regarded in this manner, the exterior product of two vectors is called a 2-blade.  More generally, the exterior product of any number k of vectors can be defined and is sometimes called a k-blade.  It lives in a space known as the kth exterior power.  The magnitude of the resulting k-blade is the volume of the k-dimensional parallelotope whose edges are the given vectors, just as the magnitude of the scalar triple product of vectors in three dimensions gives the volume of the parallelepiped generated by those vectors.\n\nThe exterior algebra, or Grassmann algebra after Hermann Grassmann, introduced these as extended algebras (cf. ). He used the word äußere (literally translated as outer, or exterior) only to indicate the produkt he defined, which is nowadays conventionally called exterior product, probably to distinguish it from the outer product as defined in modern linear algebra. is the algebraic system whose product is the exterior product.  The exterior algebra provides an algebraic setting in which to answer geometric questions.  For instance, blades have a concrete geometric interpretation, and objects in the exterior algebra can be manipulated according to a set of unambiguous rules. The exterior algebra contains objects that are not only k-blades, but sums of k-blades; such a sum is called a k-vector.The term k-vector is not equivalent to and should not be confused with similar terms such as 4-vector, which in a different context could mean a 4-dimensional vector. A minority of authors use the term k-multivector instead of k-vector, which avoids this confusion.  The k-blades, because they are simple products of vectors, are called the simple elements of the algebra.  The rank of any k-vector is defined to be the smallest number of simple elements of which it is a sum.  The exterior product extends to the full exterior algebra, so that it makes sense to multiply any two elements of the algebra.  Equipped with this product, the exterior algebra is an associative algebra, which means that  for any elements α, β, γ.  The k-vectors have degree k, meaning that they are sums of products of k vectors.  When elements of different degrees are multiplied, the degrees add like multiplication of polynomials.  This means that the exterior algebra is a graded algebra.\n\nThe definition of the exterior algebra makes sense for spaces not just of geometric vectors, but of other vector-like objects such as vector fields or functions.  In full generality, the exterior algebra can be defined for modules over a commutative ring, and for other structures of interest in abstract algebra.  It is one of these more general constructions where the exterior algebra finds one of its most important applications, where it appears as the algebra of differential forms that is fundamental in areas that use differential geometry.  Differential forms are mathematical objects that evaluate the length of infinitesimal vectors, areas of infinitesimal parallelograms, and volumes of higher-dimensional bodies, so they can be integrated over curves, surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds in a way that generalizes the line integrals and surface integrals from calculus. The exterior algebra also has many algebraic properties that make it a convenient tool in algebra itself.  The association of the exterior algebra to a vector space is a type of functor on vector spaces, which means that it is compatible in a certain way with linear transformations of vector spaces. The exterior algebra is one example of a bialgebra, meaning that its dual space also possesses a product, and this dual product is compatible with the exterior product. This dual algebra is precisely the algebra of alternating multilinear forms,  and the pairing between the exterior algebra and its dual is given by the interior product.\n\nMotivating examples\n\nAreas in the plane\nthumb|right|The area of a parallelogram in terms of the determinant of the matrix of coordinates of two of its vertices.\n\nThe Cartesian plane R2 is a vector space equipped with a basis consisting of a pair of unit vectors\n\nSuppose that\n\nare a pair of given vectors in R2, written in components. There is a unique parallelogram having v and w as two of its sides. The area of this parallelogram is given by the standard determinant formula:\n\nConsider now the exterior product of v and w:\n\nwhere the first step uses the distributive law for the exterior product, and the last uses the fact that the exterior product is alternating, and in particular . (Note that the fact that the exterior product is alternating also forces .) Note that the coefficient in this last expression is precisely the determinant of the matrix . The fact that this may be positive or negative has the intuitive meaning that v and w may be oriented in a counterclockwise or clockwise sense as the vertices of the parallelogram they define. Such an area is called the signed area of the parallelogram: the absolute value of the signed area is the ordinary area, and the sign determines its orientation.\n\nThe fact that this coefficient is the signed area is not an accident. In fact, it is relatively easy to see that the exterior product should be related to the signed area if one tries to axiomatize this area as an algebraic construct. In detail, if  denotes the signed area of the parallelogram of which the pair of vectors v and w form two adjacent sides, then A must satisfy the following properties:\n  for any real numbers j and k, since rescaling either of the sides rescales the area by the same amount (and reversing the direction of one of the sides reverses the orientation of the parallelogram).\n , since the area of the degenerate parallelogram determined by v (i.e., a line segment) is zero.\n , since interchanging the roles of v and w reverses the orientation of the parallelogram.\n , for real j, since adding a multiple of w to v affects neither the base nor the height of the parallelogram and consequently preserves its area.\n , since the area of the unit square is one.\nWith the exception of the last property, the exterior product of two vectors satisfies the same properties as the area. In a certain sense, the exterior product generalizes the final property by allowing the area of a parallelogram to be compared to that of any \"standard\" chosen parallelogram in a parallel plane (here, the one with sides e1 and e2). In other words, the exterior product provides a basis-independent formulation of area.This axiomatization of areas is due to Leopold Kronecker and Karl Weierstrass; see . For a modern treatment, see . For an elementary treatment, see .\n\nCross and triple products\n250px|thumb|The cross product (blue vector) in relation to the exterior product (light blue parallelogram). The length of the cross product is to the length of the parallel unit vector (red) as the size of the exterior product is to the size of the reference parallelogram (light red).\n\nFor vectors in R3, the exterior algebra is closely related to the cross product and triple product. Using the standard basis  the exterior product of a pair of vectors\n\nand\n\nis\n\nwhere {e1 ∧ e2, e3 ∧ e1, e2 ∧ e3} is the basis for the three-dimensional space Λ2(R3). The coefficients above are the same as those in the usual definition of the cross product of vectors in three dimensions, the only difference being that the exterior product is not an ordinary vector, but instead is a 2-vector.\n\nBringing in a third vector\n\nthe exterior product of three vectors is\n\nwhere  is the basis vector for the one-dimensional space Λ3(R3). The scalar coefficient is the triple product of the three vectors.\n\nThe cross product and triple product in three dimensions each admit both geometric and algebraic interpretations. The cross product  can be interpreted as a vector which is perpendicular to both u and v and whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by the two vectors. It can also be interpreted as the vector consisting of the minors of the matrix with columns u and v. The triple product of u, v, and w is geometrically a (signed) volume. Algebraically, it is the determinant of the matrix with columns u, v, and w. The exterior product in three dimensions allows for similar interpretations: it, too, can be identified with oriented areas or volumes spanned by the two or three vectors involved. In fact, in the presence of a positively oriented orthonormal basis, the exterior product generalizes these geometric notions to higher dimensions.\n\nFormal definitions and algebraic properties\nThe exterior algebra  of a vector space  over a field  is defined as the quotient algebra of the tensor algebra  by the two-sided ideal  generated by all elements of the form  for  (i.e. all tensors that can be expressed as the tensor product of a vector in  by itself).. The ideal I contains the ideal J generated by elements of the form  and  these ideals coincide if (and only if) :\n . \nWe define \n\nThe exterior product  of two elements of  is the product induced by the tensor product  of . That is, if\n\nis the canonical surjection, and  and  are in , then there are  and  in  such that  and  and\n\nIt results from the definition of a quotient algebra that the value of  does not depend on a particular choice of  and . We have (in all characteristics) . \n\nAs , , and , the inclusions of  and  in  induce injections of  and  into . These injections are commonly considered as inclusions, and called natural embeddings, natural injections or natural inclusions. The word canonical is also commonly used in place of natural.\n\nAlternating product\nThe exterior product is by construction alternating on elements of V, which means that  for all , by the above construction.  It follows that the product is also anticommutative on elements of V, for supposing that ,\n\nhence\n\nMore generally, if σ is a permutation of the integers , and x1, x2, ..., xk are elements of V, it follows that\n\nwhere sgn(σ) is the signature of the permutation σ.A proof of this can be found in more generality in .\n\nIn particular, if xi = xj for some , then the following generalization of the alternating property also holds:\n\nExterior power\n\nThe kth exterior power of V, denoted Λk(V), is the vector subspace of Λ(V) spanned by elements of the form\n\nIf , then α is said to be a k-vector. If, furthermore, α can be expressed as an exterior product of k elements of V, then α is said to be decomposable. Although decomposable k-vectors span Λk(V), not every element of Λk(V) is decomposable. For example, in R4, the following 2-vector is not decomposable:\n\n(This is a symplectic form, since .See .)\n\nBasis and dimension\n\nIf the dimension of V is n and  is a basis of V, then the set\n\nis a basis for Λk(V). The reason is the following: given any exterior product of the form\n\nevery vector vj can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors ei; using the bilinearity of the exterior product, this can be expanded to a linear combination of exterior products of those basis vectors. Any exterior product in which the same basis vector appears more than once is zero; any exterior product in which the basis vectors do not appear in the proper order can be reordered, changing the sign whenever two basis vectors change places. In general, the resulting coefficients of the basis k-vectors can be computed as the minors of the matrix that describes the vectors vj in terms of the basis ei.\n\nBy counting the basis elements, the dimension of Λk(V) is equal to a binomial coefficient:\n\nIn particular,  for .\n\nAny element of the exterior algebra can be written as a sum of k-vectors. Hence, as a vector space the exterior algebra is a direct sum\n\n(where by convention  and ), and therefore its dimension is equal to the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is 2n.\n\nRank of a k-vector\n\nIf , then it is possible to express α as a linear combination of decomposable k-vectors:\n\nwhere each α(i) is decomposable, say\n\nThe rank of the k-vector α is the minimal number of decomposable k-vectors in such an expansion of α. This is similar to the notion of tensor rank.\n\nRank is particularly important in the study of 2-vectors  . The rank of a 2-vector α can be identified with half the rank of the matrix of coefficients of α in a basis. Thus if ei is a basis for V, then α can be expressed uniquely as\n\nwhere  (the matrix of coefficients is skew-symmetric). The rank of the matrix aij is therefore even, and is twice the rank of the form α.\n\nIn characteristic 0, the 2-vector α has rank p if and only if\n\nand\n\nGraded structure\nThe exterior product of a k-vector with a p-vector is a -vector, once again invoking bilinearity. As a consequence, the direct sum decomposition of the preceding section\n\ngives the exterior algebra the additional structure of a graded algebra, that is\n\nMoreover, if  is the basis field, we have\n\nand\n\nThe exterior product is graded anticommutative, meaning that if  and , then\n\nIn addition to studying the graded structure on the exterior algebra,  studies additional graded structures on exterior algebras, such as those on the exterior algebra of a graded module (a module that already carries its own gradation).\n\nUniversal property\nLet  be a vector space over the field . Informally, multiplication in  is performed by manipulating symbols and imposing a distributive law, an associative law, and using the identity  for . Formally,  is the \"most general\" algebra in which these rules hold for the multiplication, in the sense that any unital associative -algebra containing  with alternating multiplication on  must contain a homomorphic image of . In other words, the exterior algebra has the following universal property:See , and . More detail on universal properties in general can be found in , and throughout the works of Bourbaki.\n\nGiven any unital associative -algebra  and any -linear map  such that  for every  in , then there exists precisely one unital algebra homomorphism  such that  for all  in  (here  is the natural inclusion of  in , see above).\n\ncenter|Universal property of the exterior algebra\n\nTo construct the most general algebra that contains  and whose multiplication is alternating on , it is natural to start with the most general associative algebra that contains , the tensor algebra , and then enforce the alternating property by taking a suitable quotient. We thus take the two-sided ideal  in  generated by all elements of the form  for  in , and define  as the quotient\n\n(and use  as the symbol for multiplication in . It is then straightforward to show that  contains  and satisfies the above universal property.\n\nAs a consequence of this construction, the operation of assigning to a vector space  its exterior algebra  is a functor from the category of vector spaces to the category of algebras.\n\nRather than defining  first and then identifying the exterior powers  as certain subspaces, one may alternatively define the spaces  first and then combine them to form the algebra . This approach is often used in differential geometry and is described in the next section.\n\nGeneralizations\n\nGiven a commutative ring R and an R-module M, we can define the exterior algebra Λ(M) just as above, as a suitable quotient of the tensor algebra T(M). It will satisfy the analogous universal property. Many of the properties of Λ(M) also require that M be a projective module. Where finite dimensionality is used, the properties further require that M be finitely generated and projective. Generalizations to the most common situations can be found in .\n\nExterior algebras of vector bundles are frequently considered in geometry and topology. There are no essential differences between the algebraic properties of the exterior algebra of finite-dimensional vector bundles and those of the exterior algebra of finitely generated projective modules, by the Serre–Swan theorem. More general exterior algebras can be defined for sheaves of modules.\n\nDuality\n\nAlternating operators\n\nGiven two vector spaces V and X, an alternating operator from Vk to X is a multilinear map\n\nsuch that whenever v1, ..., vk are linearly dependent vectors in V, then\n\nThe map\n\nwhich associates to k vectors from V their exterior product, i.e. their corresponding k-vector, is also alternating. In fact, this map is the \"most general\" alternating operator defined on Vk: given any other alternating operator , there exists a unique linear map  with . This universal property characterizes the space Λk(V) and can serve as its definition.\n\n Alternating multilinear forms \n\nthumb|125px|Geometric interpretation for the exterior product of n 1-forms (ε, η, ω) to obtain an n-form (\"mesh\" of coordinate surfaces, here planes), for . The \"circulations\" show orientation.\n\nThe above discussion specializes to the case when , the base field. In this case an alternating multilinear function\n\nis called an alternating multilinear form. The set of all alternating multilinear forms is a vector space, as the sum of two such maps, or the product of such a map with a scalar, is again alternating. By the universal property of the exterior power, the space of alternating forms of degree k on V is naturally isomorphic with the dual vector space (ΛkV)∗.  If V is finite-dimensional, then the latter is naturally isomorphic to  Λk(V∗). In particular, the dimension of the space of alternating maps from Vk to K is n choose k.\n\nUnder this identification, the exterior product takes a concrete form: it produces a new anti-symmetric map from two given ones. Suppose  and  are two anti-symmetric maps. As in the case of tensor products of multilinear maps, the number of variables of their exterior product is the sum of the numbers of their variables. It is defined as follows:Some conventions, particularly in physics, define the exterior product as\n\nThis convention is not adopted here, but is discussed in connection with alternating tensors.\n\nwhere the alternation Alt of a multilinear map is defined to be the average of the sign-adjusted values over all the permutations of its variables:\n\nThis definition of the exterior product is well-defined even if the field K has finite characteristic, if one considers an equivalent version of the above that does not use factorials or any constants:\n\nwhere here  is the subset of (k,m) shuffles: permutations σ of the set  such that , and .\n\nBialgebra structure\nThere is a correspondence between the graded dual of the graded algebra Λ(V) and alternating multilinear forms on V. The exterior algebra (as well as the symmetric algebra) inherits a bialgebra structure, and, indeed, a Hopf algebra structure, from the tensor algebra. See the article on tensor algebras for a detailed treatment of the topic.\n\nThe exterior product of multilinear forms defined above is dual to a coproduct defined on Λ(V), giving the structure of a coalgebra. The coproduct is a linear function  which is given by\n\non elements v∈V. The symbol 1 stands for the unit element of the field K. Recall that  so that the above really does lie in  This definition of the coproduct is extended to the full space Λ(V) by (linear) homomorphism. That is, for v,w∈V, one has, by definition, the homomorphism\n\nThe correct form of this homomorphism is not what one might naively write, but has to be the one carefully defined in the coalgebra article.  In this case, one obtains\n\nExtending to the full space Λ(V), one has, in general,\n\nExpanding this out in detail, one obtains the following expression on decomposable elements:\n\nwhere the second summation is taken over all -shuffles.  The above is written with a notational trick, to keep track of the field element 1: the trick is to write , and this is shuffled into various locations during the expansion of the sum over shuffles.  The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements  is preserved in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right.\n\nObserve that the coproduct preserves the grading of the algebra. That is, one has that\n\nThe tensor symbol ⊗ used in this section should be understood with some caution: it is not the same tensor symbol as the one being used in the definition of the alternating product.  Intuitively, it is perhaps easiest to think it as just another, but different, tensor product: it is still (bi-)linear, as tensor products should be, but it is the product that is appropriate for the definition of a bialgebra, that is, for creating the object  Any lingering doubt can be shaken by pondering the equalities  and , which follow from the definition of the coalgebra, as opposed to naive manipulations involving the tensor and wedge symbols. This distinction is developed in greater detail in the article on tensor algebras. Here, there is much less of a problem, in that the alternating product Λ clearly corresponds to multiplication in the bialgebra, leaving the symbol ⊗ free for use in the definition of the bialgebra. In practice, this presents no particular problem, as long as one avoids the fatal trap of replacing alternating sums of ⊗ by the wedge symbol, with one exception. One can construct an alternating product from ⊗, with the understanding that it works in a different space. Immediately below, an example is given: the alternating product for the dual space can be given in terms of the coproduct. The construction of the bialgebra here parallels the construction in the tensor algebra article almost exactly, except for the need to correctly track the alternating signs for the exterior algebra.\n\nIn terms of the coproduct, the exterior product on the dual space is just the graded dual of the coproduct:\n\nwhere the tensor product on the right-hand side is of multilinear linear maps (extended by zero on elements of incompatible homogeneous degree: more precisely, , where ε is the counit, as defined presently).\n\nThe counit is the homomorphism  that returns the 0-graded component of its argument. The coproduct and counit, along with the exterior product, define the structure of a bialgebra on the exterior algebra.\n\nWith an antipode defined on homogeneous elements by , the exterior algebra is furthermore a Hopf algebra.Indeed, the exterior algebra of V is the enveloping algebra of the abelian Lie superalgebra structure on V.\n\nInterior product\n\nSuppose that V is finite-dimensional. If V∗ denotes the dual space to the vector space V, then for each , it is possible to define an antiderivation on the algebra Λ(V),\n\nThis derivation is called the interior product with α, or sometimes the insertion operator, or contraction by α.\n\nSuppose that . Then w is a multilinear mapping of V∗ to K, so it is defined by its values on the k-fold Cartesian product . If u1, u2, ..., uk−1 are  elements of V∗, then define\n\nAdditionally, let  whenever f is a pure scalar (i.e., belonging to Λ0V).\n\nAxiomatic characterization and properties\nThe interior product satisfies the following properties:\n\n For each k and each ,\n\n(By convention, )\n If v is an element of V (= Λ1V), then  is the dual pairing between elements of V and elements of V∗.\n For each , iα is a graded derivation of degree −1:\n\nThese three properties are sufficient to characterize the interior product as well as define it in the general infinite-dimensional case.\n\nFurther properties of the interior product include:\n \n \n\nHodge duality\n\nSuppose that V has finite dimension n. Then the interior product induces a canonical isomorphism of vector spaces\n\nby the recursive definition\n\nIn the geometrical setting, a non-zero element of the top exterior power Λn(V) (which is a one-dimensional vector space) is sometimes called a volume form (or orientation form, although this term may sometimes lead to ambiguity). The name orientation form comes from the fact that a choice of preferred top element determines an orientation of the whole exterior algebra, since it is tantamount to fixing an ordered basis of the vector space. Relative to the preferred volume form σ, the isomorphism between an element and its Hodge dual is given explicitly by\n\nIf, in addition to a volume form, the vector space V is equipped with an inner product identifying V with V∗, then the resulting isomorphism is called the Hodge star operator, which maps an element to its Hodge dual:\n\nThe composition of  with itself maps  and is always a scalar multiple of the identity map. In most applications, the volume form is compatible with the inner product in the sense that it is an exterior product of an orthonormal basis of V. In this case,\n\nwhere id is the identity mapping, and the inner product has metric signature  — p pluses and q minuses.\n\nInner product\nFor V a finite-dimensional space, an inner product on V defines an isomorphism of V with V∗, and so also an isomorphism of ΛkV with (ΛkV)∗.  The pairing between these two spaces also takes the form of an inner product.  On decomposable k-vectors,\n\nthe determinant of the matrix of inner products.  In the special case , the inner product is the square norm of the k-vector, given by the determinant of the Gramian matrix .  This is then extended bilinearly (or sesquilinearly in the complex case) to a non-degenerate inner product on ΛkV.  If ei, , form an orthonormal basis of V, then the vectors of the form\n\nconstitute an orthonormal basis for Λk(V).\n\nIt is not hard to show that for vectors v1,v2,...vk \\in Rn, ‖v1∧v2∧...∧vk‖ is the volume of the parallelopiped spanned by these vectors.\n\nWith respect to the inner product, exterior multiplication and the interior product are mutually adjoint.  Specifically, for , , and ,\n\nwhere  is the linear functional defined by\n\nfor all .  This property completely characterizes the inner product on the exterior algebra.\n\nIndeed, more generally for , , and , iteration of the above adjoint properties gives\n\nwhere now  is the dual l-vector defined by\n\nfor all .\n\nFunctoriality\nSuppose that V and W are a pair of vector spaces and  is a linear transformation. Then, by the universal construction, there exists a unique homomorphism of graded algebras\n\nsuch that\n\nIn particular, Λ(f) preserves homogeneous degree. The k-graded components of Λ(f) are given on decomposable elements by\n\nLet\n\nThe components of the transformation Λ(f) relative to a basis of V and W is the matrix of  minors of f. In particular, if  and V is of finite dimension n, then Λn(f) is a mapping of a one-dimensional vector space ΛnV to itself, and is therefore given by a scalar: the determinant of f.\n\nExactness\nIf\n\nis a short exact sequence of vector spaces, then\n\nis an exact sequence of graded vector spacesThis part of the statement also holds in greater generality if V and W are modules over a commutative ring: That Λ converts epimorphisms to epimorphisms. See . as is\nThis statement generalizes only to the case where V and W are projective modules over a commutative ring. Otherwise, it is generally not the case that Λ converts monomorphisms to monomorphisms. See .\n\n Direct sums \nIn particular, the exterior algebra of a direct sum is isomorphic to the tensor product of the exterior algebras:\n\nThis is a graded isomorphism; i.e.,\n\nSlightly more generally, if\n\nis a short exact sequence of vector spaces then Λk(V) has a filtration\n\nwith quotients :. In particular, if U is 1-dimensional then\n\nis exact, and if W is 1-dimensional then\n\nis exact.Such a filtration also holds for vector bundles, and projective modules over a commutative ring. This is thus more general than the result quoted above for direct sums, since not every short exact sequence splits in other abelian categories.\n\nAlternating tensor algebra\nIf K is a field of characteristic 0,See  for generalizations. then the exterior algebra of a vector space V can be canonically identified with the vector subspace of T(V) consisting of antisymmetric tensors. Recall that the exterior algebra is the quotient of T(V) by the ideal I generated by .\n\nLet Tr(V) be the space of homogeneous tensors of degree r. This is spanned by decomposable tensors\n\nThe antisymmetrization (or sometimes the skew-symmetrization) of a decomposable tensor is defined by\n\nwhere the sum is taken over the symmetric group of permutations on the symbols  This extends by linearity and homogeneity to an operation, also denoted by Alt, on the full tensor algebra T(V). The image Alt(T(V)) is the alternating tensor algebra, denoted A(V). This is a vector subspace of T(V), and it inherits the structure of a graded vector space from that on T(V). It carries an associative graded product  defined by\n\nAlthough this product differs from the tensor product, the kernel of Alt is precisely the ideal I (again, assuming that K has characteristic 0), and there is a canonical isomorphism\n\nIndex notation\nSuppose that V has finite dimension n, and that a basis  of V is given. then any alternating tensor  can be written in index notation as\n\nwhere ti1⋅⋅⋅ir is completely antisymmetric in its indices.\n\nThe exterior product of two alternating tensors t and s of ranks r and p is given by\n\nThe components of this tensor are precisely the skew part of the components of the tensor product , denoted by square brackets on the indices:\n\nThe interior product may also be described in index notation as follows. Let  be an antisymmetric tensor of rank r. Then, for , iαt is an alternating tensor of rank , given by\n\nwhere n is the dimension of V.\n\nApplications\n\nLinear algebra\nIn applications to linear algebra, the exterior product provides an abstract algebraic manner for describing the determinant and the minors of a matrix.  For instance, it is well known that the magnitude of the determinant of a square matrix is equal to the volume of the parallelotope whose sides are the columns of the matrix.  This suggests that the determinant can be defined in terms of the exterior product of the column vectors.  Likewise, the  minors of a matrix can be defined by looking at the exterior products of column vectors chosen k at a time.  These ideas can be extended not just to matrices but to linear transformations as well: the magnitude of the determinant of a linear transformation is the factor by which it scales the volume of any given reference parallelotope.  So the determinant of a linear transformation can be defined in terms of what the transformation does to the top exterior power.  The action of a transformation on the lesser exterior powers gives a basis-independent way to talk about the minors of the transformation.\n\nTechnical details: Definitions\nLetS.Winitzki, Lineaer Algebra via Exterior Products, https://sites.google.com/site/winitzki/linalg  be an n-dimensional vector space over field  with basis . \n For , define  on simple tensors by\n\n \n\nand expand the definition linearly to all tensors. More generally, we can define  on simple tensors by\n\n \n\ni.e. choose k components on which A would act, then sum up all results obtained from different choices. If , define .

For example, if the motion of a charged particle is described by velocity and acceleration vectors in four-dimensional spacetime, then normalization of the velocity vector requires that the electromagnetic force must be an alternating operator on the velocity. Its six degrees of freedom are identified with the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nLinear geometry\nThe decomposable k-vectors have geometric interpretations: the bivector  represents the plane spanned by the vectors, \"weighted\" with a number, given by the area of the oriented parallelogram with sides u and v. Analogously, the 3-vector  represents the spanned 3-space weighted by the volume of the oriented parallelepiped with edges u, v, and w.\n\nProjective geometry\nDecomposable k-vectors in ΛkV correspond to weighted k-dimensional linear subspaces of V. In particular, the Grassmannian of k-dimensional subspaces of V, denoted Grk(V), can be naturally identified with an algebraic subvariety of the projective space P(ΛkV). This is called the Plücker embedding.\n\nDifferential geometry\nThe exterior algebra has notable applications in differential geometry, where it is used to define differential forms. A differential form at a point of a differentiable manifold is an alternating multilinear form on the tangent space at the point. Equivalently, a differential form of degree k is a linear functional on the k-th exterior power of the tangent space. As a consequence, the exterior product of multilinear forms defines a natural exterior product for differential forms. Differential forms play a major role in diverse areas of differential geometry.\n\nIn particular, the exterior derivative gives the exterior algebra of differential forms on a manifold the structure of a differential algebra. The exterior derivative commutes with pullback along smooth mappings between manifolds, and it is therefore a natural differential operator. The exterior algebra of differential forms, equipped with the exterior derivative, is a cochain complex whose cohomology is called the de Rham cohomology of the underlying manifold and plays a vital role in the algebraic topology of differentiable manifolds.\n\nRepresentation theory\nIn representation theory, the exterior algebra is one of the two fundamental Schur functors on the category of vector spaces, the other being the symmetric algebra. Together, these constructions are used to generate the irreducible representations of the general linear group; see fundamental representation.\n\nSuperspace\nThe exterior algebra over the complex numbers is the archetypal example of a superalgebra, which plays a fundamental role in physical theories pertaining to fermions and supersymmetry. A single element of the exterior algebra is called a supernumberBryce DeWitt, Supermanifolds, (1984) Cambridge University Press . (See Chapter 1, page 1.) or Grassmann number. The exterior algebra itself is then just a one-dimensional superspace: it is just the set of all of the points in the exterior algebra. The topology on this space is essentially the weak topology, the open sets being the cylinder sets.  An -dimensional superspace is just the -fold product of exterior algebras.\n\nLie algebra homology\nLet L be a Lie algebra over a field K, then it is possible to define the structure of a chain complex on the exterior algebra of L. This is a K-linear mapping\n\ndefined on decomposable elements by\n\nThe Jacobi identity holds if and only if , and so this is a necessary and sufficient condition for an anticommutative nonassociative algebra L to be a Lie algebra.  Moreover, in that case ΛL is a chain complex with boundary operator ∂.  The homology associated to this complex is the Lie algebra homology.\n\nHomological algebra\nThe exterior algebra is the main ingredient in the construction of the Koszul complex, a fundamental object in homological algebra.\n\n History \nThe exterior algebra was first introduced by Hermann Grassmann in 1844 under the blanket term of Ausdehnungslehre, or Theory of Extension. published a translation of Grassmann's work in English; he translated Ausdehnungslehre as Extension Theory.\nThis referred more generally to an algebraic (or axiomatic) theory of extended quantities and was one of the early precursors to the modern notion of a vector space. Saint-Venant also published similar ideas of exterior calculus for which he claimed priority over Grassmann.J Itard, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York 1970–1990).\n\nThe algebra itself was built from a set of rules, or axioms, capturing the formal aspects of Cayley and Sylvester's theory of multivectors. It was thus a calculus, much like the propositional calculus, except focused exclusively on the task of formal reasoning in geometrical terms.Authors have in the past referred to this calculus variously as the calculus of extension (; ), or extensive algebra , and recently as extended vector algebra .\nIn particular, this new development allowed for an axiomatic characterization of dimension, a property that had previously only been examined from the coordinate point of view.\n\nThe import of this new theory of vectors and multivectors was lost to mid 19th century mathematicians,.\nuntil being thoroughly vetted by Giuseppe Peano in 1888. Peano's work also remained somewhat obscure until the turn of the century, when the subject was unified by members of the French geometry school (notably Henri Poincaré, Élie Cartan, and Gaston Darboux) who applied Grassmann's ideas to the calculus of differential forms.\n\nA short while later, Alfred North Whitehead, borrowing from the ideas of Peano and Grassmann, introduced his universal algebra. This then paved the way for the 20th century developments of abstract algebra by placing the axiomatic notion of an algebraic system on a firm logical footing.\n\nSee also\n\nSymmetric algebra, the symmetric analog\nClifford algebra, a quantum deformation of the exterior algebra by a quadratic form\nWeyl algebra, a quantum deformation of the symmetric algebra by a symplectic form\nMultilinear algebra\nTensor algebra\nGeometric algebra\nKoszul complex\nWedge sum\n\n Notes \n\n References \n\nMathematical references\n \n Includes a treatment of alternating tensors and alternating forms, as well as a detailed discussion of Hodge duality from the perspective adopted in this article.\n \n This is the main mathematical reference for the article.

      "text": "The Blessed Francesco Faà di Bruno (29 March 1825 – 27 March 1888) was an Italian priest and advocate of the poor, a leading mathematician of his era and a noted religious musician. In 1988 he was beatified by Pope John Paul II.See the Vatican News Service, \"Papal Office for Liturgical Celebrations\" . He is the eponym of Faà di Bruno's formula.\n\nLife\n\nEarly life\nFaà di Bruno was born in Alessandria, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, on 29 March 1825. He was of noble birth, being the twelfth and youngest child of the Marchese Luigi Faà di Bruno and the Lady Carolina Sappa de' Milanesi. He was raised in a home marked by happiness, the arts and a concern for the poor arising from the parents' strong Catholic faith.See .\n\nAs a young man, he entered the Royal Army and held, at one time, the rank of Staff Officer. He resigned his commission, and went to Paris, where he did doctoral studies in mathematics under Augustin Cauchy, and Urbain Le Verrier, who both shared in the discovery of the planet Neptune.. He was in close contact with the mathematicians François-Napoléon-Marie Moigno and Charles Hermite.\n\nOn his return to Turin, he took up the position of Professor of Mathematics at the local university. In recognition of his achievements as a mathematician, the degree of Doctor of Science was conferred on him by the Universities of Paris and Turin.\n\nSocial reformer\nWhile carrying out his career responsibilities, Faà di Bruno also became actively involved in the social outreach to the poor being developed by leading figures of the Catholic Church in Turin. He became a close friend of St. John Bosco,See  and helped establish refuges for the elderly and the poor. He oversaw the construction of a church in Turin, Our Lady of Suffrage.Pope John Paul II, Message to the Institute of the Minim Sisters of Our Lady of Suffrage, September 2, 2002\n\nPriest and founder\nSomewhat late in his life, Faà di Bruno came to feel that pursuing Holy Orders would help him in his religious activities, and commenced the necessary studies in theology. What he found, however, was that the Archbishop of Turin at that time would not accept an older man for ordination, Faà di Bruno being in his late 40s at that time. For centuries, the traditional route for this profession began in a boy's mid-teens.\n\nFaà di Bruno appealed to Pope Pius IX and received his support, finally being ordained at age 51. He founded the Minim Sisters of St. Zita in 1881 to provide help for maids and domestic servants, later expanding its outreach to include others, such as unmarried mothers. With their help, he also established another refuge, one dedicated to taking in prostitutes.\n\nFaà di Bruno died in Turin on 27 March 1888.\n\nVeneration\nThe cause for the canonization of Faà di Bruno opened in the early 20th century by the Archdiocese of Turin and he was declared a Servant of God. He was declared Venerable by Pope Paul VI in 1971, and beatified by Pope John Paul II on the centennial of his death in 1988.\n\nIn an address to the Minim Sisters in 2002, Pope John Paul II said, \"\"Francesco Faà di Bruno\", I said, is \"a giant of faith and charity\", for his message of light and love, \"far from being exhausted, seems timelier than ever, urging all those who have Gospel values at heart to action\"\" (Homily, 25 September, n. 4; ORE, 24 October 1988, p. 15).\n\nResearch in mathematics\nIn addition to some ascetical writings, the composition of some sacred melodies, and the invention of some scientific apparatus, Faà di Bruno made numerous and important contributions to mathematics.  Today, he is best known for Faà di Bruno's formula on derivatives of composite functions, although it is now certain that the priority in its discovery and use is of Louis François Antoine Arbogast: Faà di Bruno should be only credited for the determinant form of this formula.See the paper of : this well written and informative paper details also the works of other earlier scientists. However, his work is mainly related to elimination theory and to the theory of elliptic functions.See  and various papers in the volume edited by : particularly in this later reference it is stated that he introduced the Faà di Bruno's formula in order to deal with problems in elimination theory.\n\nHe was the author of about 40 original articles published in the \"Journal de Mathématiques\" (edited by Joseph Liouville), Crelle's Journal, \"American Journal of Mathematics\" (Johns Hopkins University), \"Annali di Tortolini\", \"Les Mondes\", \"Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences\", etc.; the first half of an exhaustive treatise on the theory and applications of elliptic functions which he planned to complete in three volumes; \"Théorie générale de l'élimination\" (Paris, 1859); \"Calcolo degli errori\" (Turin, 1867), translated into French under the title of \"Traité élémentaire du calcul des erreurs\" (Paris, 1869); and most important of all, \"Théorie des formes binaires\" (Paris, 1876), translated into German (Leipzig, 1881).

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frege%27s_theorem",
      "text": "In metalogic and metamathematics, Frege's theorem is a metatheorem that states that the Peano axioms of arithmetic can be derived in second-order logic from Hume's principle. It was first proven, informally, by Gottlob Frege in his Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik (The Foundations of Arithmetic), published in 1884, and proven more formally in his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic), published in two volumes, in 1893 and 1903. The theorem was re-discovered by Crispin Wright in the early 1980s and has since been the focus of significant work. It is at the core of the philosophy of mathematics known as neo-logicism (at least of the Scottish School variety).\n\n Overview \nIn The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884), and later, in Basic Laws of Arithmetic (vol. 1, 1893; vol. 2, 1903), Frege attempted to derive all of the laws of arithmetic from axioms he asserted as logical (see logicism). Most of these axioms were carried over from his Begriffsschrift; the one truly new principle was one he called the Basic Law V (now known as the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension):Richard Pettigrew, \"Basic set theory\", January 26, 2012, p. 2. the \"value-range\" of the function f(x) is the same as the \"value-range\" of the function g(x) if and only if ∀x[f(x) = g(x)]. However, not only did Basic Law V fail to be a logical proposition, but the resulting system proved to be inconsistent, because it was subject to Russell's paradox.. The inconsistency in Frege's Grundgesetze overshadowed Frege's achievement: according to Edward Zalta, the Grundgesetze \"contains all the essential steps of a valid proof (in second-order logic) of the fundamental propositions of arithmetic from a single consistent principle.\" This achievement has become known as Frege's theorem.\n\n Frege's theorem in propositional logic \n\n( P  →     ( Q  →     R )) →     (( P →     Q) →     ( P →     R  ))                                                                                          1     2  3      4     5       6   7     8     9     10  11    12    13\n\nIn propositional logic, Frege's theorems refers to this tautology:\n\n (P → (Q→R)) → ((P→Q) →  (P→R))\n\nThe truth table to the right gives a proof. For all possible assignments of false () or true () to P, Q, and R (columns 1, 3, 5), each subformula is evaluated according to the rules for material conditional, the result being shown below its main operator. Column 6 shows that the whole formula evaluates to true in every case, i.e. that it is a tautology. In fact, its antecedent (column 2) and its consequent (column 10) are even equivalent.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n  \n  — Edition in modern notation\n  — Edition in modern notation\n\nCategory:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics\nCategory:Theorems in propositional logic\nCategory:Metatheorems"

Among other things it can be used to show that the Π02-theorems of various first-order theories of classical mathematics are also theorems of intuitionistic mathematics. It is named after its discoverer, Harvey Friedman.\n\nDefinition\nLet A and B be intuitionistic formulas, where no free variable of B is quantified in A. The translation AB is defined by replacing each atomic subformula C of A by . For purposes of the translation, ⊥ is considered to be an atomic formula as well, hence it is replaced with  (which is equivalent to B).

The key condition is that the  sentences of the logic be decidable, allowing the unquantified theorems of the intuitionistic and classical theories to coincide.\n\nFor example, if A is provable in Heyting arithmetic (HA), then AB is also provable in HA.Harvey Friedman.

      "text": "General set theory (GST) is George Boolos's (1998) name for a fragment of the axiomatic set theory Z. GST is sufficient for all mathematics not requiring infinite sets, and is the weakest known set theory whose theorems include the Peano axioms.\n\nOntology\nThe ontology of GST is identical to that of ZFC, and hence is thoroughly canonical. GST features a single primitive ontological notion, that of set, and a single ontological assumption, namely that all individuals in the universe of discourse (hence all mathematical objects) are sets. There is a single primitive binary relation, set membership; that set a is a member of set b is written a∈b (usually read \"a is an element of b\").\n\nAxioms\nThe  symbolic axioms below are from Boolos (1998: 196), and govern how sets behave and interact. The natural language versions of the axioms are intended to aid the intuition. The background logic is first order logic with identity.\n\n1) Axiom of Extensionality: The sets x and y are the same set if they have the same members.\n\nThe converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of equality.\n\n2) Axiom Schema of Specification (or Separation or Restricted Comprehension):  If z is a set and  is any property which may be satisfied by all, some, or no elements of z, then there exists a subset y of z containing just those elements x in z which satisfy the property . The restriction to z is necessary to avoid Russell's paradox and its variants. More formally, let  be any formula in the language of GST in which x may occur freely and y does not. Then all instances of the following schema are axioms:\n\n3) Axiom of Adjunction: If x and y are sets, then there exists a set w, the adjunction of x and y, whose members are just y and the members of x.Adjunction is seldom mentioned in the literature. Exceptions are Burgess (2005) passim, and QIII in Tarski and Givant (1987: 223).\n\nAdjunction refers to an elementary operation on two sets, and has no bearing on the use of that term elsewhere in mathematics, including in category theory.\n\nDiscussion\nGST is the fragment of Z obtained by omitting the axioms Union, Power Set, Elementary Sets (essentially Pairing) and Infinity, then taking Adjunction, a theorem of Z, as an axiom. The result is a first order theory.\n\nSetting φ(x) in Separation to x≠x, and assuming that the domain is nonempty, assures the existence of the empty set. Adjunction implies that if x is a set, then so is . Given Adjunction, the usual construction of the successor ordinals from the empty set can proceed, one in which the natural numbers are defined as  (see Peano's axioms). More generally, given any model M of ZFC, the collection of hereditarily finite sets in M will satisfy the GST axioms. Therefore, GST cannot prove the existence of even a countable infinite set, that is, of a set whose cardinality is ℵ0. Even if GST did afford a countably infinite set, GST could not prove the existence of a set whose cardinality is , because GST lacks the axiom of power set. Hence GST cannot ground analysis and geometry, and is too weak to serve as a foundation for mathematics.\n\nBoolos was interested in GST only as a fragment of Z that is just powerful enough to interpret Peano arithmetic. He never lingered over GST, only mentioning it briefly in several papers discussing the systems of Frege's Grundlagen and Grundgesetze, and how they could be modified to eliminate Russell's paradox. The system Aξ'[δ0] in Tarski and Givant (1987: 223) is essentially GST with an axiom schema of induction replacing Specification, and with the existence of an empty set explicitly assumed.\n\nGST is called STZ in Burgess (2005), p. 223.The Empty Set axiom in STZ is redundant, because the existence of the empty set is derivable from the axiom schema of Specification. Burgess's theory STCalled S' in Tarski et al. (1953: 34). is GST with Empty Set replacing the axiom schema of specification. That the letters \"ST\" also appear in \"GST\" is a coincidence.\n\nMetamathematics\nThe most remarkable fact about ST (and hence GST), is that these tiny fragments of set theory give rise to such rich metamathematics. While ST is a small fragment of the well-known canonical set theories ZFC and NBG, ST interprets Robinson arithmetic (Q), so that ST inherits the nontrivial metamathematics of Q. For example, ST is essentially undecidable because Q is, and every consistent theory whose theorems include the ST axioms is also essentially undecidable.Burgess (2005), 2.2, p. 91. This includes GST and every axiomatic set theory worth thinking about, assuming these are consistent. In fact, the undecidability of ST implies the undecidability of first-order logic with a single binary predicate letter.Tarski et al. (1953), p. 34.\n\nQ is also incomplete in the sense of Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Any axiomatizable theory, such as ST and GST, whose theorems include the Q axioms is likewise incomplete. Moreover, the consistency of GST cannot be proved within GST itself, unless GST is in fact inconsistent.\n\nGST is:\nMutually interpretable with Peano arithmetic (thus it has the same proof-theoretic strength as PA);\nImmune to the three great antinomies of naïve set theory: Russell's, Burali-Forti's, and Cantor's;\nNot finitely axiomatizable. Montague (1961) showed that ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable, and his argument carries over to GST. Hence any axiomatization of GST must either include at least one axiom schema such as Separation;\nInterpretable in relation algebra because no part of any GST axiom lies in the scope of more than three quantifiers. This is the necessary and sufficient condition given in Tarski and Givant (1987).\n\n Footnotes \n\nReferences\nGeorge Boolos (1999) Logic, Logic, and Logic. Harvard Univ.

      "text": "George Stephen Boolos (;\"Can you solve the three gods riddle? - Alex Gendler\" September 4, 1940 – May 27, 1996) was an American philosopher and a mathematical logician who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n Life \nBoolos graduated from Princeton University in 1961 with an A.B. in mathematics. Oxford University awarded him the B.Phil. in 1963. In 1966, he obtained the first Ph.D. in philosophy ever awarded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under the direction of Hilary Putnam. After teaching three years at Columbia University, he returned to MIT in 1969, where he spent the rest of his career until his death from cancer.MIT faculty resolution on Boolos' death\n\nA charismatic speaker well known for his clarity and wit, he once delivered a lecture (1994b) giving an account of Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, employing only words of one syllable. At the end of his viva, Hilary Putnam asked him, \"And tell us, Mr. Boolos, what does the analytical hierarchy have to do with the real world?\" Without hesitating Boolos replied, \"It's part of it\".\n\nAn expert on puzzles of all kinds, in 1993 Boolos reached the London Regional Final of The Times crossword competition. His score was one of the highest ever recorded by an American. He wrote a paper on \"The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever\"—one of many puzzles created by Raymond Smullyan.\n\n Work \nBoolos coauthored with Richard Jeffrey the first three editions of the classic university text on mathematical logic, Computability and Logic. The book is now in its fifth edition, the last two editions updated by John P. Burgess.\n\nKurt Gödel wrote the first paper on provability logic, which applies modal logic—the logic of necessity and possibility—to the theory of mathematical proof, but Gödel never developed the subject to any significant extent. Boolos was one of its earliest proponents and pioneers, and he produced the first book-length treatment of it, The Unprovability of Consistency, published in 1979. The solution of a major unsolved problem some years later led to a new treatment, The Logic of Provability, published in 1993. The modal-logical treatment of provability helped demonstrate the \"intensionality\" of Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem, meaning that the theorem's correctness depends on the precise formulation of the provability predicate. These conditions were first identified by David Hilbert and Paul Bernays in their Grundlagen der Arithmetik. The unclear status of the Second Theorem was noted for several decades by logicians such as Georg Kreisel and Leon Henkin, who asked whether the formal sentence expressing \"This sentence is provable\" (as opposed to the Gödel sentence, \"This sentence is not provable\") was provable and hence true. Martin Löb showed Henkin's conjecture to be true, as well as identifying an important \"reflection\" principle also neatly codified using the modal logical approach. Some of the key provability results involving the representation of provability predicates had been obtained earlier using very different methods by Solomon Feferman.\n\nBoolos was an authority on the 19th-century German mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege. Boolos proved a conjecture due to Crispin Wright (and also proved, independently, by others), that the system of Frege's Grundgesetze, long thought vitiated by Russell's paradox, could be freed of inconsistency by replacing one of its axioms, the notorious Basic Law V with Hume's Principle. The resulting system has since been the subject of intense work.\n\nBoolos argued that if one reads the second-order variables in monadic second-order logic plurally, then second-order logic can be interpreted as having no ontological commitment to entities other than those over which the first-order variables range. The result is plural quantification. David Lewis employed plural quantification in his Parts of Classes to derive a system in which Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and the Peano axioms were all theorems. While Boolos is usually credited with plural quantification, Peter Simons (1982) has argued that the essential idea can be found in the work of Stanislaw Leśniewski.\n\nShortly before his death, Boolos chose 30 of his papers to be published in a book. The result is perhaps his most highly regarded work, his posthumous Logic, Logic, and Logic. This book reprints much of Boolos's work on the rehabilitation of Frege, as well as a number of his papers on set theory, second-order logic and nonfirstorderizability, plural quantification, proof theory, and three short insightful papers on Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem.

      "text": "Gerhard Karl Erich Gentzen (November 24, 1909 – August 4, 1945) was a German mathematician and logician. He made major contributions to the foundations of mathematics, proof theory, especially on natural deduction and sequent calculus. He died in 1945 after the Second World War from food deprivation after being arrested in Prague.\n\nLife and career\nGentzen was a student of Paul Bernays at the University of Göttingen. Bernays was fired as \"non-Aryan\" in April 1933 and therefore Hermann Weyl formally acted as his supervisor. Gentzen joined the Sturmabteilung in November 1933 although he was by no means compelled to do so.Menzler-Trott, p. 52. Nevertheless he kept in contact with Bernays until the beginning of the Second World War. In 1935, he corresponded with Abraham Fraenkel in Jerusalem and was implicated by the Nazi teachers' union as one who \"keeps contacts to the Chosen People.\" In 1935 and 1936, Hermann Weyl, head of the Göttingen mathematics department in 1933 until his resignation under Nazi pressure, made strong efforts to bring him to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.\n\nBetween November 1935 and 1939 he was an assistant of David Hilbert in Göttingen. Gentzen joined the Nazi Party in 1937. In April 1939 Gentzen swore the oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler as part of his academic appointment.Menzler-Trott, p. 119. From 1943 he was a teacher at the University of Prague.Gerhard Gentzen at math.muni.cz Under a contract from the SS Gentzen evidently worked for the V-2 project.Menzler-Trott, p. 238.\n\nGentzen was arrested during the citizens uprising against the occupying German forces on May 5, 1945. He, along with the rest of the staff of the German University in Prague was subsequently handed over to Russian forces. Because of his past association with the SA, NSDAP and NSD Dozentenbund, Gentzen was detained in a prison camp, where he died of malnutrition on August 4, 1945.Menzler-Trott, p. 273 ff.http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Gentzen.html\n\nWork\n\nGentzen's main work was on the foundations of mathematics, in proof theory, specifically natural deduction and the sequent calculus. His cut-elimination theorem is the cornerstone of proof-theoretic semantics, and some philosophical remarks in his \"Investigations into Logical Deduction\", together with Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work, constitute the starting point for inferential role semantics.\n\nOne of Gentzen's papers had a second publication in the ideological Deutsche Mathematik that was founded by Ludwig Bieberbach who promoted \"Aryan\" mathematics.Dipl.Math. Walter Tydecks, Neuere Geschichte der Mathematik in Deutschland (in German)\n\nGentzen proved the consistency of the Peano axioms in a paper published in 1936. In his Habilitationsschrift, finished in 1939, he determined the proof-theoretical strength of Peano arithmetic. This was done by a direct proof of the unprovability of the principle of transfinite induction, used in his 1936 proof of consistency, within Peano arithmetic. The principle can, however, be expressed in arithmetic, so that a direct proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorem followed. Gödel used a coding procedure to construct an unprovable formula of arithmetic. Gentzen's proof was published in 1943 and marked the beginning of ordinal proof theory.\n\nPublications\n \n \n \n \n \n  (Lecture hold in Münster at the institute of Heinrich Scholz on 27 June 1936)\n \n \n \n \n\nPosthumous\n \n  – Published by Paul Bernays.\n  – Published by Paul Bernays.\n\nSee also\n\nBertrand Russell\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n - (English translation).\n\n - an English translation.\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nCategory:1909 births\nCategory:1945 deaths\nCategory:People from Greifswald\nCategory:University of Göttingen alumni\nCategory:Charles University in Prague faculty\nCategory:20th-century German mathematicians\nCategory:German logicians\nCategory:People from the Province of Pomerania\nCategory:German philosophers"

      "title": "Gödel numbering",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering",
      "text": "In mathematical logic, a Gödel numbering is a function that assigns to each symbol and well-formed formula of some formal language a unique natural number, called its Gödel number. The concept was used by Kurt Gödel for the proof of his incompleteness theorems. ()\n\nA Gödel numbering can be interpreted as an encoding in which a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation, after which a sequence of natural numbers can then represent a sequence of symbols. These sequences of natural numbers can again be represented by single natural numbers, facilitating their manipulation in formal theories of arithmetic.\n\nSince the publishing of Gödel's paper in 1931, the term \"Gödel numbering\" or \"Gödel code\" has been used to refer to more general assignments of natural numbers to mathematical objects.\n\n Simplified overview \nGödel noted that statements within a system can be represented by natural numbers. The significance of this was that properties of statements - such as their truth and falsehood - would be equivalent to determining whether their Gödel numbers had certain properties. The numbers involved might be very long indeed (in terms of number of digits), but this is not a barrier; all that matters is that we can show such numbers can be constructed.\n\nIn simple terms, we devise a method by which every formula or statement that can be formulated in our system gets a unique number, in such a way that we can mechanically convert back and forth between formulas and Gödel numbers. Clearly there are many ways this can be done. Given any statement, the number it is converted to is known as its Gödel number. A simple example is the way in which English is stored as a sequence of numbers in computers using ASCII or Unicode:\n The word HELLO is represented by 72-69-76-76-79 using decimal ASCII.\n The logical statement x=y => y=x is represented by 120-61-121-32-61-62-32-121-61-120 using decimal ASCII.\n\n Gödel's encoding \n number variables property variables ... Symbol 0 s ¬ ∨ ∀ ( ) x1 x2 x3 ... P1 P2 P3 ... Number 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 17 19 23 ... 289 361 529 ...+ Gödel's original encodingSee Gödel 1931, p.179; Gödel's notation (see p.176) has been adapted to modern notation.\nGödel used a system based on prime factorization. He first assigned a unique natural number to each basic symbol in the formal language of arithmetic with which he was dealing.\n\nTo encode an entire formula, which is a sequence of symbols, Gödel used the following system. Given a sequence  of positive integers, the Gödel encoding of the sequence is the product of the first n primes raised to their corresponding values in the sequence:\n\nAccording to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, any number (and, in particular, a number obtained in this way) can be uniquely factored into prime factors, so it is possible to recover the original sequence from its Gödel number (for any given number n of symbols to be encoded).\n\nGödel specifically used this scheme at two levels: first, to encode sequences of symbols representing formulas, and second, to encode sequences of formulas representing proofs. This allowed him to show a correspondence between statements about natural numbers and statements about the provability of theorems about natural numbers, the key observation of the proof.\n\nThere are more sophisticated (and more concise) ways to construct a Gödel numbering for sequences.\n\n Example \n\nIn the specific Gödel numbering used by  Nagel and Newman, the Gödel number for the symbol \"0\" is 6 and the Gödel number for the symbol \"=\" is 5. Thus, in their system, the Gödel number of the formula \"0 = 0\" is 26 × 35 × 56 = 243,000,000.\n\n Lack of uniqueness \n\nA Gödel numbering is not unique, in that for any proof using Gödel numbers, there are infinitely many ways in which these numbers could be defined.\n\nFor example, supposing there are K basic symbols, an alternative Gödel numbering could be constructed by invertibly mapping this set of symbols (through, say, an invertible function h) to the set of digits of a bijective base-K numeral system. A formula consisting of a string of n symbols  would then be mapped to the number\n\nIn other words, by placing the set of K basic symbols in some fixed order, such that the ith symbol corresponds uniquely to the ith digit of a bijective base-K numeral system, each formula may serve just as the very numeral of its own Gödel number.\n\nFor example, the numbering described here has K=10000.\n\n Application to formal arithmetic \n\nRecursion\n\nOne may use Gödel numbering to show how functions defined by course-of-values recursion are in fact primitive recursive functions.\n\nExpressing statements and proofs by numbers\n\nOnce a Gödel numbering for a formal theory is established, each inference rule of the theory can be expressed as a function on the natural numbers. If f is the Gödel mapping and r is an inference rule, then there should be some arithmetical function gr of natural numbers such that if formula C is derived from formulas A and B through an inference rule r, i.e.\n\nthen\n\nThis is true for the numbering Gödel used, and for any other numbering where the encoded formula can be arithmetically recovered from its Gödel number.\n\nThus, in a formal theory such as Peano arithmetic in which one can make statements about numbers and their arithmetical relationships to each other, one can use a Gödel numbering to indirectly make statements about the theory itself. This technique allowed Gödel to prove results about the consistency and completeness properties of formal systems.\n\n Generalizations \n\nIn computability theory, the term \"Gödel numbering\" is used in settings more general than the one described above. It can refer to:\nAny assignment of the elements of a formal language to natural numbers in such a way that the numbers can be manipulated by an algorithm to simulate manipulation of elements of the formal language.\nMore generally, an assignment of elements from a countable mathematical object, such as a countable group, to natural numbers to allow algorithmic manipulation of the mathematical object.\n\nAlso, the term Gödel numbering is sometimes used when the assigned \"numbers\" are actually strings, which is necessary when considering models of computation such as Turing machines that manipulate strings rather than numbers. \n\nGödel  sets\nGödel  sets are sometimes used in set theory to encode formulas, and are similar to Gödel  numbers, except that one uses sets rather than numbers to do the encoding. In simple cases when one uses a hereditarily finite set to encode formulas this is essentially equivalent to the use of Gödel numbers, but somewhat easier to define because the tree structure of formulas can be modeled by the tree structure of sets.  Gödel  sets can also be used to encode formulas in infinitary languages.\n\n See also \n Church encoding\n Description number\n Gödel numbering for sequences\n Gödel's incompleteness theorems\n Chaitin's incompleteness theorem\n\n References \n\n .\nGödel's Proof by Ernest Nagel and James R.

      "text": "Jules Henri Poincaré (;\"Poincaré\". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 29 April 1854 – 17 July 1912) was a French mathematician, theoretical physicist, engineer, and philosopher of science. He is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as \"The Last Universalist,\" since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime.\n\nAs a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics. He was responsible for formulating the Poincaré conjecture, which was one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics until it was solved in 2002–2003 by Grigori Perelman. In his research on the three-body problem, Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology.\n\nPoincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations.\n\nThe Poincaré group used in physics and mathematics was named after him.\n\nLife\nPoincaré was born on 29 April 1854 in Cité Ducale neighborhood, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle into an influential family.Belliver, 1956 His father Leon Poincaré (1828–1892) was a professor of medicine at the University of Nancy.Sagaret, 1911 His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher Emile Boutroux. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, Raymond Poincaré, a fellow member of the Académie française, who would serve as President of France from 1913 to 1920.The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Jules Henri Poincaré article by Mauro Murzi – Retrieved November 2006. \n\nEducation\nthumb|right|200px| Plaque on the birthplace of Henri Poincaré at house number 117 on the Grande Rue in the city of Nancy.\n\nDuring his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with diphtheria and received special instruction from his mother, Eugénie Launois (1830–1897).\n\nIn 1862, Henri entered the Lycée in Nancy (now renamed the  in his honour, along with Henri Poincaré University, also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lycée and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a \"monster of mathematics\" and he won first prizes in the concours général, a competition between the top pupils from all the Lycées across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as \"average at best\".O'Connor et al., 2002 However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.Carl, 1968 He graduated from the Lycée in 1871 with a bachelor's degree in letters and sciences.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.\n\nPoincaré entered the École Polytechnique in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of Charles Hermite, continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (Démonstration nouvelle des propriétés de l'indicatrice d'une surface) in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the École des Mines, while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.F. Verhulst\n\nAs a graduate of the École des Mines, he joined the Corps des Mines as an inspector for the Vesoul region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at Magny in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way.\n\nAt the same time, Poincaré was preparing for his Doctorate in Science in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of differential equations. It was named Sur les propriétés des fonctions définies par les équations aux différences partielles. Poincaré devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the solar system. Poincaré graduated from the University of Paris in 1879.\n\nleft|upright|thumb|The young Henri Poincaré\n\nFirst scientific achievements\nAfter receiving his degree, Poincaré began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Caen in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of automorphic functions.\n\nThere, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulin d'Andesi (Louise Poulain d'Andecy) and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and Léon (born 1893).\n\nPoincaré immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincaré was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris; he accepted the invitation. During the years of 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in École Polytechnique.\n\nIn 1881–1882, Poincaré created a new branch of mathematics: qualitative theory of differential equations. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in celestial mechanics and mathematical physics.\n\nCareer\nHe never fully abandoned his mining career to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps de Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.\n\nBeginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). He was initially appointed as the maître de conférences d'analyse (associate professor of analysis).Sageret, 1911 Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of ProbabilityLaurent Mazliak. « Poincaré’s Odds ».

Basel : Birkhäuser, and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.\n\nIn 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincaré was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the Académie française on 5 March 1908.\n\nIn 1887, he won Oscar II, King of Sweden's mathematical competition for a resolution of the three-body problem concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See three-body problem section below.)\n\nupright|thumb|The Poincaré family grave at the Cimetière du Montparnasse\nIn 1893, Poincaré joined the French Bureau des Longitudes, which engaged him in the synchronisation of time around the world. In 1897 Poincaré backed an unsuccessful proposal for the decimalisation of circular measure, and hence time and longitude.see Galison 2003 It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See work on relativity section below.)\n\nIn 1899, and again more successfully in 1904, he intervened in the trials of Alfred Dreyfus. He attacked the spurious scientific claims of some of the evidence brought against Dreyfus, who was a Jewish officer in the French army charged with treason by colleagues.\n\nPoincaré was the President of the Société Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1901 to 1903.Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France, 1911, vol. 25, pp. 581–586\n\nStudents\nPoincaré had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, Louis Bachelier (1900) and Dimitrie Pompeiu (1905).Mathematics Genealogy Project North Dakota State University. Retrieved April 2008.\n\n Death \n\nIn 1912, Poincaré underwent surgery for a prostate problem and subsequently died from an embolism on 17 July 1912, in Paris. He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincaré family vault in the Cemetery of Montparnasse, Paris.\n\nA former French Minister of Education, Claude Allègre, proposed in 2004 that Poincaré be reburied in the Panthéon in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens only of the highest honour.Lorentz, Poincaré et Einstein\n\nWork\n\nSummary\nPoincaré made many contributions to different fields of pure and applied mathematics such as: celestial mechanics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity, telegraphy, capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, potential theory, quantum theory, theory of relativity and physical cosmology.\n\nHe was also a populariser of mathematics and physics and wrote several books for the lay public.\n\nAmong the specific topics he contributed to are the following:\nalgebraic topology\nthe theory of analytic functions of several complex variables\nthe theory of abelian functions\nalgebraic geometry\nPoincaré was responsible for formulating one of the most famous problems in mathematics, the Poincaré conjecture, proven in 2003 by Grigori Perelman.\nPoincaré recurrence theorem\nhyperbolic geometry\nnumber theory\nthe three-body problem\nthe theory of diophantine equations\nthe theory of electromagnetism\nthe special theory of relativity\nIn an 1894 paper, he introduced the concept of the fundamental group.\nIn the field of differential equations Poincaré has given many results that are critical for the qualitative theory of differential equations, for example the Poincaré sphere and the Poincaré map.\nPoincaré on \"everybody's belief\" in the Normal Law of Errors (see normal distribution for an account of that \"law\")\nPublished an influential paper providing a novel mathematical argument in support of quantum mechanics.\n\nThree-body problem\nThe problem of finding the general solution to the motion of more than two orbiting bodies in the solar system had eluded mathematicians since Newton's time. This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the n-body problem, where n is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The n-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, Oscar II, King of Sweden, advised by Gösta Mittag-Leffler, established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:\n\nGiven a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each according to Newton's law, under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series converges uniformly.\n\nIn case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincaré, even though he did not solve the original problem. One of the judges, the distinguished Karl Weierstrass, said, \"This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics.\" (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu and the book by Barrow-Green). The version finally printed contained many important ideas which led to the theory of chaos. The problem as stated originally was finally solved by Karl F. Sundman for n = 3 in 1912 and was generalised to the case of n > 3 bodies by Qiudong Wang in the 1990s.\n\nWork on relativity\nthumb|right|Marie Curie and Poincaré talk at the 1911 Solvay Conference\n\nLocal time\nPoincaré's work at the Bureau des Longitudes on establishing international time zones led him to consider how clocks at rest on the Earth, which would be moving at different speeds relative to absolute space (or the \"luminiferous aether\"), could be synchronised. At the same time Dutch theorist Hendrik Lorentz was developing Maxwell's theory into a theory of the motion of charged particles (\"electrons\" or \"ions\"), and their interaction with radiation. In 1895 Lorentz had introduced an auxiliary quantity (without physical interpretation) called \"local time\"  , Section A5a, p 37\nand introduced the hypothesis of length contraction to explain the failure of optical and electrical experiments to detect motion relative to the aether (see Michelson–Morley experiment).\nPoincaré was a constant interpreter (and sometimes friendly critic) of Lorentz's theory. Poincaré as a philosopher was interested in the \"deeper meaning\". Thus he interpreted Lorentz's theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In The Measure of Time (1898), Poincaré said, \"\nA little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning. They can have one only as the result of a convention.\" He also argued that scientists have to set the constancy of the speed of light as a postulate to give physical theories the simplest form.\nBased on these assumptions he discussed in 1900 Lorentz's \"wonderful invention\" of local time and remarked that it arose when moving clocks are synchronised by exchanging light signals assumed to travel with the same speed in both directions in a moving frame.. See also the English translation\n\nPrinciple of relativity and Lorentz transformations\n\nIn 1881 Poincaré described hyperbolic geometry in terms of Weierstrass coordinates of the hyperboloid model. There, he formulated transformations leaving invariant the Lorentz interval , which makes them mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz transformations in 2+1 dimensions.\n\nPoincare developed a mathematical theory of light including polarization. His vision of  the action of polarizers and retarders, acting on a sphere representing polarized states, is called the Poincaré sphere.H. Poincare (1889) Theorie Mathematique de la Lumiere, volume 1 and Volume 2 (1892) via Internet Archive.H. Poincare (1901) Electricite et Optique : La Lumiere et les Theories Electrodynamique, via Internet Archive\n\nHe discussed the \"principle of relative motion\" in two papers in 1900. Reprinted in \"Science and Hypothesis\", Ch. 9–10.\nand named it the principle of relativity in 1904, according to which no physical experiment can discriminate between a state of uniform motion and a state of rest. available in online chapter from 1913 book\nIn 1905 Poincaré wrote to Lorentz about Lorentz's paper of 1904, which Poincaré described as a \"paper of supreme importance.\" In this letter he pointed out an error Lorentz had made when he had applied his transformation to one of Maxwell's equations, that for charge-occupied space, and also questioned the time dilation factor given by Lorentz.\nIn a second letter to Lorentz, Poincaré gave his own reason why Lorentz's time dilation factor was indeed correct after all—it was necessary to make the Lorentz transformation form a group—and he gave what is now known as the relativistic velocity-addition law.\nPoincaré later delivered a paper at the meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris on 5 June 1905 in which these issues were addressed. In the published version of that he wrote: (PDF) Membres de l'Académie des sciences depuis sa création : Henri Poincare. Sur la dynamique de l' electron.  Note de H. Poincaré. C.R. T.140 (1905) 1504–1508.\n\nThe essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form:\n\nand showed that the arbitrary function  must be unity for all  (Lorentz had set  by a different argument) to make the transformations form a group. In an enlarged version of the paper that appeared in 1906 Poincaré pointed out that the combination  is invariant. He noted that a Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing  as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors. (Wikisource translation) Poincaré expressed a lack of interest in a four-dimensional reformulation of his new mechanics in 1907, because in his opinion the translation of physics into the language of four-dimensional geometry would entail too much effort for limited profit.Walter (2007), Secondary sources on relativity So it was Hermann Minkowski who worked out the consequences of this notion in 1907.\n\nMass–energy relation\nLike others before, Poincaré (1900) discovered a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying the conflict between the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included. He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a mass density of E/c2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it's neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.\n\nHowever, Poincaré's resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.\n\nPoincaré himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904). This time (and later also in 1908) he rejectedMiller 1981, Secondary sources on relativity the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized the ether solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:\n\nHe also discussed two other unexplained effects: (1) non-conservation of mass implied by Lorentz's variable mass , Abraham's theory of variable mass and Kaufmann's experiments on the mass of fast moving electrons and (2) the non-conservation of energy in the radium experiments of Madame Curie.\n\nIt was Albert Einstein's concept of mass–energy equivalence (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount m = E/c2 that resolvedDarrigol 2005, Secondary sources on relativity Poincaré's paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether.. See also English translation. The Hertzian oscillator loses mass in the emission process, and momentum is conserved in any frame. However, concerning Poincaré's solution of the Center of Gravity problem, Einstein noted that Poincaré's formulation and his own from 1906 were mathematically equivalent.\n\nGravitational waves\nIn 1905 Henri Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light.   \"Il importait d'examiner cette hypothèse de plus près et en particulier de rechercher quelles modifications elle nous obligerait à apporter aux lois de la gravitation. C'est ce que j'ai cherché à déterminer; j'ai été d'abord conduit à supposer que la propagation de la gravitation n'est pas instantanée, mais se fait avec la vitesse de la lumière.\"\n\nPoincaré and Einstein\nEinstein's first paper on relativity was published three months after Poincaré's short paper, but before Poincaré's longer version. Einstein relied on the principle of relativity to derive the Lorentz transformations and used a similar clock synchronisation procedure (Einstein synchronisation) to the one that Poincaré (1900) had described, but Einstein's paper was remarkable in that it contained no references at all. Poincaré never acknowledged Einstein's work on special relativity. However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincaré's outlook obliquely in a letter to Hans Vaihinger on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger's general outlook to be close to his own and Poincaré's to be close to Vaihinger's.  See also this letter, with commentary, in  In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincaré posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 called Geometrie und Erfahrung in connection with non-Euclidean geometry, but not in connection with special relativity. A few years before his death, Einstein commented on Poincaré as being one of the pioneers of relativity, saying \"Lorentz had already recognised that the transformation named after him is essential for the analysis of Maxwell's equations, and Poincaré deepened this insight still further ....\"Darrigol 2004, Secondary sources on relativity\n\nAssessments on Poincaré and relativity\n\nPoincaré's work in the development of special relativity is well recognised, though most historians stress that despite many similarities with Einstein's work, the two had very different research agendas and interpretations of the work.Galison 2003 and Kragh 1999, Secondary sources on relativity Poincaré developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection to signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to use the ether-concept in his papers and argued that clocks at rest in the ether show the \"true\" time, and moving clocks show the local time. So Poincaré tried to keep the relativity principle in accordance with classical concepts, while Einstein developed a mathematically equivalent kinematics based on the new physical concepts of the relativity of space and time.Holton (1988), 196–206Hentschel (1990), 3–13Miller (1981), 216–217Darrigol (2005), 15–18Katzir (2005), 286–288\n\nWhile this is the view of most historians, a minority go much further, such as E. T. Whittaker, who held that Poincaré and Lorentz were the true discoverers of relativity.Whittaker 1953, Secondary sources on relativity\n\nAlgebra and number theory\nPoincaré introduced group theory to physics, and was the first to study the group of Lorentz transformations.Poincaré, Selected works in three volumes. page = 682 He also made major contributions to the theory of discrete groups and their representations.\nright|frame |50px |Topological transformation of the torus into a mug \n\nTopology\nThe subject is clearly defined by Felix Klein in his \"Erlangen Program\" (1872): the geometry invariants of arbitrary continuous transformation, a kind of geometry. The term \"topology\" was introduced, as suggested by Johann Benedict Listing, instead of previously used \"Analysis situs\". Some important concepts were introduced by Enrico Betti and Bernhard Riemann. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincaré. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.J. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history. pages = 419–435\n\nHis research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of homotopy and homology. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the fundamental group. Poincaré proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of n-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler–Poincaré theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.\n\nAstronomy and celestial mechanics\nframe|left|150px |   Chaotic motion in three-body problem (computer simulation).\nPoincaré published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892–1899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincaré showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton.J. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history, page 254\n\nThese monographs include an idea of Poincaré, which later became the base for mathematical \"chaos theory\" (see, in particular, the Poincaré recurrence theorem) and the general theory of dynamical systems.\nPoincaré authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincaré received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).A. Kozenko, The theory of planetary figures, pages = 25–26\n\nDifferential equations and mathematical physics\nAfter defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincaré wrote a series of memoirs under the title \"On curves defined by differential equations\" (1881–1882).French: \"Mémoire sur les courbes définies par une équation différentielle\" In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called \"qualitative theory of differential equations\". Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincaré investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincaré also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century Vol = 3. page = 283 Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century. pages = 162–174\n\nCharacter\nthumb|right|Photographic portrait of H. Poincaré by Henri Manuel\nPoincaré's work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincaré was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.\n\nThe mathematician Darboux claimed he was un intuitif (intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. He did not care about being rigorous and disliked logic. (Despite this opinion, Jacques Hadamard wrote that Poincaré's research demonstrated marvelous clarityJ. Hadamard. L'oeuvre de H. Poincaré. Acta Mathematica, 38 (1921), p. 208 and Poincaré himself wrote that he   believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas.)\n\nToulouse's characterisation\nPoincaré's mental organisation was not only interesting to Poincaré himself but also to Édouard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled Henri Poincaré (1910).Toulouse, Édouard, 1910. Henri Poincaré, E. Flammarion, Paris In it, he discussed Poincaré's regular schedule:\n He worked during the same times each day in short periods of time. He undertook mathematical research for four hours a day, between 10 a.m. and noon then again from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.. He would read articles in journals later in the evening.\n His normal work habit was to solve a problem completely in his head, then commit the completed problem to paper.\n He was ambidextrous and nearsighted.\n His ability to visualise what he heard proved particularly useful when he attended lectures, since his eyesight was so poor that he could not see properly what the lecturer wrote on the blackboard.\n\nThese abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:\n He was physically clumsy and artistically inept.\n He was always in a rush and disliked going back for changes or corrections.\n He never spent a long time on a problem since he believed that the subconscious would continue working on the problem while he consciously worked on another problem.\n\nIn addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincaré started from basic principles each time (O'Connor et al., 2002).\n\nHis method of thinking is well summarised as:\n\nAttitude towards transfinite numbers\nPoincaré was dismayed by Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers, and referred to it as a \"disease\" from which mathematics would eventually be cured.Dauben 1979, p. 266.\nPoincaré said, \"There is no actual infinite; the Cantorians have forgotten this, and that is why they have fallen into contradiction.\", p 190\n\nHonours\nAwards\nOscar II, King of Sweden's mathematical competition (1887)\nForeign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1897)\nAmerican Philosophical Society 1899\nGold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society of London (1900)\nBolyai Prize in 1905\nMatteucci Medal 1905\nFrench Academy of Sciences 1906\nAcadémie française 1909\nBruce Medal (1911)\n\nNamed after him\nInstitut Henri Poincaré (mathematics and theoretical physics center)\nPoincaré Prize (Mathematical Physics International Prize)\nAnnales Henri Poincaré (Scientific Journal)\nPoincaré Seminar (nicknamed \"Bourbaphy\")\nThe crater Poincaré on the Moon\nAsteroid 2021 Poincaré\nList of things named after Henri Poincaré\n\nHenri Poincaré did not receive the Nobel Prize in Physics, but he had influential advocates like Henri Becquerel or committee member Gösta Mittag-Leffler. The nomination archive reveals that Poincaré received a total of 51 nominations between 1904 and 1912, the year of his death. Of the 58 nominations for the 1910 Nobel Prize, 34 named Poincaré. Nominators included Nobel laureates Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman (both of 1902), Marie Curie (of 1903), Albert Michelson (of 1907), Gabriel Lippmann (of 1908) and Guglielmo Marconi (of 1909).\n\nThe fact that renowned theoretical physicists like Poincaré, Boltzmann or Gibbs were not awarded the Nobel Prize is seen as evidence that the Nobel committee had more regard for experimentation than theory. In Poincaré's case, several of those who nominated him pointed out that the greatest problem was to name a specific discovery, invention, or technique.\n\nPhilosophy\nPoincaré had philosophical views opposite to those of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, who believed that mathematics was a branch of logic. Poincaré strongly disagreed, claiming that intuition was the life of mathematics. Poincaré gives an interesting point of view in his book Science and Hypothesis:\n\nPoincaré believed that arithmetic is a synthetic science. He argued that Peano's axioms cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is a priori synthetic and not analytic. Poincaré then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of Immanuel Kant (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian set theory, objecting to its use of impredicative definitions.\n\nHowever, Poincaré did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincaré believed that the structure of non-Euclidean space can be known analytically. Poincaré held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as \"conventionalism\". Poincaré believed that Newton's first law was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012). He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincaré thought that we were so accustomed to Euclidean geometry that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to a non-Euclidean physical geometry.\n\nFree will\nPoincaré's famous lectures before the Société de Psychologie in Paris (published as Science and Hypothesis, The Value of Science, and Science and Method) were cited by Jacques Hadamard as the source for the idea that creativity and invention consist of two mental stages, first random combinations of possible solutions to a problem, followed by a critical evaluation.Hadamard, Jacques. An Essay on the Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field. Princeton Univ Press (1945)\n\nAlthough he most often spoke of a deterministic universe, Poincaré said that the subconscious generation of new possibilities involves chance.\nIt is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind in a kind of sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.Science and Method, Chapter 3, Mathematical Discovery, 1914, pp.58\n\nPoincaré's two stages—random combinations followed by selection—became the basis for Daniel Dennett's two-stage model of free will.Dennett, Daniel C. 1978.

In particular, the law of the excluded middle does not hold in general, though the induction axiom can be used to prove many specific cases.  For instance, one can prove that  is a theorem (any two natural numbers are either equal to each other, or not equal to each other). In fact, since \"=\" is the only predicate symbol in Heyting arithmetic, it then follows that, for any quantifier-free formula p,  is a theorem (where x, y, z… are the free variables in p).\n\nHistory\nKurt Gödel studied the relationship between Heyting arithmetic and Peano arithmetic.  He used the Gödel–Gentzen negative translation to prove in 1933 that if HA is consistent, then PA is also consistent.\n\nRelated concepts\nHeyting arithmetic should not be confused with Heyting algebras, which are the intuitionistic analogue of Boolean algebras.\n\nSee also\nHarrop formula\nBHK interpretation\nRealizability\n\nReferences\nUlrich Kohlenbach (2008), Applied proof theory, Springer.\nAnne S.

      "text": "The history of the Church–Turing thesis (\"thesis\") involves the history of the development of the study of the nature of functions whose values are effectively calculable; or, in more modern terms, functions whose values are algorithmically computable. It is an important topic in modern mathematical theory and computer science, particularly associated with the work of Alonzo Church and Alan Turing.\n\nThe debate and discovery of the meaning of \"computation\" and \"recursion\" has been long and contentious.  This article provides detail of that debate and discovery from Peano's axioms in 1889 through recent discussion of the meaning of \"axiom\".\n\nPeano's nine axioms of arithmetic\nIn 1889, Giuseppe Peano presented his The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method, based on the work of Dedekind. Soare proposes that the origination of \"primitive recursion\" began formally with the axioms of Peano, although\n\"Well before the nineteenth century mathematicians used the principle of defining a function by induction. Dedekind 1888 proved, using accepted axioms, that such a definition defines a unique function, and he applied it to the definition of the functions m+n, m x n, and mn. Based on this work of Dedekind, Peano 1889 and 1891 wrote the familiar five [sic] axioms for the positive integers. As a companion to his fifth [sic] axiom, mathematical induction, Peano used definition by induction, which has been called primitive recursion (since Péter 1934 and Kleene 1936) ... .\"Soare 1996:5\n\nObserve that in fact Peano's axioms are 9 in number and axiom 9 is the recursion/induction axiom.cf: van Heijenoort 1976:94\n\n\"Subsequently the 9 were reduced to 5 as \"Axioms 2, 3, 4 and 5 which deal with identity, belong to the underlying logic. This leaves the five axioms that have become universally known as \"the Peano axioms ... Peano acknowledges (1891b, p. 93) that his axioms come from Dedekind ... .\"van Heijenoort 1976:83\n\nHilbert and the Entscheidungsproblem\nAt the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1900 in Paris the famous mathematician David Hilbert posed a set of problems – now known as Hilbert's problems – his beacon illuminating the way for mathematicians of the twentieth century. Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems introduced the Entscheidungsproblem (the \"decision problem\"). In his 2nd problem he asked for a proof that \"arithmetic\" is \"consistent\". Kurt Gödel would prove in 1931 that, within what he called \"P\" (nowadays called Peano Arithmetic), \"there exist undecidable sentences [propositions]\".Gödel 1931a in (Davis 1965:6), 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:596) Because of this, \"the consistency of P is unprovable in P, provided P is consistent\".Gödel’s theorem IX, Gödel 1931a in (Davis 1965:36)  While Gödel’s proof would display the tools necessary for Alonzo Church and Alan Turing to resolve the Entscheidungsproblem, he himself would not answer it.\n\nIt is within Hilbert's 10th problem where the question of an \"Entscheidungsproblem\" actually appears.   The heart of matter was the following question: \"What do we mean when we say that a function is 'effectively calculable'\"?  The answer would be something to this effect: \"When the function is calculated by a mechanical procedure (process, method).\"  Although stated easily nowadays, the question (and answer) would float about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely.\n\nHilbert's original description of problem 10 begins as follows:\n\"10. Determination of the solvability of a Diophantine equation.  Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with rational integral coefficients: To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.This translation, and the original text in German, appears in (Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007:1-2)\"\n\nBy 1922, the specific question of an \"Entscheidungsproblem\" applied to Diophantine equations had developed into the more general question about a \"decision method\" for any mathematical formula. \nMartin Davis explains it this way: Suppose we are given a \"calculational procedure\" that consists of (1) a set of axioms and (2) a logical conclusion written in first-order logic, that is—written in what Davis calls \"Frege's rules of deduction\" (or the modern equivalent of Boolean logic).  Gödel’s doctoral dissertationGödel 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:592ff) proved that Frege's rules were complete \"... in the sense that every valid formula is provable\".van Heijenoort 1967:582  Given that encouraging fact, could there be a generalized \"calculational procedure\" that would tell us whether a conclusion can be derived from its premises?  Davis calls such calculational procedures \"algorithms\".  The Entscheidungsproblem would be an algorithm as well.  \"In principle, an algorithm for [the] Entscheidungsproblem would have reduced all human deductive reasoning to brute calculation\".Davis 2000:146\n\nIn other words: Is there an \"algorithm\" that can tell us if any formula is \"true\" (i.e. an algorithm that always correctly yields a judgment \"truth\" or \"falsehood\"?)\n\" ... it seemed clear to Hilbert that with the solution of this problem, the Entscheidungsproblem, that it should be possible in principle to settle all mathematical questions in a purely mechanical manner.  Hence, given unsolvable problems at all, if Hilbert was correct, then the Entscheidungsproblem itself should be unsolvable\".Davis 1965:108\n\nIndeed: What about our Entscheidungsproblem algorithm itself?  Can it determine, in a finite number of steps, whether it, itself, is “successful” and \"truthful\" (that is, it does not get hung up in an endless \"circle\" or \"loop\", and it correctly yields a judgment \"truth\" or \"falsehood\" about its own behavior and results)?\n\nThree problems from Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems\nAt the 1928 Congress [in Bologna, Italy] Hilbert refines the question very carefully into three parts. The following is Stephen Hawking's summary:\n\"1. To prove that all true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the completeness of mathematics.\n\"2. To prove that only true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the consistency of mathematics,\n\"3. To prove the decidability of mathematics, that is, the existence of a decision procedure to decide the truth or falsity of any given mathematical proposition.\" Hawking 2005:1121\n\nSimple arithmetic functions irreducible to primitive recursion\nGabriel Sudan (1927) and Wilhelm Ackermann (1928) display recursive functions that are not primitive recursive:\n\n\"Are there recursions that are not reducible to primitive recursion; and in particular can recursion be used to define a function which is not primitive recursive?\n\n\"This question arose from a conjecture of Hilbert in 1926 on the continuum problem, and was answered [yes: there are recursions that are not primitive recursive] by Ackermann 1928.\"Kleene 1952:271\n\nIn subsequent years Kleenecf. Kleene 1952:272-273 observes that Rózsa Péter (1935) simplified Ackermann's example (\"cf. also Hilbert-Bernays 1934\") and Raphael Robinson (1948). Péter exhibited another example (1935) that employed Cantor's diagonal argument. Péter (1950) and Ackermann (1940) also displayed \"transfinite recursions\", and this led Kleene to wonder:\n\"... whether we can characterize in any exact way the notion of any \"recursion\", or the class of all \"recursive functions.\"Kleene 1952:273\n\nKleene concludescf. Kleene 1952:274 that all \"recursions\" involve (i) the formal analysis he presents in his §54 Formal calculations of primitive recursive functions and, (ii) the use of mathematical induction. He immediately goes on to state that indeed the Gödel-Herbrand definition does indeed \"characterize all recursive functions\" – see the quote in 1934, below.\n\nGödel's proof\nIn 1930, mathematicians gathered for a mathematics meeting and retirement event for Hilbert. As luck would have it,\n\"at the very same meeting, a young Czech mathematician, Kurt Gödel, announced results which dealt it [Hilbert's opinion that all three answers were YES] a serious blow.\"Hodges 1983:92\n\nHe announced that the answer to the first two of Hilbert's three questions of 1928 was NO.\n\nSubsequently in 1931 Gödel published his famous paper On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related  In his preface to this paper Martin Davis delivers a caution:\n\"The reader should be warned that [in this particular paper] what Gödel calls recursive functions  are now called primitive recursive functions. (The revised terminology was introduced by KleeneKleene 1936 in (Davis 1965:237ff)).\"Davis 1965:4\n\nGödel  expansion of \"effective calculation\"\nTo quote Kleene (1952), \"The characterization of all \"recursive functions\" was accomplished in the definition of 'general recursive function' by Gödel 1934, who built on a suggestion of Herbrand\" (Kleene 1952:274). Gödel delivered a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), Princeton NJ. In a preface written by Martin DavisDavis 1965:39–40 Davis observes that\n\"Dr. Gödel has stated in a letter that he was, at the time of these lectures, not at all convinced that his concept of recursion comprised all possible recursions ...\"Davis 1965:40\n\nDawson states that these lectures were meant to clarify concerns that the \"incompleteness theorems were somehow dependent on the particularities of formalization\":(Dawson 1997:101)\n\n\"Gödel mentioned Ackermann's example in the final section of his 1934 paper, as a way of motivating the concept of \"general recursive function\" that he defined there; but earlier in footnote 3, he had already conjectured (as \"a heuristic principle\") that all finitarily computable functions could be obtained through recursions of such more general sorts.\n\n\"The conjecture has since elicited much comment. In particular, when Martin Davis undertook to publish Gödel's 1934 lectures [in Davis 1965:41ff] he took it to be a variant of Church's Thesis; but in a letter to Davis ...[246: \"KG to Martin Davis, 15 February 1965, Quoted in Gödel 1986–, vol. I, p. 341\"] Gödel stated emphatically that that was \"not true\" because at the time of those lectures he was \"not at all convinced\" that his concept of recursion comprised \"all possible recursions.\" Rather, he said, \"The conjecture stated there only refers to the equivalence of 'finite (computation) procedure' and 'recursive procedure.'\" To clarify the issue Gödel added a postscript to the lectures,Gödel 1964 in (Davis 1965:247) also reprinted in (Gödel 1986, vol. I:369–371) in which he indicated that what had finally convinced him that the intuitively computable functions coincided with those that were general recursive was Alan Turing's work .\n\"Gödel's reluctance to regard either general recursiveness or λ-definability as adequate characterization of the informal notion of effective computability has been examined in detail by several authors [Footnote 248: \"See especially Davis 1982; Gandy 1980 and 1988; Sieg 1994\"]. There is a consensus that, in fact, neither Gödel's nor Church's formalisms were so perspicuous or intrinsically persuasive as Alan Turing's analysis, and Wilfried Sieg has argued that the evidence in favor of Church's Thesis provided by the \"confluence of different notions\" (the fact that the systems proposed by Church, Gödel, Post and Alan Turing all turned out to have the same extension) is less compelling than has generally supposed. Hence, quite apart from Gödel's innate caution there were good reasons for his skepticism. But what, then, was he attempting to achieve through his notion of general recursiveness? ...\n\n\"Rather, Gödel obtained his definition [of the class of general recursive functions] through modification of Herbrand's ideas ...; and Wilfried Sieg has argued that his real purpose in the final section of the 1934 paper [the lecture notes] was \"to disassociate recursive functions from [Herbrand's] epistemologically restricted notion of proof\" by specifying \"mechanical rules for deriving equations.\" What was more general about Gödel's notion of \"general\" recursiveness was, Sieg suggests, that Herbrand had intended only to characterize those functions that could be proved to be recursive by finitary means [250].\"Italics in the original Dawson 1997:101–102\n\nKleene\nKleene and Rosser transcribed Gödel's 1934 lectures in Princeton. In his paper General Recursive Functions of Natural NumbersKleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:236ff) Kleene states:\n\n\"A definition of general recursive function of natural numbers was suggested by Herbrand to Gödel, and was used by Gödel with an important modification in a series of lectures at Princeton in 1934 ...Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:237)\n\n\"A recursive function (relation) in the sense of Gödel ... will now be called a primitive recursive function (relation).Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:239)\n\nChurch definition of \"effectively calculable\"\nChurch's paper An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory (1936) proved that the Entscheidungsproblem was undecidable within the λ-calculus and Gödel-Herbrand's general recursion; moreover Church cites two theorems of Kleene's that proved that the functions defined in the λ-calculus are identical to the functions defined by general recursion:\n\"Theorem XVI. Every recursive function of positive integers is λ-definable.16\n\"Theorem XVII. Every λ-definable function of positive integers is recursive.17\n\"16 ... .  In the form here it was first obtained by Kleene... .\n\"17 This result was obtained independently by the present author and S. C. Kleene at about the same time.\n\nThe paper opens with a very long footnote, 3. Another footnote, 9, is also of interest. Martin Davis states that \"This paper is principally important for its explicit statement (since known as Church's thesis) that the functions which can be computed by a finite algorithm are precisely the recursive functions, and for the consequence that an explicit unsolvable problem can be given\":Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:88)\n\n\"3 As will appear, this definition of effective calculability can be stated in either of two equivalent forms, (1) ... λ-definable ... 2) ... recursive ... . The notion of λ-definability is due jointly to the present author and S. C. Kleene, successive steps towards it having been taken by the present author in the Annals of Mathematics, vol. 34 (1933), p. 863, and Kleene in the American Journal of Mathematics, vol. 57 (1935), p. 219. The notion of recursiveness in the sense of §4 below is due jointly to Jacques Herbrand and Kurt Gödel, as is there explained. And the proof of equivalence of the two notions is due chiefly to Kleene, but also partly to the present author and to J. B. Rosser ... . The proposal to identify these notions with the intuitive notion of effective calculability is first made in the present paper (but see the first footnote to §7 below).\n\n\"With the aid of the methods of Kleene (American Journal of Mathematics, 1935), the considerations of the present paper could, with comparatively slight modification be carried through entirely in terms of λ-definability, without making use of the notion of recursiveness. On the other hand, since the results of the present paper were obtained, it has been shown by Kleene (see his forthcoming paper, \"General recursive functions of natural numbers\") that analogous results can be obtained entirely in terms of recursiveness, without making use of λ-definability. The fact, however, that two such widely different and (in the opinion of the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability turn out to be equivalent adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below for believing that they constitute as general a characterization of this notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of it.\"Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:90)\n\nFootnote 9 is in section §4 Recursive functions:\n\" 9This definition [of \"recursive\"] is closely related to, and was suggested by, a definition of recursive functions which was proposed by Kurt Gödel, in lectures at Princeton, N. J., 1934, and credited by him in part to an unpublished suggestion of Jacques Herbrand. The principal features in which present definition of recursiveness differs from Gödel's are due to S. C. Kleene.\n\" In a forthcoming paper by Kleene to be entitled \"General recursive functions of natural numbers,\" ... it follows ... that every function recursive in the present sense is also recursive in the sense of Gödel (1934) and conversely.\"Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:95)\n\nSome time prior to Church's paper An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory (1936) a dialog occurred between Gödel and Church as to whether or not λ-definability was sufficient for the definition of the notion of \"algorithm\" and \"effective calculability\".\n\nIn Church (1936) we see, under the chapter §7 The notion of effective calculability, a footnote 18 which states the following:\n\"18The question of the relationship between effective calculability and recursiveness (which it is here proposed to answer by identifying the two notions) was raised by Gödel in conversation with the author. The corresponding question of the relationship between effective calculability and λ-definability had previously been proposed by the author independently.\" Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:100)\n\nBy \"identifying\" Church means – not \"establishing the identity of\" – but rather \"to cause to be or become identical\", \"to conceive as united\" (as in spirit, outlook or principle) (vt form), and (vi form) as \"to be or become the same\".Merriam-Webster 1983:identifying\n\nPost and \"effective calculability\" as \"natural law\"\nPost's doubts as to whether or not recursion was an adequate definition of \"effective calculability\", plus the publishing of Church's paper, encouraged him in the fall of 1936 to propose a \"formulation\" with \"psychological fidelity\": A worker moves through \"a sequence of spaces or boxes\"Post 1936 in (Davis 1965:289) performing machine-like \"primitive acts\" on a sheet of paper in each box. The worker is equipped with \"a fixed ualterable set of directions\". Each instruction consists of three or four symbols: (1) an identifying label/number, (2) an operation, (3) next instruction ji; however, if the instruction is of type (e) and the determination is \"yes\" THEN instruction ji' ELSE if it is \"no\" instruction ji. The \"primitive acts\" are of only 1 of 5 types: (a) mark the paper in the box he's in (or over-mark a mark already there), (b) erase the mark (or over-erase), (c) move one room to the right, (d) move one room to the left, (e) determine if the paper is marked or blank. The worker starts at step 1 in the starting-room, and does what the instructions instruct them to do. (See more at Post–Turing machine.)\n\nThis matter, mentioned in the introduction about \"intuitive theories\" caused Post to take a potent poke at Church:\n\"The writer expects the present formulation to turn out to be logically equivalent to recursiveness in the sense of the Gödel-Church development.7 Its purpose, however, is not only to present a system of a certain logical potency but also, in its restricted field, of psychological fidelity. In the latter sense wider and wider formulations are contemplated. On the other hand, our aim will be to show that all such are logically reducible to formulation 1. We offer this conclusion at the present moment as a working hypothesis. And to our mind such is Church's identification of effective calculability with recursivness.8\" (italics in original)\n7 [he sketches an approach to a proof]\n8 \"Cf. Church, lock. cit, pp. 346, 356-358. Actually the work already done by Church and others carries this identification considerably beyond the working hypothesis stage. But to mask this identification under a definition hides the fact that a fundamental discovery in the limitiations of mathematicizing power of Homo Sapiens has been made and blinds us to the need of its continual verification.\"italics added, Post 1936 in (Davis 1965:291)\n\nIn other words Post is saying \"Just because you defined it so doesn't make it truly so; your definition is based on no more than an intuition.\" Post was searching for more than a definition: \"The success of the above program would, for us, change this hypothesis not so much to a definition or to an axiom but to a natural law. Only so, it seems to the writer, can Gödel's theorem ... and Church's results ... be transformed into conclusions concerning all symbolic logics and all methods of solvability.\"Italics in original, Post in (Davis 1965:291)\n\nThis contentious stance finds grumpy expression in Alan Turing 1939, and it will reappear with Gödel, Gandy, and Sieg.\n\nTuring and computability\nA. M. Turing's paper On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem was delivered to the London Mathematical Society in November 1936. Again the reader must bear in mind a caution: as used by Turing, the word \"computer\" is a human being, and the action of a \"computer\" he calls \"computing\"; for example, he states \"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper\" (p. 135). But he uses the word \"computation\" in (Davis 1967:118) in the context of his machine-definition, and his definition of \"computable\" numbers is as follows:\n\"The \"computable\" numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means ... .According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine.\"  in (Davis 1967:116)\n\nWhat is Turing's definition of his \"machine?\" Turing gives two definitions, the first a summary in §1 Computing machines and another very similar in §9.I derived from his more detailed analysis of the actions a human \"computer\". With regards to his definition §1 he says that \"justification lies in the fact that the human memory is necessarily limited\", in (Davis 1967:117) and he concludes §1 with the bald assertion of his proposed machine with his use of the word \"all\"\n\n\"It is my contention that these operations [write symbol on tape-square, erase symbol, shift one square left, shift one square right, scan square for symbol and change machine-configuration as a consequence of one scanned symbol] include all those which are used in the computation of a number.\"\n\nThe emphasis of the word one in the above brackets is intentional. With regards to §9.I he allows the machine to examine more squares; it is this more-square sort of behavior that he claims typifies the actions of a computer (person):\n\"The machine scans B squares corresponding to the B squares observed by the computer. In any move the machine can change a symbol on a scanned square or can change any one of the scanned squares to another square distant not more than L squares from one of the other scanned squares ... The machines just described do not differ very essentially from computing machines as defined in §2 [sic], and corresponding to any machine of this type a computing machine can be constructed to compute the same sequence, that is to say the sequence computed by the computer.\" in (Davis 1967:138)\n\nTuring goes on to define a \"computing machine\" in §2 is (i) \"a-machine\" (\"automatic machine\") as defined in §1 with the added restriction (ii): (ii) It prints two kinds of symbols – figures 0 and 1 – and other symbols. The figures 0 and 1 will represent \"the sequence computed by the machine\".\n\nFurthermore, to define the if the number is to be considered \"computable\", the machine must print an infinite number of 0's and 1's; if not it is considered to be \"circular\"; otherwise it is considered to be \"circle-free\":\n\"A number is computable if it differs by an integer from the number computed by a circle-free machine.\"  in (Davis 1967:119)\n\nAlthough he doesn't call it his \"thesis\", Turing proposes a proof that his \"computability\" is equivalent to Church's \"effective calculability\":\n\"In a recent paper Alonzo Church has introduced an idea of \"effective calculability\", which is equivalent to my \"computability\", but is very differently defined ... The proof of equivalence between \"computability\" and \"effective calculability\" is outlined in an appendix to the present paper.\"\n\nThe Appendix: Computability and effective calculability begins in the following manner; observe that he does not mention recursion here, and in fact his proof-sketch has his machine munch strings of symbols in the λ-calculus and the calculus munch \"complete configurations\" of his machine, and nowhere is recursion mentioned. The proof of the equivalence of machine-computability and recursion must wait for Kleene 1943 and 1952:\n\"The theorem that all effectively calculable (λ-definable) sequences are computable and its converse are proved below in outline.\" in (Davis 1967:149)\n\nGandy (1960) seems to confuse this bold proof-sketch with Church's Thesis; see 1960 and 1995 below. Moreover a careful reading of Turing's definitions leads the reader to observe that Turing was asserting that the \"operations\" of his proposed machine in §1 are sufficient to compute any computable number, and the machine that imitates the action of a human \"computer\" as presented in §9.I is a variety of this proposed machine. This point will be reiterated by Turing in 1939.\n\nTuring identifies effective calculability with machine computation\nAlan Turing's massive Princeton PhD thesis (under Alonzo Church) appears as Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals. In it he summarizes the quest for a definition of \"effectively calculable\". He proposes a definition as shown in the boldface type that specifically identifies (renders identical) the notions of \"machine computation\" and \"effectively calculable\".\n\n\"A function is said to be \"effectively calculable\" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematically expressible definition. Such a definition was first given by Gödel at Princeton in 1934 ... . These functions are described as \"general recursive\" by Gödel ... .  Another definition of effective calculability has been given by Church ... who identifies it with λ-definability. The author has recently suggested a definition corresponding more closely to the intuitive idea (Turing [1], see also Post's [1]). It was stated above that \"a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process\". We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability † with effective calculability. It is not difficult, though somewhat laborious, to prove that these three definitions are equivalent.Kleene [3], Turing [2]\n\"† We shall use the expression \"computable function\" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let \"effectively calculable\" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions. We do not restrict the values taken by a computable function to be natural numbers; we may for instance have computable propositional functions.\"boldface added, Turing 1939 in (Davis 1965:160)\n\nThis is a powerful expression. because \"identicality\" is actually an unequivocal statement of necessary and sufficient conditions, in other words there are no other contingencies to the identification\" except what interpretation is given to the words \"function\", \"machine\", \"computable\", and \"effectively calculable\":\n For all functions: IF \"this function is computable by machine\" THEN \"this function is effectively calculable\" AND IF \"this function is effectively calculable\" THEN \"this function is computable by a machine.\"\n\nRosser: recursion, λ-calculus, and Turing-machine computation identity\nJ. B. Rosser's paper An Informal Exposition of Proofs of Gödel's Theorem and Church's TheoremRosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:223-230) states the following:\n\n\"'Effective method' is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date5. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that an effective method of solving a certain set of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer. All three definitions are equivalent, so it does not matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.\n\n5 One definition is given by Church in I [i.e. Church 1936 An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number theory]. Another definition is due to Jacques Herbrand and Kurt Gödel. It is stated in I, footnote 3, p. 346. The third definition was given independently in two slightly different forms by E. L. Post ... and A. M. Turing ... . The first two definitions are proved equivalent in I. The third is proved equivalent to the first two by A. M. Turing, Computability and λ-definability [Journal of Symbolic Logic, vol. 2 (1937), pp. 153-163].\" quote and footnote from Rosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:225-226)\n\nKleene and Thesis I\nKleene defines \"general recursive\" functions and \"partial recursive functions\" in his paper Recursive Predicates and Quantifiers. The representing function, mu-operator, etc make their appearance. He goes on in §12 Algorithm theories to state his famous Thesis I, what he would come to call Church's Thesis in 1952:\n\n\"This heuristic fact, as well as certain reflections on the nature of symbolic algorithmic processes, led Church to state the following thesis22. The same thesis is implicitly in Turing's description of computing machines23.\n\n\"Thesis I. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive.\n\n\"Since a precise mathematical definition of the term effectively calculable (effectively decidable) has been wanting, we can take this thesis, together with the principle already accepted to which it is converse, as a definition of it ... the thesis has the character of an hypothesis – a point emphasized by Post and by Church24.\n22 Church [1] [An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory]Church 1936a in (Davis 1965:88ff)\n23 Turing [1] [On Computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem(1936)], in (Davis 1965:115ff)\n24 Post [1, p. 105],Post, 1936, Finite combinatory processes - Formulation 1, The Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Sep., 1936), pp. 103-105 and Church [2]  Church, 1938, The constructive second number class, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. vol. 44, Number 4, 1938, pp. 224-232]\n\nKleene and Church and Turing theses\nIn his chapter §60, Kleene defines the \"Church's thesis\" as follows:\n\" ... heuristic evidence and other considerations led Church 1936 to propose the following thesis.\n\"Thesis I. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive.\n\"This thesis is also implicit in the conception of a computing machine formulated by Turing 1936-7 and Post 1936.\"Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:300-301)\n\nOn page 317 he explicitly calls the above thesis \"Church's thesis\":\n\"§62. Church's thesis. One of the main objectives of this and the next chapter is to present the evidence for Church's thesis (Thesis I §60).\" Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:317)\n\nAbout Turing's \"formulation\", Kleene says:\n\"Turing's formulation hence constitutes an independent statement of Church's thesis (in equivalent terms). Post 1936 gave a similar formulation.\"Post 1936:321\n\nKleene proposes that what Turing showed: \"Turing's computable functions (1936-1937) are those which can be computed by a machine of a kind which is designed, according to his analysis, to reproduce all the sorts of operations which a human computer could perform, working according to preassigned instructions.\" Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:321)\n\nThis interpretation of Turing plays into Gandy's concern that a machine specification may not explicitly \"reproduce all the sorts of operations which a human computer could perform\" – i.e. his two examples are (i) massively symbol-parallel computation and two-dimensional computation e.g. Conway's \"game of life\".cf. Gandy 1978 in (Barwise et al 1980:125) Therefore there may be processes that can \"compute more\" than a Turing machine can. See 1980 below.\n\nKleene defines Turing's Thesis as follows:\n\"§70. Turing's thesis. Turing's thesis that every function which would naturally be regarded as computable under his definition, i.e. by one of his machines, is equivalent to Church's thesis by Theorem XXX.\"\n\nIndeed immediately before this statement, Kleene states the Theorem XXX:\n\"Theorem XXX (= Theorems XXVIII + XXIX). The following classes of partial functions are coextensive, i.e. have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions, (c) the 1/1 computable functions. Similarly with l [lower-case L] completely defined assumed functions Ψ.\"\n\nGödel, Turing machines, and effectively calculability\nTo his 1931 paper On Formally Undecidable Propositions, Gödel added a Note added 28 August 1963 which clarifies his opinion of the alternative forms/expression of \"a formal system\". He reiterates his opinions even more clearly in 1964 (see below):\n\n\"Note Added 28 August 1963. In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact that due to A. M. Turing's work69 a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system70 can now be given, a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible. That is, it can be proved rigorously that in every consistent formal system that contains a certain amount of finitary number theory there exist undecidable arithmetic propositions and that, moreover, the consistency of any such system cannot be proved in the system.\n\n\"69 See , p. 249.\n\n\"70 In my opinion the term \"formal system\" or \"formalism\" should never be used for anything but this notion. In a lecture at Princeton (mentioned in Princeton University 1946, p. 11 [see Davis 1965, pp. 84-88 [i.e. Davis p. 84-88] ]), I suggested certain transfinite generalizations of formalisms, but these are something radically different from formal systems in the proper sense of the term, whose characteristic property is that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices.\"Gödel 1963 in (van Heijenoort 1976:616)\n\nGödel 1964 – In Gödel's Postscriptum to his lecture's notes of 1934 at the IAS at Princeton,Due to the language difference, Gödel refers to the IAS as \"AIS\" he repeats, but reiterates in even more bold terms, his less-than-glowing opinion about the efficacy of computability as defined by Church's λ-definability and recursion (we have to infer that both are denigrated because of his use of the plural \"definitions\" in the following). This was in a letter to Martin Davis (presumably as he was assembling The Undecidable). The repeat of some of the phrasing is striking:\n\n\"In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact, that, due to A. M. Turing's work, a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be given, the existence of undecidable arithmetical propositions and the non-demonstrability of the consistence of a system in the same system can now be proved rigorously for every consistent formal system containing a certain amount of finitary number theory.\n\n\"Turing's work gives an analysis of the concept of \"mechanical procedure\" (alias \"algorithm\" or \"computation procedure\" or \"finite combinatorial procedure\"). This concept is shown to be equivalent to that of a \"Turing machine\".* A formal system can simply be defined to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas ... the concept of formal system, whose essence it is that reasoning is completely replaced by mechanical operations on formulas. (Note that the question of whether there exist finite non-mechanical procedures ... not equivalent with any algorithm, has nothing whatsoever to do with the adequacy of the definition of \"formal system\" and of \"mechanical procedure.\n\n\"... if \"finite procedure\" is understood to mean \"mechanical procedure\", the question raised in footnote 3 can be answered affirmatively for recursiveness as defined in §9, which is equivalent to general recursiveness as defined today (see S. C. Kleene (1936) ...)\" Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:71-73)\n\n\" * See  ... and the almost simultaneous paper by E. L. Post (1936) ... . As for previous equivalent definitions of computability, which however, are much less suitable for our purpose, see A. Church 1936 ...\"Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:72)\n\nFootnote 3 is in the body of the 1934 lecture notes:\n\"3 The converse seems to be true, if besides recursions according to the scheme (2) recursions of other forms (e.g., with respect to two variables simultaneously) are admitted. This cannot be proved, since the notion of finite computation is not defined, but it serves as a heuristic principle.\"Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:44)\n\nDavis does observe that \"in fact the equivalence between his [Gödel's] definition [of recursion] and Kleene's [1936] is not quite trivial. So, despite appearances to the contrary, footnote 3 of these lectures is not a statement of Church's thesis.\"Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:40)\n\nGandy: \"machine computation\", discrete, deterministic, and limited to \"local causation\" by light speed\n\nRobin Gandy's influential paper titled Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms appears in Barwise et al. Gandy starts off with an unlikely expression of Church's Thesis, framed as follows:\n\n\"1. Introduction\n\"Throughout this paper we shall use \"calculable\" to refer to some intuitively given notion and \"computable\" to mean \"computable by a Turing machine\"; of course many equivalent definitions of \"computable\" are now available.\n\"Church's Thesis. What is effectively calculable is computable.\n\" ... Both Church and Turing had in mind calculation by an abstract human being using some mechanical aids (such as paper and pencil)\"Gandy in (Barwise 1980:123)\n\nRobert Soare (1995, see below) had issues with this framing, considering Church's paper (1936) published prior to Turing's \"Appendix proof\" (1937).\n\nGandy attempts to \"analyze mechanical processes and so to provide arguments for the following:\n\"Thesis M. What can be calculated by a machine is computable.\" Gandy in (Barwise 1980:124\n\nGandy \"exclude[s] from consideration devices which are essentially analogue machines ... .The only physical presuppositions made about mechanical devices (Cf Principle IV below) are that there is a lower bound on the linear dimensions of every atomic part of the device and that there is an upper bound (the velocity of light) on the speed of propagation of change\".Gandy in (Barwise 1980:126) But then he restricts his machines even more:\n\"(2) Secondly we suppose that the progress of calculation by a mechanical device may be described in discrete terms, so that the devices considered are, in a loose sense, digital computers.\n\"(3) Lasty we suppose that the device is deterministic: that is, the subsequent behavior of the device is uniquely determined once a complete description of its initial state is given.\"\n\nHe in fact makes an argument for this \"Thesis M\" that he calls his \"Theorem\", the most important \"Principle\" of which is \"Principle IV: Principle of local causation\":\n\"Now we come to the most important of our principles. In Turing's analysis the requirement that the action depended only on a bounded portion of the record was based on a human limitation. We replace this by a physical limitation which we call the principle of local causation. Its justification lies in the finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals: contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance.\"Gandy in (Barwise 1980:135)\n\nSoare\nSoare's thorough examination of Computability and Recursion appears. He quotes Gödel's 1964 opinion (above) with respect to the \"much less suitable\" definition of computability, and goes on to add:\n\"Kleene wrote [1981b, p. 49], \"Turing's computability is intrinsically persuasive\" but \"λ-definability is not intrinsically persuasive\" and \"general recursiveness scarcely so (its author Gödel being at the time not at all persuaded) ... . Most people today accept Turing's Thesis\"Soare 1996:13\n\nSoare's footnote 7 (1995) also catches Gandy's \"confusion\", but apparently it continues into Gandy (1988). This confusion represents a serious error of research and/or thought and remains a cloud hovering over his whole program:\n\"7Gandy actually wrote \"Church's thesis\" not \"Turing's thesis\" as written here, but surely Gandy meant the latter, at least intensionally, because Turing did not prove anything in 1936 or anywhere else about general recursive functions.\"Soare 1996:11\n\nBreger and problem of tacit axioms\nBreger points out a problem when one is approaching a notion \"axiomatically\", that is, an \"axiomatic system\" may have imbedded in it one or more tacit axioms that are unspoken when the axiom-set is presented.\n\nFor example, an active agent with knowledge (and capability) may be a (potential) fundamental axiom in any axiomatic system: \"the know-how of a human being is necessary – a know-how which is not formalized in the axioms. ¶ ... Mathematics as a purely formal system of symbols without a human being possessing the know-how with the symbols is impossible ...\"Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:221)\n\nHe quotes Hilbert:\n \"In a university lecture given in 1905, Hilbert considered it \"absolutely necessary\" to have an \"axiom of thought\" or \"an axiom of the existence of an intelligence\" before stating the axioms in logic. In the margin of the script, Hilbert added later: \"the a priori of the philosophers.\" He formulated this axiom as follows: \"I have the capacity to think of objects, and to denote them by means of simple symbols like a, b,..., x, y,..., so that they can be recognized unambiguously. My thought operates with these objects in a certain way according to certain rules, and my thinking is able to detect these rules by observation of myself, and completely to describe these rules\" [(Hilbert 1905,219); see also (Peckhaus 1990, 62f and 227)].\"brackets and references in original, Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:227)\n\nBreger further supports his argument with examples from Giuseppe Veronese (1891) and Hermann Weyl (1930-1). He goes on to discuss the problem of then expression of an axiom-set in a particular language: i.e. a language known by the agent, e.g. German.Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228)Indeed, Breger gives a potent example of this in his paper (Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228-118))\n\nSee more about this at Algorithm characterizations, in particular Searle's opinion that outside any computation there must be an observer that gives meaning to the symbols used.\n\nSieg and axiomatic definitions\nAt the \"Feferfest\" – Solomon Feferman's 70th birthday – Wilfried Sieg first presents a paper written two years earlier titled \"Calculations By Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis\", reprinted in (Sieg et al. 2002:390–409). Earlier Sieg published \"Mechanical Procedures and Mathematical Experience\"  (in George 1994, p. 71ff) presenting a history of \"calculability\" beginning  with Richard Dedekind and ending in the 1950s  with the later papers of Alan Turing and Stephen Cole Kleene.  The Feferfest paper distills the prior paper to its major points and dwells primarily on Robin Gandy's paper of 1980. Sieg extends Turing's \"computability by string machine\" (human \"computor\") as reduced to mechanism \"computability by letter machine\"Turing's thesis – cf drawing p. 398 to the parallel machines of Gandy.\n\nSieg cites more recent work including \"Kolmogorov and Uspensky's work on algorithms\" and (De Pisapia 2000), in particular, the KU-pointer machine-model), and artificial neural networksSieig 2002:399 and asserts:\n\"The separation of informal conceptual analysis and mathematical equivalence proof is essential for recognizing that the correctness of Turing's Thesis (taken generically) rests on two pillars; namely on the correctness of boundedness and locality conditions for computors, and on the correctness of the pertinent central thesis. The latter asserts explicitly that computations of a computor can be mimicked directly by a particular kind of machine. However satisfactory one may find this line of analytic argument, there are two weak spots: the looseness of the restrictive conditions (What are symbolic configurations? What changes can mechanical operations effect?) and the corresponding vagueness of the central thesis. We are, no matter how we turn ourselves, in a position that is methodologically still unsatisfactory ... .\"\n\nHe claims to \"step toward a more satisfactory stance ... [by] abstracting further away from particular types of configurations and operations ...\"\n\"It has been claimed frequently that Turing analyzed computations of machines. That is historically and systematically inaccurate, as my exposition should have made quite clear. Only in 1980 did Turing's student, Robin Gandy, characterize machine computations.\"\n\nWhether the above statement is true or not is left to the reader to ponder. Sieg goes on to describe Gandy's analysis (see above 1980). In doing so he attempts to formalize what he calls \"Gandy machines\" (with a detailed analysis in an Appendix). About the Gandy machines:\n\" ... the definition of a Gandy machine is an \"abstract\" mathematical definition that embodies ... properties of parallel computations ... Second, Gandy machines share with groups and topological spaces the general feature of abstract axiomatic definitions, namely, that they admit a wide variety of different interpretations. Third, ... the computations of any Gandy machine can be simulated by a letter machine, [and] is best understood as a representation theorem for the axiomatic notion. [boldface added]\n\n\"The axiomatic approach captures the essential nature of computation processes in an abstract way. The difference between the two types of calculators I have been describing is reduced to the fact that Turing computors modify one bounded part of a state, whereas Gandy machines operate in parallel on arbitrarily many bounded parts. The representation theorems guarantee that models of the axioms are computationally equivalent to Turing machines in their letter variety.\"Sieg 2002:404\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n  Barwise, Jon, H. J.

For example, a machine that could solve the halting problem would be a hypercomputer; so too would one that can correctly evaluate every statement in Peano arithmetic.\n\nThe Church–Turing thesis states that any \"computable\" function that can be computed by a mathematician with a pen and paper using a finite set of simple algorithms, can be computed by a Turing machine. Hypercomputers compute functions that a Turing machine cannot and which are, hence, not computable in the Church–Turing sense.\n\nTechnically the output of a random Turing machine is uncomputable; however, most hypercomputing literature focuses instead on the computation of useful, rather than random, uncomputable functions.\n\nHistory\nA computational model going beyond Turing machines was introduced by Alan Turing in his 1938 PhD dissertation Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals.Alan Turing, 1939, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals Proceedings London Mathematical Society Volumes 2–45, Issue 1, pp. 161–228. This paper investigated mathematical systems in which an oracle was available, which could compute a single arbitrary (non-recursive) function from naturals to naturals. He used this device to prove that even in those more powerful systems, undecidability is still present. Turing's oracle machines are mathematical abstractions, and are not physically realizable.\"Let us suppose that we are supplied with some unspecified means of solving number-theoretic problems; a kind of oracle as it were.

This might require quite bizarre laws of physics (for example, a measurable physical constant with an oracular value, such as Chaitin's constant), and would require the ability to measure the real-valued physical value to arbitrary precision.\nSimilarly, a neural net that somehow had Chaitin's constant exactly embedded in its weight function would be able to solve the halting problem, though constructing such an infinitely precise neural net, even if you somehow know Chaitin's constant beforehand, is impossible under the laws of quantum mechanics.\nCertain fuzzy logic-based \"fuzzy Turing machines\" can, by definition, accidentally solve the halting problem, but only because their ability to solve the halting problem is indirectly assumed in the specification of the machine; this tends to be viewed as a \"bug\" in the original specification of the machines.\nSimilarly, a proposed model known as fair nondeterminism can accidentally allow the oracular computation of noncomputable functions, because some such systems, by definition, have the oracular ability to identify reject inputs that would \"unfairly\" cause a subsystem to run forever.Ord, Toby. \"The many forms of hypercomputation.\" Applied mathematics and computation 178.1 (2006): 143–153.\nDmytro Taranovsky has proposed a finitistic model of traditionally non-finitistic branches of analysis, built around a Turing machine equipped with a rapidly increasing function as its oracle. By this and more complicated models he was able to give an interpretation of second-order arithmetic. These models require an uncomputable input, such as a physical event-generating process where the interval between events grows at an uncomputably large rate.\nSimilarly, one unorthodox interpretation of a model of unbounded nondeterminism posits, by definition, that the length of time required for an \"Actor\" to settle is fundamentally unknowable, and therefore it cannot be proven, within the model, that it does not take an uncomputably long period of time.Hewitt, Carl. \"What Is Commitment.\" Physical, Organizational, and Social (Revised), Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, and Norms in Agent Systems II: AAMAS (2006).\n\n\"Infinite computational steps\" models\nIn order to work correctly, certain computations by the machines below literally require infinite, rather than merely unlimited but finite, physical space and resources; in contrast, with a Turing machine, any given computation that halts will require only finite physical space and resources.\n\nA Turing machine that can complete infinitely many steps in finite time, a feat known as a supertask. Simply being able to run for an unbounded number of steps does not suffice. One mathematical model is the Zeno machine (inspired by Zeno's paradox). The Zeno machine performs its first computation step in (say) 1 minute, the second step in ½ minute, the third step in ¼ minute, etc.  By summing 1+½+¼+... (a geometric series) we see that the machine performs infinitely many steps in a total of 2 minutes. According to Shagrir, Zeno machines introduce physical paradoxes and its state is logically undefined outside of one-side open period of [0, 2), thus undefined exactly at 2 minutes after beginning of the computation.These models have been independently developed by many different authors, including ; the model is discussed in ,  and \n\nIt seems natural that the possibility of time travel (existence of closed timelike curves (CTCs)) makes hypercomputation possible by itself. However, this is not so since a CTC does not provide (by itself) the unbounded amount of storage that an infinite computation would require. Nevertheless, there are spacetimes in which the CTC region can be used for relativistic hypercomputation.Hajnal Andréka, István Németi and Gergely Székely, Closed Timelike Curves in Relativistic Computation Parallel Process. Lett. 22, 1240010 (2012). According to a 1992 paper,Hogarth, M., 1992, 'Does General Relativity Allow an Observer to View an Eternity in a Finite Time?', Foundations of Physics Letters, 5, 173–181. a computer operating in a Malament–Hogarth spacetime or in orbit around a rotating black hole could theoretically perform non-Turing computations.Etesi, G., and Nemeti, I., 2002  'Non-Turing computations via Malament-Hogarth space-times', Int.J.Theor.Phys. 41 (2002) 341–370,  Non-Turing Computations via Malament-Hogarth Space-Times:.Earman, J. and Norton, J., 1993,  'Forever is a Day: Supertasks in Pitowsky and Malament-Hogarth Spacetimes', Philosophy of Science, 5, 22–42. Access to a CTC may allow the rapid solution to PSPACE-complete problems, a complexity class which, while Turing-decidable, is generally considered computationally intractable.Todd A. Brun, Computers with closed timelike curves can solve hard problems, Found.Phys.Lett. 16 (2003) 245–253.S. Aaronson and J. Watrous. Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent \n\nQuantum models\nSome scholars conjecture that a quantum mechanical system which somehow uses an infinite superposition of states could compute a non-computable function.There have been some claims to this effect; see  or  and the ensuing literature. For a retort see  . This is not possible using the standard qubit-model quantum computer, because it is proven that a regular quantum computer is PSPACE-reducible (a quantum computer running in polynomial time can be simulated by a classical computer running in polynomial space).Bernstein and Vazirani, Quantum complexity theory, SIAM Journal on Computing, 26(5):1411–1473, 1997. \n\n\"Eventually correct\" systems\nSome physically-realizable systems will always eventually converge to the correct answer, but have the defect that they will often output an incorrect answer and stick with the incorrect answer for an uncomputably large period of time before eventually going back and correcting the mistake.\n\nIn mid 1960s, E Mark Gold and Hilary Putnam independently proposed models of inductive inference (the \"limiting recursive functionals\",  and \"trial-and-error predicates\", respectively). These models enable some nonrecursive sets of numbers or languages (including all recursively enumerable sets of languages) to be \"learned in the limit\"; whereas, by definition, only recursive sets of numbers or languages could be identified by a Turing machine. While the machine will stabilize to the correct answer on any learnable set in some finite time, it can only identify it as correct if it is recursive; otherwise, the correctness is established only by running the machine forever and noting that it never revises its answer. Putnam identified this new interpretation as the class of \"empirical\" predicates, stating: \"if we always 'posit' that the most recently generated answer is correct, we will make a finite number of mistakes, but we will eventually get the correct answer. (Note, however, that even if we have gotten to the correct answer (the end of the finite sequence) we are never sure that we have the correct answer.)\" L. K. Schubert's 1974 paper \"Iterated Limiting Recursion and the Program Minimization Problem\"  studied the effects of iterating the limiting procedure; this allows any arithmetic predicate to be computed. Schubert wrote, \"Intuitively, iterated limiting identification might be regarded as higher-order inductive inference performed collectively by an ever-growing community of lower order inductive inference machines.\"\nA symbol sequence is computable in the limit if there is a finite, possibly non-halting program on a universal Turing machine that incrementally outputs every symbol of the sequence. This includes the dyadic expansion of π and of every other computable real, but still excludes all noncomputable reals. Traditional Turing machines cannot edit their previous outputs; generalized Turing machines, as defined by Jürgen Schmidhuber, can. He defines the constructively describable symbol sequences as those that have a finite, non-halting program running on a generalized Turing machine, such that any output symbol eventually converges; that is, it does not change any more after some finite initial time interval. Due to limitations first exhibited by Kurt Gödel (1931), it may be impossible to predict the convergence time itself by a halting program, otherwise the halting problem could be solved. Schmidhuber () uses this approach to define the set of formally describable or constructively computable universes or constructive theories of everything. Generalized Turing machines can eventually converge to a correct solution of the halting problem by evaluating a Specker sequence.\n\nAnalysis of capabilities\nMany hypercomputation proposals amount to alternative ways to read an oracle or advice function embedded into an otherwise classical machine. Others allow access to some higher level of the arithmetic hierarchy. For example, supertasking Turing machines, under the usual assumptions, would be able to compute any predicate in the truth-table degree containing  or . Limiting-recursion, by contrast, can compute any predicate or function in the corresponding Turing degree, which is known to be . Gold further showed that limiting partial recursion would allow the computation of precisely the  predicates.\n\n Model Computable predicates Notes Refs supertasking tt() dependent on outside observer  limiting/trial-and-error    iterated limiting (k times)    Blum-Shub-Smale machine   incomparable with traditional computable real functions  Malament-Hogarth spacetime HYP dependent on spacetime structure  analog recurrent neural network  f is an advice function giving connection weights; size is bounded by runtime  infinite time Turing machine  Arithmetical Quasi-Inductive sets   classical fuzzy Turing machine  for any computable t-norm  increasing function oracle  for the one-sequence model;  are r.e. \n\nCriticism\nMartin Davis, in his writings on hypercomputation\nrefers to this subject as \"a myth\" and offers counter-arguments to the\nphysical realizability of hypercomputation.

      "text": "An international auxiliary language (sometimes abbreviated as IAL or auxlang) or interlanguage is a language meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common first language. An auxiliary language is primarily a foreign language.\n\nLanguages of dominant societies over the centuries have served as lingua francas that sometimes approaches the international level. Latin, Greek and the Mediterranean Lingua Franca were used in the past, and (Standard) Arabic, Standard Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish have been used as such in recent times in many parts of the world.Bodmer, Frederick. The loom of language and Pei, Mario. One language for the world.\n\nHowever, as lingua francas are traditionally associated with the very dominance—cultural, political, and economic—that made them popular, they are often also met with resistance. For this and other reasons, some have turned to the idea of promoting an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution, by way of \"auxiliary\" language. The term \"auxiliary\" implies that it is intended to be an additional language for the people of the world, rather than to replace their native languages. Often, the term is used to refer to planned or constructed languages proposed specifically to ease international communication, such as Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua. However, it can also refer to the concept of such a language being determined by international consensus, including even a standardized natural language (e.g., International English), and has also been connected to the project of constructing a universal language.\n\n History \n\nThe use of an intermediary auxiliary language (also called a \"working language\", \"bridge language\", \"vehicular language\" or \"unifying language\") to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues,Viacheslav A. Chirikba, \"The problem of the Caucasian Sprachbund\" in Pieter Muysken, ed., From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics, 2008, p. 31.  may be almost as old as language itself. Certainly they have existed since antiquity. Latin and Greek (or Koiné Greek) were the intermediary language of all areas of the Mediterraneum; Akkadian, and then Aramaic, remained the common languages of a large part of Western Asia through several earlier empires.Ostler, 2005 pp. 38–40 Such natural languages used for communication between people not sharing the same mother tongue are called lingua francas.\n\nNatural international languages: Lingua francas\nLingua francas have arisen around the globe throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called \"trade languages\") but also for diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities. The term originates with one such language, Mediterranean Lingua Franca, a pidgin language used as a trade language in the Mediterranean area from the 11th to the 19th century. Examples of lingua francas remain numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious example as of the early 21st century is English. There are many other lingua francas centralized on particular regions, such as Arabic, Chinese, French, Greek, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.\n\nConstructed languages\n\nSince all natural languages display a number of irregularities in grammar which makes them more difficult to learn, and they are also associated with the national and cultural dominance of the nation that speaks it as its mother tongue, attention began to focus on the idea of creating an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution. The concept of simplifying an existing language to make it an auxiliary language was already in the Encyclopédie of the 18th century, where Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve, in the article on Langue, wrote a short proposition of a \"laconic\" or regularized grammar of French.\n\nSome of the philosophical languages of the 17th–18th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages as well as to disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as can be told from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages we know of, as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; Solresol by François Sudre (1787–1862), a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.\n\nVolapük\n\nDuring the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such constructed international auxiliary languages (IALs) were proposed, so Louis Couturat and Léopold Leau in Histoire de la langue universelle (1903) reviewed 38 projects.\n\nVolapük, first described in an article in 1879 by Johann Martin Schleyer and in book form the following year, was the first to garner a widespread international speaker community. Three major Volapük conventions were held, in 1884, 1887, and 1889; the last of them used Volapük as its working language. André Cherpillod writes of the third Volapük convention,\nHowever, not long after, the Volapük speaker community broke up due to various factors including controversies between Schleyer and other prominent Volapük speakers, and the appearance of newer, easier-to-learn constructed languages, primarily Esperanto.\n\nFrom Kadem bevünetik volapüka to Academia pro Interlingua\n\nAnswering the needs of the first successful artificial language community, the Volapükists established the regulatory body of their language, under the name International Volapük Academy (Kadem bevünetik volapüka) at the second Volapük congress in Munich in August 1887.Schmidt, Johann. 1964. Jenotem valemapüka Volapük. Amsterdam: Volapükagased.Schmidt, Johann. 1996. Historio de la universala lingvo Volapuko. Translator: Philippe Combot. Courgenard: La Blanchetière.  The Academy was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language Volapük, but soon conflicts arose between conservative Volapükists and those who wanted to reform Volapük to make it a more naturalistic language based on the grammar and vocabulary of major world languages. In 1890 Schleyer himself left the original Academy and created a new Volapük Academy with the same name, from people completely loyal to him, which continues to this day.\n\nUnder Waldemar Rosenberger, who became the director in 1892, the original Academy began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volapük. The vocabulary and the grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were completely discarded, so that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named \"Idiom Neutral\". The name of the Academy was changed to Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.\n\nIn 1903, the mathematician Giuseppe Peano published his completely new approach to language construction. Inspired by the idea of philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, instead of inventing schematic structures and a priori language, he chose to simplify an existing and once widely used international language, Latin. This simplified Latin, devoid of inflections and declensions, was named Interlingua by Peano but is usually referred to as \"Latino sine flexione\".\n\nImpressed by Peano's Interlingua, the Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal effectively chose to abandon Idiom Neutral in favor of Peano's Interlingua in 1908, and it elected Peano as its director. The name of the group then was changed to Academia pro Interlingua (where Interlingua stands for Peano's language). The Academia pro Interlingua survived until about 1939. It was partly Peano's Interlingua that inspired the better-known Interlingua presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).\n\nEsperanto\n\nAfter the emergence of Volapük, a wide variety of other auxiliary languages were devised and proposed in the 1880s–1900s, but none except Esperanto gathered a significant speaker community. Esperanto was developed from about 1873–1887 (a first version was ready in 1878), and finally published in 1887, by L. L. Zamenhof, as a primarily schematic language; the word-stems are borrowed from Romance, West Germanic and Slavic languages. The key to the relative success of Esperanto was probably the highly productive and elastic system of derivational word formation which allowed speakers to derive hundreds of other words by learning one word root. Moreover, Esperanto is quicker to learn than other languages, usually in a third up to a fifth of the time. From early on, Esperantists created their own culture which helped to form the Esperanto language community.\n\nWithin a few years this language had thousands of fluent speakers, primarily in eastern Europe. In 1905 its first world convention was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Esperanto has become \"the most outlandishly successful invented language ever\" and the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language. Esperanto is probably between the fifty languages which are most used internationally.See e. g. Gregory Grefenstette, Julien Nioche. Estimation of English and non-English Language Use on the WWW. 2000 (Esperanto ranks #27 among languages using the Latin alphabet). The Esperanto Wikipedia is #32 among the language  Wikipedia s.\n\nIn 1922 a proposal by Iran and several other countries in the League of Nations to have Esperanto taught in member nations' schools failed.Le Défi des Langues by Claude Piron, L'Harmattan 1994.The Esperanto Book, Chapter 7: History in Fine  by Don Harlow. 1995. Esperanto speakers were subject to persecution under Stalin's regime. In Germany under Hitler, in Spain under Franco for about a decade, in Portugal under Salazar, in Romania under Ceaucescu, and in half a dozen Eastern European countries during the late forties and part of the fifties, Esperanto activities and the formation of Esperanto associations were forbidden.Lins, Ulrich. La Danĝera Lingvo. Gerlingen, Germany: Bleicher Eldonejo, 1988. In spite of these factors more people continued to learn Esperanto, and significant literary work (both poetry and novels) appeared in Esperanto in the period between the World Wars and after them.The Esperanto Book, Chapter 9: \"The Literary Scene\"  by Don Harlow. 1995. Esperanto is spoken today in a growing number of countries and it has multiple generations of native speakers, although it is primarily used as a second language. Of the various constructed language projects, it is Esperanto that has so far come closest to becoming an officially recognized international auxiliary language; China publishes daily news in Esperanto.china.org.cn\n\nIdo and the Esperantidos\n\nThe Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language was founded in 1900 by Louis Couturat and others; it tried to get the International Association of Academies to take up the question of an international auxiliary language, study the existing ones and pick one or design a new one. However, the meta-academy declining to do so, the Delegation decided to do the job itself.Otto Jesperson, An International Language.  \"The Delegation. Ido.\" 1928. Among Esperanto speakers there was a general impression that the Delegation would of course choose Esperanto, as it was the only auxlang with a sizable speaker community at the time; it was felt as a betrayal by many Esperanto speakers when in 1907 the Delegation came up with its own reformed version of Esperanto, Ido.Harlow, Don. The Esperanto Book, chapter 3: \"How to Build a Language\" . Ido drew a significant number of speakers away from Esperanto in the short term, but in the longer term most of these either returned to Esperanto or moved on to other new auxlangs. Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called Esperantidos, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the three most widely spoken auxlangs.\n\nOccidental (Interlingue) and Novial\n\nEdgar von Wahl's Occidental (also called \"Interlingue\") of 1922 was in reaction against the perceived artificiality of some earlier auxlangs, particularly Esperanto. Inspired by Idiom Neutral and Peano's Interlingua, von Wahl created a language whose words, including compound words, would have a high degree of recognizability for those who already know a Romance language. However, this design criterion was in conflict with the ease of coining new compound or derived words on the fly while speaking. Occidental gained a small speaker community in the 1920s and 1930s, and supported several publications, but had almost entirely died out by the 1980s. More recently Occidental has been revived on the Internet.\n\nIn 1928 Ido's major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, abandoned Ido, and published his own planned language, Novial. It was mostly inspired by Idiom Neutral and Occidental, yet it attempted a derivational formalism and schematism sought by Esperanto and Ido. The notability of its creator helped the growth of this auxiliary language, but soon both Novial and Occidental were abandoned in favour of Interlingua, the first auxiliary language based fully on scientific methodology.\n\nInterlingua\n\nThe International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) was founded in 1924 by Alice Vanderbilt Morris; like the earlier Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language, its mission was to study language problems and the existing auxlangs and proposals for auxlangs, and to negotiate some consensus between the supporters of various auxlangs. However, like the Delegation, it finally decided to create its own auxlang. Interlingua, published in 1951, was primarily the work of Alexander Gode, though he built on preliminary work by earlier IALA linguists including André Martinet, and relied on elements from previous naturalistic auxlang projects, like Peano's Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Jespersen's Novial, von Walh's Occidental (Interlingue), and the Academy's Idiom Neutral. Like Occidental, Interlingua was designed to have words recognizable at sight by those who already know a Romance language or a language like English with much vocabulary borrowed from Romance languages; to attain this end the IALA accepted a degree of grammatical and orthographic complexity considerably greater than in Esperanto or Occidental, though still less than in any natural language.\n\nThe theory underlying Interlingua posits an international vocabulary, a large number of words and affixes that are present in a wide range of languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to \"all corners of the world\". The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred.Words appearing in only a few, closely related languages were ignored. See Gode, Alexander, Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company. They conducted studies to identify \"the most generally international vocabulary possible\", while still maintaining the unity of the language.Gode, Alexander, Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company (p. xxii). This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called control languages) resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that can be called the highest common factor of each major European language.\n\nInterlingua gained a significant speaker community, perhaps roughly the same size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua's success can be explained by the fact that it is the most widely understood international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.Blandino, Giovanni, \"Le problema del linguas international auxiliari\", Philosophia del Cognoscentia e del Scientia, Rome, Italy: Pontificia Universitas Lateranensis, Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, 1989. Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.\"Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua,\" Panorama in Interlingua, Issue 3, 2006.\n\nAfter the creation of Interlingua, there were no more successful attempts in international language engineering that would attract a significant number of supporters, thus the enthusiasm about constructed languages gradually decreased in the years between 1960–1990.\n\nInternet age\nAll of the auxlangs with a surviving speaker community seem to have benefited from the advent of the Internet, Esperanto more than most. The CONLANG mailing list was founded in 1991; in its early years discussion focused on international auxiliary languages. As people interested in artistic languages and engineered languages grew to be the majority of the list members, and flame-wars between proponents of particular auxlangs irritated these members, a separate AUXLANG mailing list was created in 1997, which has been the primary venue for discussion of auxlangs since then.  Besides giving the existing auxlangs with speaker communities a chance to interact rapidly online as well as slowly through postal mail or more rarely in personal meetings, the Internet has also made it easier to publicize new auxlang projects, and a handful of these have gained a small speaker community, including Kotava, Lingua Franca Nova, Lingwa de Planeta, Pandunia, Sambahsa, and Toki Pona.Although Toki Pona was not intended by its creator as an auxlang, it has been used for communication between people of different native languages far more often than most of the thousands of auxlang proposals throughout history.\n\nZonal constructed languages\n\nNot every international auxiliary language is necessarily intended to be used on a global scale. A special subgroup are languages created to facilitate communication between speakers of a certain group of related languages. The oldest known example is a Pan-Slavic language written in 1665 by the Croatian priest Juraj Križanić. He named this language Ruski (\"Russian\"), but in reality it was a mixture of the Russian edition of Church Slavonic, his own Southern Chakavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian, and, to a lesser degree, Polish.\n\nMost zonal constructed languages were created during the period of romantic nationalism at the end of the 19th century; some were created later. Particularly numerous are the Pan-Slavic languages. However, similar efforts have been made at creating umbrella languages for other language families as well: Tutonish (1902) and Folkspraak (1995) for the Germanic languages, Romanid (1956) for the Romance languages, and Afrihili (1973) for the African continent.\n\nNowadays, most older zonal constructed languages are known only to specialists. Most notable among modern examples is Interslavic, a project established in 2011 after the merger of several other projects. In 2012 it was reported to have several hundred users.G. Iliev, Short History of the Cyrillic Alphabet (Plovdiv, 2012), p. 67. HTML version\n\n Scholarly study \n\nIn the early 1900s auxlangs were already becoming a subject of academic study.  Louis Couturat et al.L. Couturat, O. Jespersen, R. Lorenz, W.Ostwalkd and L.Pfaundler. International Language and Science: Considerations on the Introduction of an International Language into Science. 1910. described the controversy in the preface to their book International Language and Science:\n\nThe question of a so-called world-language, or better expressed, an international auxiliary language, was during the now past Volapük period, and is still in the present Esperanto movement, so much in the hands of Utopians, fanatics and enthusiasts, that it is difficult to form an unbiased opinion concerning it, although a good idea lies at its basis. (1910, p. v). \n\nLeopold Pfaundler wrote that an IAL was needed for more effective communication among scientists:\n\nAll who are occupied with the reading or writing of scientific literature have assuredly very often felt the want of a common scientific language, and regretted the great loss of time and trouble caused by the multiplicity of languages employed in scientific literature.\n\nFor Couturat et al., Volapukists and Esperantists confounded the linguistic aspect of the question with many side issues, and they considered this a main reason why discussion about the idea of an international auxiliary language has appeared unpractical.\n\nSome contemporaries of Couturat, notably Edward SapirSapir, Edward (1931). \"The function of an international auxiliary language\". Romanic Review (11): 4–15.Sapir, Edward (1925). \"Memorandum on the problem of an international auxiliary language\". The Romanic Review (16): 244–256 saw the challenge of an auxiliary language not as much as that of identifying a descriptive linguistic answer (of grammar and vocabulary) to global communicative concerns, but rather as one of promoting the notion of a linguistic platform for lasting international understanding. Though interest among scholars, and linguists in particular, waned greatly throughout the 20th century,Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 2015.

Yet others argue in favor of a particular language while seeking to establish its social integration.e.g. Fettes, Mark (1997). Esperanto and language policy: Exploring the issues. Journal of Language Problems and Language Planning 21, 66-77\n\nWriting systems\nSeveral IAL use the Latin script, some of them like LFN also offer an alternative in the Cyrillic script.\n\nLatin script\nThe vast majority of IALs use the Latin script. Several sounds, e.g. /n/, /m/, /t/, /f/ are written with the same letter as in IPA.\n\nSome consonant sounds found in several Latin-script IAL alphabets are not represented by an ISO 646 letter in IPA. Three have a single letter in IPA, one has a widespread alternative taken from ISO 646:\n /ʃ/ (U+0283, IPA 134)\n /ʒ/ (U+0292, IPA 135)\n /ɡ/ (U+0261, IPA 110, single storey g) = g (U+0067, double storey g)\nFour are affricates, each represented in IPA by two letters and a combining marker. They are often written decomposed:\n /t͡s/ = /ts/\n /t͡ʃ/ = /tʃ/; Note: Polish distinguishes between them\n /d͡z/ = /dz/\n /d͡ʒ/ = /dʒ/\n\nThat means that two sounds that are one character in IPA and are not ISO 646, also have no common alternative in ISO 646: ʃ, ʒ.\n\n ISO 639-3 code Alphabet name Non ISO 646 letters Diacritics Multigraphs Sound, which in IPA is described by ISO 646 letter(s), is described by different letter(s) Sound, which in IPA is described by non-ISO 646 letter(s), is described by different letter(s) lfn Lingua Franca Nova No No No Yes (c /k/) Yes (j /ʒ/, x /ʃ/) rmv Romanova No No No Yes (c /k/) Yes (j /ʃ/) ina Interlingua No No Yes (qu /kw/ or /k/) Yes (c /k/) No ido Ido No No Yes (ch /tʃ/, qu /kw/, sh /ʃ/) Yes (c /ts/, q /k/, x /ks/ or /ɡz/) Yes (j /ʒ/, sh /ʃ/) nov Novial No No Yes (ch /tʃ/, sh /ʃ/, y /j/) Yes (q /k/, x /ks/) Yes (j /ʒ/, sh /ʃ/) igs Interglossa No No Yes (ph, th, ch, rh -> /f/, /t/, /k/, /r/) Yes (c /k/, q /k/, x /ks/, z /ts/) No epo Esperanto No Yes (ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, ŭ) No Yes (c /ts/) No - Mundolinco No No No Yes (c /k/) No - Glosa No No Yes (sc /ʃ/) Yes (q /kw/, x /ks/) Yes (c /tʃ/, sc /ʃ/) - Sambahsa\"Sambahsa pronounciation  in English\" No No Yes (ch /tʃ/, sh /ʃ/, and more) Yes (y, as a semi-vowel /j/, x /ks, gz/ and more) Yes (j /ʒ/, ch /tʃ/, sh /ʃ/, sh /ç/ and more) - Idiom Neutral No No Yes (sh /ʃ/) Yes (y /j/) Yes (c /tʃ/, j /ʒ/, sh /ʃ/) - Lingwa de planeta No No Yes (ch /tʃ/, sh /ʃ/) Yes (x /gs/, z /dz/) Yes (c in ch /tʃ/, j /dʒ/) - Interslavic No Yes (č, ě, š, ž) dž, but similar to or same as d+ž Yes (c /ts/, y /i ~ ɪ/) Yes (č /tʃ/, š /ʃ/, ž /ʒ/) - Uropi Yes (ʒ /ʒ/) No No No Yes (c /ʃ/) - Novbasa No No Yes (c /tʃ/, x /ʃ/) Yes (x /ʃ/) No\n\nClassification\n\nThe following classification of auxiliary languages was developed by Pierre Janton in 1993:Pierre Janton, Esperanto: Language, Literature, and Community. Translated by Humphrey Tonkin et al.  State University of New York Press, 1993. .\n\n A priori languages are characterized by largely artificial morphemes (not borrowed from natural languages), schematic derivation, simple phonology, grammar and morphology. Some a priori languages are called philosophical languages, referring to their basis in philosophical ideas about thought and language. These include some of the earliest efforts at auxiliary language in the 17th century. Some more specific subcategories:\n Oligosynthetic or oligoisolating languages have no more than a few hundred morphemes. Most of their vocabulary is made of compound words or set phrases formed from these morphemes. Sona and Toki Pona are well known examples, although Toki Pona's word stock is mostly based on other languages and therefore not a priori.\n Taxonomic languages form their words using a taxonomic hierarchy, with each phoneme of a word helping specify its position in a semantic hierarchy of some kind; for example, Solresol and Ro.\n Pasigraphies are purely written languages without a spoken form, or with a spoken form left at the discretion of the reader; many of the 17th–18th century philosophical languages and auxlangs were pasigraphies.  This set historically tends to overlap with taxonomic languages, though there is no inherent reason a pasigraphy needs to be taxonomic.\n Logical languages such as Lojban and its predecessor, Loglan, aim to eliminate ambiguity. Both these examples, it should be noted, derive their morphemes from a broad range of natural languages using statistical methods.\n A posteriori languages are based on existing natural languages. Nearly all the auxiliary languages with fluent speakers are in this category. Most of the a posteriori auxiliary languages borrow their vocabulary primarily or solely from European languages, and base their grammar more or less on European models. (Sometimes these European-based languages are referred to as \"euroclones\", although this term has negative connotations and is not used in the academic literature.) Interlingua was drawn originally from international scientific vocabulary, in turn based primarily on Greek and Latin roots. Glosa did likewise, with a stronger dependence of Greek roots. Although a posteriori languages have been based on most of the families of European languages, the most successful of these (notably Esperanto,http://failuremag.com/feature/article/discouraging_words/ Ido and Interlingua) have been based largely on Romance elements.\n Schematic (or \"mixed\") languages have some a priori qualities.  Some have ethnic morphemes but alter them significantly to fit a simplified phonotactic pattern (e.g., Volapük, Toki Pona) or both artificial and natural morphemes (e.g., Perio). Partly schematic languages have partly schematic and partly naturalistic derivation (e.g. Esperanto and Ido). Natural morphemes of languages in this group are rarely altered greatly from their source-language form, but compound and derived words are generally not recognizable at sight by people familiar with the source languages.\n Naturalistic languages resemble existing natural languages.  For example, Occidental, Interlingua, and Lingua Franca Nova were developed so that not only the root words but their compounds and derivations will often be recognizable immediately by large numbers of people. Some naturalistic languages do have a limited number of artificial morphemes or invented grammatical devices (e.g. Novial). (Note that the term \"naturalistic\" as used in auxiliary language scholarship does not mean the same thing as the homophonous term used in describing artistic languages.\"Re: \"Naturalistic\" for auxlangers vs artlangers?\"  AUXLANG mailing list post by Jörg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009)\n Simplified natural languages reduce the full extent of vocabulary and partially regularize the grammar of a natural language (e.g. Basic English, Special English and Globish).\n\nComparison of sample texts\n\nSome examples of the best known international auxiliary languages are shown below for comparative purposes. As a reference for comparison, you can find the Latin, English, French, and Spanish versions of the Lord's Prayer (a text which is regularly used for linguistic comparisons) here:\nLatin versionEnglish version (KJV)French versionSpanish versionPater noster, qui es in cælis,\nsanctificetur nomen tuum.\nAdveniat regnum tuum.\nFiat voluntas tua,\nsicut in cælo, et in terra.\nPanem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie,\net dimitte nobis debita nostra,\nsicut et nos dimittimus \ndebitoribus nostris.\nEt ne nos inducas in tentationem,\nsed libera nos a malo.\nAmen.Our Father, who art in heaven,\nhallowed be thy name;\nthy kingdom come,\nthy will be done.\non earth, as it is in heaven.\nGive us this day our daily bread;\nand forgive us our debts\nas we have forgiven \nour debtors.\nAnd lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from evil.\nAmen.Notre Père, qui es aux cieux,\nque ton nom soit sanctifié,\nque ton règne vienne,\nque ta volonté soit faite \nsur la terre comme au ciel.\nDonne-nous aujourd’hui notre pain de ce jour.\nPardonne-nous nos offenses,\ncomme nous pardonnons aussi\nà ceux qui nous ont offensés.\nEt ne nous laisse pas entrer en tentation\nmais délivre-nous du Mal.\nAmen.Padre nuestro, que estás en los cielos,\nsantificado sea tu nombre;\nvenga a nosotros tu reino;\nhágase tu voluntad\nasí en la Tierra como en el cielo.\nEl pan nuestro de cada día dánosle hoy;\ny perdónanos nuestras deudas\nasí como nosotros perdonamos\na nuestros deudores;\nno nos dejes caer en la tentación,\nmas líbranos del mal.\nAmén.\n\nSchematic languages\nVolapük versionEsperanto versionIdo versionIdiom Neutral versionO Fat obas, kel binol in süls,\npaisaludomöz nem ola!\nKömomöd monargän ola!\nJenomöz vil olik,\näs in sül, i su tal!\nBodi obsik vädeliki givolös obes adelo!\nE pardolös obes debis obsik,\näs id obs aipardobs debeles obas.\nE no obis nindukolös in tentadi;\nsod aidalivolös obis de bad.\nJenosöd!Patro Nia, kiu estas en la ĉielo, \nvia nomo estu sanktigita. \nVenu via regno, \nplenumiĝu via volo, \nkiel en la ĉielo, tiel ankaŭ sur la tero. \nNian panon ĉiutagan donu al ni hodiaŭ. \nKaj pardonu al ni niajn ŝuldojn, \nkiel ankaŭ ni pardonas al niaj ŝuldantoj. \nKaj ne konduku nin en tenton, \nsed liberigu nin de la malbono.\nAmen.Patro nia, qua esas en la cielo,\ntua nomo santigesez;\ntua regno advenez;\ntua volo facesez\nquale en la cielo, tale anke sur la tero.\nDonez a ni cadie l'omnadiala pano,\ne pardonez a ni nia ofensi,\nquale anke ni pardonas a nia ofensanti,\ne ne duktez ni aden la tento,\nma liberigez ni del malajo.\nAmen.Nostr patr kel es in sieli!\nKe votr nom es sanktifiked;

This approach is taken in the belief that one language will eventually and inevitably \"win out\" as a world auxiliary language (e.g. International English) without any need for specific action.\n Institutional sponsorship and grass-roots promotion of language programs. This approach has taken various forms, depending on the language and language type, ranging from government promotion of a particular language to one-on-one encouragement to learn the language to instructional or marketing programs.\n National legislation. This approach seeks to have individual countries (or even localities) progressively endorse a given language as an official language (or to promote the concept of international legislation).\n International legislation. This approach involves promotion of the future holding of a binding international convention (perhaps to be under the auspices of such international organizations as the United Nations or Inter-Parliamentary Union) to formally agree upon an official international auxiliary language which would then be taught in all schools around the world, beginning at the primary level. This approach, an official principle of the Baha'i Faith, seeks to put a combination of international opinion, linguistic expertise, and law behind a to-be-selected language and thus expand or consolidate it as a full official world language, to be used in addition to local languages.See an edited compilation of excerpts from the Bahá'í writings regarding the principle of International or Universal Auxiliary Language: The Greatest Instrument for Promoting Harmony and Civilization: Excerpts from the Bahá'í Writings and Related Sources on the Question of an International Auxiliary Language. Gregory Paul Meyjes, ed. Oxford: George Ronald. 2015.  This approach could either give more credibility to a natural language already serving this purpose to a certain degree (e.g. if English were chosen) or to give a greatly enhanced chance for a constructed language to take root. For constructed languages particularly, this approach has been seen by various individuals in the IAL movement as holding the most promise of ensuring that promotion of studies in the language would not be met with skepticism at its practicality by its would-be learners.\n\nPictorial languages\n\nThere have been a number of proposals for using pictures, ideograms, diagrams, and other pictorial representations for international communications. Examples range from the original Characteristica Universalis proposed by the philosopher Leibniz, to suggestions for the adoption of Chinese writing, to recent inventions such as Blissymbol.Charles Keisel Bliss, Semantography (Blissymbolics)\n\nWithin the scientific community, there is already considerable agreement in the form of the schematics used to represent electronic circuits, chemical symbols, mathematical symbols, and the Energy Systems Language of systems ecology. We can also see the international efforts at regularizing symbols used to regulate traffic, to indicate resources for tourists, and in maps. Some symbols have become nearly universal through their consistent use in computers and on the internet.\n\nSign languages\n\nAn international auxiliary sign language has been developed by deaf people who meet regularly at international forums such as sporting events or in political organisations. Previously referred to as GestunoRubino, F., Hayhurst, A., and Guejlman, J., Gestuno: International sign language of the deaf. but now more commonly known simply as 'international sign', the language has continued to develop since the first signs were standardised in 1973, and it is now in widespread use. International sign is distinct in many ways from spoken IALs; many signs are iconic and signers tend to insert these signs into the grammar of their own sign language, with an emphasis on visually intuitive gestures and mime. A simple sign language called Plains Indian Sign Language was used by indigenous peoples of the Americas.\n\nGestuno is not to be confused with the separate and unrelated sign language Signuno, which is essentially a Signed Exact Esperanto. Signuno is not in any significant use, and is based on the Esperanto community rather than based on the international Deaf community.\n\nCriticism\n\nThere has been considerable criticism of international auxiliary languages, both in terms of individual proposals, types of proposals, and in more general terms.\n\nCriticisms directed against Esperanto and other early auxiliary languages in the late 19th century included the idea that different races have sufficiently different speech organs that an international language might work locally in Europe, but hardly worldwide, and the prediction that if adopted, such an auxlang would rapidly break up into local dialects.\"Esenco kaj Estonteco de la Ideo de Lingvo Internacia\", L. L. Zamenhof, 1900.  Reprinted in Fundamenta Krestomatio, 1992 [1903]. Advances in linguistics have done away with the first of these, and the limited but significant use of Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua on an international scale, without breakup into unintelligible dialects, has shown that either a rapid break-up into dialects shall not happen too soon in the future, or that there is enough constant 'standardisation' to reduce the diversity of the language. Subsequently, much criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of these auxlangs, or on the argumentativeness of auxlang proponents and their failure to agree on one auxlang, or even on objective criteria by which to judge auxlangs.\"Farewell to auxiliary languages\" , by Richard K. Harrison. 1997.  However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs and work well enough for that purpose.\n\nOne criticism already prevalent in the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard today, is that an international language might hasten the extinction of minority languages. One response has been that, even if this happens, the benefits would outweigh the costs;.\"Ĉu Zamenhof Pravis?\", Vinko Ošlak, Fonto, februaro 2005. Another response has been that proponents of auxlangs, particularly in the Esperanto movement, are often thought to also be proponents of measures to conserve and promote minority languages and cultures. Based on Baha'i writ, Meyjes (2006) sees an International Auxiliary Language intended to be implemented in ways that shield native tongues from undue pressures from any traditional lingua franca, while enabling inter-community communication worldwide Also see \"universalization\" in Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 1999. Language and Universalization: An Ecolinguistic Reading of Bahá’í writ. The Journal of Bahá’í Studies, 9 (1): 51- 63. Toronto: Association for Bahá’í Studies (Canada); in German: 2003. Sprache und Universalisierung: \"Sprachökologie\" im Bahá'í Schrifttum. Schriftenreihe des Gesellschaft für Bahá'í Studien. Vol. 7. Hofheim (Ts.): Bahá’í Verlag. 129-146\n\nAlthough referred to as international languages, most of these languages have historically been constructed on the basis of Western European languages.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was common for Volapük and Esperanto, and to some extent Ido, to be criticized for not being Western European enough; Occidental and Interlingua were (among other things) responses to this kind of criticism. More recently all these major auxlangs have been criticized for being too European and not global enough.\"Types of neutrality, and central concerns for an IAL\".  AUXLANG mailing list post by Risto Kupsala, 2 December 2005.  One response to this criticism has been that doing otherwise in no way makes the language easier for anyone, while drawing away from the sources of much international vocabulary, technical and popular.Alexander Gode, quoted by Mario Pei in One language for the world (1958).  Another response, primarily from Esperanto speakers, is that the internationality of a language has more to do with the culture of its speakers than with its linguistic properties. Esperanto itself uses individual words from Indo-European languages, but its grammar is much more similar to Chinese and Greek, (while being flexible enough in grammar and sentence structure to be able to copy the word-order of Japanese, Indonesian and English all about as well as each other) so it's difficult to judge how much of an Indo-European language it even is.  The term \"Euroclone\" was coined to refer to these languages in contrast to \"worldlangs\" with global vocabulary sources; the term is sometimes applied only to self-proclaimed \"naturalistic\" auxlangs such as Occidental and Interlingua, sometimes to all auxlangs with primarily European vocabulary sources, regardless of their grammar, including Esperanto and Lingua Franca Nova.\n\nThe response to this argument was made by Alexander GodeGode, Alexander, et al. Interlingua-English: a dictionary of the international language. Storm Publishers, New York, 1951. and reiterated by Mario Pei:Pei, Mario. One Language for the World. N.Y.: Devin-Adair, 1958: A vocabulary selected from a broad variety of languages does not make the language any easier for speakers of any one language. Gode's example compares a paragraph in Interlingua with a paragraph with words from Chinese, Japanese, Malay, and other non-European languages. The first, he argues, should be understood by those familiar with the Romance languages, and not overly difficult for most English speakers:\n\nLa sol dice: \"io me appella sol. Io es multo brillante. Io me leva al est, e cuando io me leva, il es die. Io reguarda per tu fenestra con mi oculo brillante como le auro, e io te dice quando il es tempore a levar te. E io te dice: 'Pigro, leva te. Io non brilla a fin que tu resta al lecto a dormir, sed que tu lege e que tu te promena.'\"\n\nThe second, in contrast, should not only be difficult for speakers of European languages, but Malay speakers likely will not understand the Chinese words, Chinese speakers will likely not understand the Japanese words, and Japanese speakers likely will not understand the Malay words:\n\nMata-hari yu: \"Wo-ti nama mata-hari. Wo taihen brillante. Wo leva wo a est, dan toki wo leva wo, ada hari. Wo miru per ni-ti fenestra sama wo-ti mata brillante como kin, dan wo yu ni toki ada tempo a levar ni. Dan wo yu ni: 'Sust, leva ni. Wo non brilla sam-rap ni tomaru a toko a nemuru, sed wo brilla sam-rap ni leva ni, dan que ni suru kam, ni yomu, dan ni aruku.'\"\n\nAn a priori vocabulary such as that of Spokil or Kotava, or a vocabulary constructed mathematically, such as that of Loglan or Lojban, would likely be as comprehensible.\n\nGode argues, additionally, that the western languages are the unofficial languages of international science, medicine, and technology, and therefore an IAL based on them provides the best access to that literature. Nevertheless, it must be said that a more neutral vocabulary, perhaps even an a priori one, would be less offensive to some non-Europeans.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, many proposals for auxlangs based on global sources of vocabulary and grammar have been made, but most (like the majority of the European-based auxlangs of earlier decades) remain sketches too incomplete to be speakable, and of the more complete ones, few have gained any speakers.  More recently there has been a trend, on the AUXLANG mailing list and on the more recently founded worldlang mailing list, to greater collaboration between various proponents of a more globally based auxlang.\n\nSee also\n\nSee  for a list of designed international auxiliary languages.\n Interlinguistics\n International Language Review\n Language education\n Language planning\n Lingua franca\n Living Latin\n Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language\n Zonal constructed languages\n Global language system\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography\n\n Bliss, Charles Keisel.

      "text": "The Italians ( ) are a Romance ethnic group and nation native to the Italian peninsula and its neighbouring insular territories. Most Italians share a common culture, history, ancestry or language.Miti e simboli della rivoluzione nazionale. Treccani.itEthnic and Cultural Diversity by Country, James D. Fearon. Department of Political Science, Stanford University: The usage of Italian language, dialects and other languages in Italy. Istat.itGiuliano Procacci (ed.) (2009) Storia degli Italiani (In Italian: History of the Italian People). Rome, Italy: Editori Laterza. Legally, all Italian nationals are citizens of the Italian Republic, regardless of ancestry or nation of residence (in effect, however, Italian nationality is largely based on jus sanguinis) and may be distinguished from people of Italian descent without Italian citizenship and from ethnic Italians living in territories adjacent to the Italian Peninsula without Italian citizenship.Ruggiero Romano, Corrado Vivanti, (1972). 'I caratteri originali'. In: Giulio Einaudi Editore (ed), Storia d'Italia Einaudi. 1st ed. Torino: Einaudi. pp.958–959. The majority of Italian nationals are speakers of Italian, or a regional variety thereof. However, many of them also speak another regional or minority language native to Italy; although there is disagreement on the total number, according to UNESCO there are approximately 30 languages native to Italy (often misleadingly referred to as \"Italian dialects\").\n\nIn 2017, in addition to about 55 million Italians in Italy (91% of the Italian national population), Italian-speaking autonomous groups are found in neighbouring nations: almost a quarter million are in Switzerland, a large population is in France, the entire population of San Marino, and there are smaller groups in Slovenia and Croatia, primarily in Istria (Istrian Italians) and Dalmatia (Dalmatian Italians). Because of the wide-ranging diaspora, about 5 million Italian citizens and nearly 80 million people of full or partial Italian ancestry live outside their own homeland, which include the 62.5% of Argentina's population  (Italian Argentines), 1/3 of Uruguayans (Italian Uruguayans),  40% of Paraguayans (Italian Paraguayans), 15% of Brazilians (Italian Brazilians, the largest Italian community outside Italy), and people in other parts of Europe bordering Italy, the Americas (such as Italian Americans, Italian Canadians and Italo-Venezuelans among others), Australasia (Italian Australians and Italian New Zealanders), and the Middle East.\n\nItalians have greatly influenced and contributed to diverse fields, notably the arts and music, science and technology, fashion, cuisine, sports, jurisprudence, banking and business both abroad and worldwide. Furthermore, Italian people are generally known for their localism, both regionalist and municipalist.\n\nName\n\nThe Latin name ItaliaOLD, p. 974: \"first syll. naturally short (cf. Quint.Inst.1.5.18), and so scanned in Lucil.825, but in dactylic verse lengthened metri gratia.\"  according to Strabo's Geographica was used by Greeks to indicate the southwestern tip of the Italian peninsula, corresponding roughly to the current region of Calabria, from  the strait of Messina to the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto.\nIt most likely originates with Oscan Víteliú, meaning \"land of young cattle\" (cf. Latin vitulus \"calf\", Umbrian vitlo \"calf\").J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams, Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture (London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997), 24.  The bull was a symbol of the southern Italic tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the Social War.  \nThe name was later extended to include all the Italian peninsula south of the  Rubicon, and still later, by the end of the 1st century BC, to all of the peninsula and beyond (including Istria, Gallia Cisalpina, Raetia and the islands of Sicily, Malta, Sardinia and Corsica).\n\nLatin Italicus as a substantive meaning \"a man of Italy\" is first recorded in Pliny the Elder, Letters 9.23 (Italicus es an provincialis \"are you an Italian or a provincial?\", referring to the extension of Roman citizenship to all of Italia after 88 BC). \nThe adjective italianus, from which are derived the Italian (and also French and English) name of the Italians is medieval.ytaliiens (1265) TLFi\n\nHistory\n\nRoman era\n\nthumb|Etruscan Civilization fresco from the Tomb of the Leopards\nthumb|upright=0.9|Expansion of the territory known as Italy from the establishment of the Roman Republic until Diocletian.\nThe Italian peninsula was divided into a multitude of tribal or ethnic territory prior to the Roman conquest of Italy in the 3rd century BC. After a series of wars between Greeks and Etruscans, the Latins, with Rome as their capital, gained the ascendancy by 272 BC, and completed the conquest of the Italian peninsula by 218 BC.\n\nThis period of unification was followed by one of conquest in the Mediterranean, beginning with the First Punic War against Carthage. In the course of the century-long struggle against Carthage, the Romans conquered Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. Finally, in 146 BC, at the conclusion of the Third Punic War, with Carthage completely destroyed and its inhabitants enslaved, Rome became the dominant power in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe process of Italian unification, and the associated Romanization, culminated in 88 BC, when, in the aftermath of the Social War, Rome granted  its Italian allies   full rights in Roman society, extending Roman citizenship to all Italic peoples.\n\nFrom its inception, Rome was a republican city-state, but four famous civil conflicts destroyed the republic: Lucius Cornelius Sulla against Gaius Marius and his son (88–82 BC), Julius Caesar against Pompey (49–45 BC), Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus against Mark Antony and Octavian (43 BC), and Mark Antony against Octavian.\nOctavian, the final victor (31 BC), was accorded the title of Augustus by the Senate and thereby became the first Roman emperor. Augustus created for the first time an administrative region called Italia with inhabitants called \"Italicus populus\", stretching from the Alps to Sicily: for this reason historians like Emilio Gentile called him Father of Italians. \n\nIn the 1st century BC, Italia was still a collection of territories with different political statuses. Some cities, called municipia, had some independence from Rome, while others, the coloniae, were founded by the Romans themselves. Around 7 BC, Augustus divided Italy into eleven regiones.\nDuring the Crisis of the Third Century the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. In 284, emperor Diocletian restored political stability. The importance of Rome declined, because the city was far from the troubled frontiers. \nThe seats of the Caesars were Augusta Treverorum (on the River Rhine frontier) for Constantius Chlorus and Sirmium (on the River Danube frontier) for Galerius who also resided at Thessaloniki.\nUnder Diocletian, Italy became the Dioecesis Italiciana, subdivided into thirteen provinces, now including Raetia. Under Constantine the Great, Italy became the Praetorian prefecture of Italy (praefectura praetoria Italiae), and was subdivided into two dioceses. Diocesis Italia annonaria  (Italy of the annona, governed from Milan) and  Diocesis Italia Suburbicaria (Italy \"under the government of the urbs\", i.e. governed from Rome).\nChristianity became the Roman state religion in AD 380, under emperor Theodosius I.\nThe last Western emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed in 476 by a Germanic foederati general in Italy, Odoacer. His defeat marked the end of the western part of the Roman Empire, and the end of the political unification of Italy until the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\n200px|thumb|right|Italy after the Peace of Lodi in 1454.\nOdoacer ruled well for 13 years after gaining control of Italy in 476. Then he was attacked and defeated by Theodoric, the king of another Germanic tribe, the Ostrogoths. Theodoric and Odoacer ruled jointly until 493, when Theodoric murdered Odoacer. Theodoric continued to rule Italy with an army of Ostrogoths and a government that was mostly Italian. After the death of Theodoric in 526, the kingdom began to grow weak. By 553, emperor Justinian I expelled the Ostrogoths, and Italy was included into the Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty.\nByzantine rule in Italy collapsed again by 572 as a result of invasions by another Germanic tribe, the Lombards.\nThe peninsula was now dominated by the Kingdom of the Lombards, with minor remnants of Byzantine control especially in the south.\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries, the popes increased their influence in both religious and political matters in Italy. It was usually the popes who led attempts to protect Italy from invasion or to soften foreign rule. For about 200 years the popes opposed attempts by the Lombards, who had captured most of Italy, to take over Rome as well. The popes finally defeated the Lombards with the aid of two Frankish kings, Pepin the Short and Charlemagne. Using land won for them by Pepin in 756, the popes established political rule in what were called the Papal States in central Italy.\n\nThe Lombards remained a threat to papal power, however, until they were crushed by Charlemagne in 774. Charlemagne added the Kingdom of the Lombards to his vast realm. In recognition of Charlemagne's power, and to cement the church's alliance with him, Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III in 800. After Charlemagne's death in 814, his son Louis the Pious succeeded him. Louis divided the empire among his sons, and\nFrankish Italy became part of Middle Francia, extending as far south as Rome and Spoleto. This Kingdom of Italy became part of the Holy Roman Empire in the 10th century,  while southern Italy was under the rule of the Lombard Principality of Benevento or of the Byzantine Empire, in the 12th century absorbed into the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\nRise of the city-states and the Renaissance\n\nFrom the 11th century on, Italian cities began to grow rapidly in independence and importance. They became centres of political life, banking, and foreign trade. Some became wealthy, and many, including Florence, Rome, Genoa, Milan, Pisa, Siena and Venice, grew into nearly independent city-states. Each had its own foreign policy and political life. They all resisted the efforts of noblemen and emperors to control them.\n\nThe emergence of identifiable Italian dialects from Vulgar Latin, and as such the possibility of a specifically \"Italian\" ethnic identity, has no clear-cut date, but takes place from roughly 12th century. Modern standard Italian derives from the written vernacular of   Tuscan writers of the 12th century.\nThe recognition of Italian vernaculars as literary languages in their own right begins with \nDe vulgari eloquentia, an essay written by Dante Alighieri at the beginning of the 14th century.\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, some Italian city-states ranked among the most important powers of Europe. Venice, in particular, had become a major maritime power, and the city-states as a group acted as a conduit for goods from the Byzantine and Islamic empires. In this capacity, they provided great impetus to the developing Renaissance, began in Florence in the 14th century, and led to an unparalleled flourishing of the arts, literature, music, and science.\n\nHowever, the city-states were often troubled by violent disagreements among their citizens. The most famous division was between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. The Guelphs supported supreme rule by the pope, and the Ghibellines favoured the emperor. City-states often took sides and waged war against each other. During the Renaissance, Italy became an even more attractive prize to foreign conquerors. After some city-states asked for outside help in settling disputes with their neighbours, King Charles VIII of France marched into Italy in 1494; he soon withdrew, showing that the Italian peninsula's delicate equilibrium could be taken advantage of. After the Italian Wars, Spain emerged as the dominant force in the region. Venice, Milan, and other city-states retained at least some of their former greatness during this period, as did Savoy-Piedmont, protected by the Alps and well defended by its vigorous rulers.\n\nThe French Revolution and Napoleon\n\nthumb|right|Laura Bassi, the first chairwoman of a university in a scientific field of studies\nThe French Revolution and Napoleon influenced Italy more deeply than they affected any other outside country of Europe. The French Revolution began in 1789 and immediately found supporters among the Italian people. The local Italian rulers, sensing danger in their own country, drew closer to the European kings who opposed France. After the French king was overthrown and France became a republic, secret clubs favouring an Italian republic were formed throughout Italy. The armies of the French Republic began to move across Europe. In 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte led a French army into northern Italy and drove out the Austrian rulers. Once again, Italy was the scene of battle between the Habsburgs and the French. Wherever France conquered, Italian republics were set up, with constitutions and legal reforms. Napoleon made himself emperor in 1804, and part of northern and central Italy was unified under the name of the Kingdom of Italy, with Napoleon as king. The rest of northern and central Italy was annexed by France. Only Sicily and the island of Sardinia, which had been ceded to the House of Savoy in 1720 and had been under their rule ever since, remained free of French control.\n\nFrench domination lasted less than 20 years, and it differed from previous foreign control of the Italian peninsula. In spite of heavy taxation and frequent harshness, the French introduced representative assemblies and new laws that were the same for all parts of the country. For the first time since the days of ancient Rome, Italians of different regions used the same money and served in the same army. Many Italians began to see the possibility of a united Italy free of foreign control.\n\nThe Kingdom of Italy\n\nthumb|left|upright=1.15|The Expedition of the Thousand.\n\nAfter the Battle of Waterloo, the reaction set in with the Congress of Vienna allowed the restoration of many of the old rulers and systems under Austrian domination. The concept of nationalism continued strong, however, and sporadic outbreaks led by such inveterate reformers as Giuseppe Mazzini occurred in several parts of the peninsula down to 1848–49. This Risorgimento movement was brought to a successful conclusion under the guidance of Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, prime minister of Piedmont.\n\nCavour managed to unite most of Italy under the headship of Victor Emmanuel II of the house of Savoy, and on 17 March 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel II as king. Giuseppe Garibaldi, the popular republican hero of Italy, contributed much to this achievement and to the subsequent incorporation of the Papal States under the Italian monarch. Italian troops occupied Rome in 1870, and in July 1871, this formally became the capital of the kingdom. Pope Pius IX, a longtime rival of Italian kings, stated he had been made a \"prisoner\" inside the Vatican walls and refused to cooperate with the royal administration. Only in 1929 did the Roman Pope accept the unified Italy with Rome as capital.\n\nIn the decades following unification, Italy started to create colonies in Africa, and under Benito Mussolini's fascism conquered Ethiopia founding in 1936 the Italian Empire. World War I has also been interpreted to have completed the process of Italian unification, with the annexation of Trieste, Istria, Trentino-Alto Adige and Zara. The Italians grew to 45 millions in 1940 and the land, whose economy had been until that time based upon agriculture, started its industrial development, mainly in northern Italy. But World War II soon destroyed Italy and its colonial power.\n\nThe Italian Republic\n\nBetween 1945 and 1948, the outlines of a new Italy began to appear. Victor Emmanuel III gave up the throne on 9 May 1946, and his son, Umberto II, became king. On 2 June Italy held its first free election after 20 years of Fascist rule (the so-called Ventennio). Italians chose a republic to replace the monarchy, which had been closely associated with Fascism. They elected a Constituent Assembly to prepare a new democratic constitution. The Assembly approved the constitution in 1947, which came into force on 1 January 1948.\n\nCulture\n\nthumb|The Pantheon and the Fontana del Pantheon. Roman relics and Roman culture are important national symbols in Italy.|alt=\nthumb|upright=1.15|Italian women dance the tarantella, 1846\nFrom the Magna Graecia period to the 17th century, the inhabitants of the Italian peninsula were at the forefront of Western culture, being the fulcrum and origin of Magna Graecia, Ancient Rome, the Roman Catholic Church, Humanism, the Renaissance, Baroque, the Counter-Reformation and Neoclassicism.\n\nItaly also became a seat of great formal learning in 1088 with the establishment of the University of Bologna, the first university in the Western World. Many other Italian universities soon followed. For example, the Schola Medica Salernitana, in southern Italy, was the first medical school in Europe. These great centres of learning presaged the Rinascimento: the European Renaissance began in Italy and was fueled throughout Europe by Italian painters, sculptors, architects, scientists, literature masters and music composers. Italy continued its leading cultural role through the Baroque period and into the Romantic period, when its dominance in painting and sculpture diminished but the Italians re-established a strong presence in music.\n\nItalian explorers and navigators in the 15th and 16th centuries left a perennial mark on human history with the modern \"discovery of America\", due to Christopher Columbus. In addition, the name of the American continents derives from the geographer Amerigo Vespucci's first name. Also noted, is explorer Marco Polo who travelled extensively throughout the eastern world recording his travels.\n\nDue to comparatively late national unification, and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the Italian peninsula, many traditions and customs of the Italians can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social isolation of these regions, Italy's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of the Western world remain immense. Famous elements of Italian culture are its opera and music, its iconic gastronomy and food, which are commonly regarded as amongst the most popular in the world, its cinema (with filmmakers such as Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Mario Monicelli, Sergio Leone, Alberto Sordi, etc.), its collections of priceless works of art and its fashion (Milan and Florence are regarded as some of the few fashion capitals of the world).\n\nPhilosophy\n\nthumb|Niccolò Machiavelli, the founder of modern political science and ethics.|alt=Over the ages Italian literature had a vast influence on Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and going onto Renaissance, The Enlightenment and modern philosophy.\nItalian Medieval philosophy was mainly Christian, and included several important philosophers and theologians such as St Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas was the student of Albert the Great, a brilliant Dominican experimentalist, much like the Franciscan, Roger Bacon of Oxford in the 13th century. Aquinas reintroduced Aristotelian philosophy to Christianity. He believed that there was no contradiction between faith and secular reason. He believed that Aristotle had achieved the pinnacle in the human striving for truth and thus adopted Aristotle's philosophy as a framework in constructing his theological and philosophical outlook. He was a professor at the prestigious University of Paris.\n\nItaly was also affected by the Enlightenment, a movement which was a consequence of the Renaissance and changed the road of Italian philosophy. Followers of the group often met to discuss in private salons and coffeehouses, notably in the cities of Milan, Rome and Venice. Cities with important universities such as Padua, Bologna and Naples, however, also remained great centres of scholarship and the intellect, with several philosophers such as Giambattista Vico (1668–1744) (who is widely regarded as being the founder of modern Italian philosophy) and Antonio Genovesi. Italian society also dramatically changed during the Enlightenment, with rulers such as Leopold II of Tuscany abolishing the death penalty. The church's power was significantly reduced, and it was a period of great thought and invention, with scientists such as Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani discovering new things and greatly contributing to Western science. Cesare Beccaria was also one of the greatest Italian Enlightenment writers and now considered one of the fathers of classical criminal theory as well as modern penology. Beccaria is famous for his masterpiece On Crimes and Punishments (1764), a treatise (later translated into 22 languages) that served as one of the earliest prominent condemnations of torture and the death penalty and thus a landmark work in anti-death penalty philosophy.\n\nSome of the most prominent philosophies and ideologies in Italy during the late 19th and 20th centuries include anarchism, communism, socialism, futurism, fascism, and Christian democracy. Both futurism and fascism (in its original form, now often distinguished as Italian fascism) were developed in Italy at this time. From the 1920s to the 1940s, Italian Fascism was the official philosophy and ideology of the Italian government led by Benito Mussolini. Giovanni Gentile was one of the most significant 20th-century Idealist/Fascist philosophers. Meanwhile, anarchism, communism, and socialism, though not originating in Italy, took significant hold in Italy during the early 20th century, with the country producing numerous significant Italian anarchists, socialists, and communists. In addition, anarcho-communism first fully formed into its modern strain within the Italian section of the First International.Nunzio Pernicone, Italian Anarchism 1864–1892, pp. 111-113, AK Press 2009. Antonio Gramsci remains an important philosopher within Marxist and communist theory, credited with creating the theory of cultural hegemony.\n\nLiterature\n\nItalian literature may be unearthed back to the Middle Ages, with the most significant poets of the period being Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio.\nDuring the Renaissance, humanists such as Leonardo Bruni, Coluccio Salutati and Niccolò Machiavelli were great collectors of antique manuscripts. Many worked for the organized Church and were in holy orders (like Petrarch), while others were lawyers and chancellors of Italian cities, like Petrarch's disciple, Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence, and thus had access to book copying workshops.\nOne of the most remarkable poets of the early 19 and 20th century writers was Giacomo Leopardi, who is widely acknowledged to be one of the most radical and challenging thinkers of the 19th century.The Least Known Masterpiece of European Literature, New RepublicThe Zibaldone project, University of Birmingham Italo Svevo, the author of La coscienza di Zeno (1923), and Luigi Pirandello (winner of the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature), who explored the shifting nature of reality in his prose fiction and such plays as Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore (Six Characters in Search of an Author, 1921).\nFederigo Tozzi and Giuseppe Ungaretti were well-known novelists, critically appreciated only in recent years, and regarded one of the forerunners of existentialism in the European novel.\n\nLaw and justice\nSince the Roman Empire, most western contributions to Western legal culture was the emergence of a class of Roman jurists. During the Middle Ages, St. Thomas Aquinas, the most influential western scholar of the period, integrated the theory of natural law with the notion of an eternal and biblical law.Code of Canon Law, Can. 252, § 3  During the Renaissance, Prof. Alberico Gentili, the founder of the science of international law, authored the first treatise on public international law and separated secular law from canon law and Roman Catholic theology. Enlightenment's greatest legal theorists, Cesare Beccaria, Giambattista Vico and Francesco Mario Pagano, are well remembered for their legal works, particularly on criminal law.\nFrancesco Carrara, an advocate of abolition of the death penalty, was one of the foremost European criminal lawyers of the 19th century. During the last periods, numerous Italians have been recognised as the prominent prosecutor magistrates.\n\nScience and technology\n\nItalians have been the central figures of countless inventions and discoveries and they made many predominant contributions to various fields. During the Renaissance, Italian polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), Michelangelo (1475–1564) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404–72) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include the invention of the thermometer and key improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of Copernicanism over the Ptolemaic model. Other astronomers such as Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625–1712) and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the Solar System.\nPhysicist Enrico Fermi (1901–54), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that built the first nuclear reactor and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the quantum theory. He and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by Fascist laws against Jews, including Emilio G. Segrè (1905–89) (who discovered the elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton),Lucia Orlando, \"Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the\" New Tasks\" of Physics in Italy.\" Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences (1998): 141-181. in JSTOR and Bruno Rossi (1905–93), a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy. Other prominent physicists and scientists include: Amedeo Avogadro (most noted for his contributions to molecular theory, in particular Avogadro's law and the Avogadro constant), Giulio Natta (the inventor of the first catalyst for the production of isotactic propylene and among the fathers of macromolecular chemistry, for which he won the Nobel prize for chemistry along with Karl Ziegler), Evangelista Torricelli (inventor of the barometer), Alessandro Volta (inventor of the electric battery), Guglielmo Marconi (inventor of radio), Antonio Meucci (known for developing a voice-communication apparatus, often credited as the inventor of the first telephone before even Alexander Graham Bell),Several Italian encyclopaedias claim Meucci as the inventor of the telephone, including: \n– the \"Treccani\" \n– the Italian version of Microsoft digital encyclopaedia, Encarta.\n– Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti (Italian Encyclopedia of Science, Literature and Arts). Galileo Ferraris (one of the pioneers of AC power system, invented the first induction motor), Ettore Majorana (who discovered the Majorana fermions), and Carlo Rubbia (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the W and Z particles at CERN).\n\nIn biology, Francesco Redi was the first to challenge the theory of spontaneous generation by demonstrating that maggots come from eggs of flies and he described 180 parasites in detail; Marcello Malpighi founded microscopic anatomy; Lazzaro Spallanzani conducted important research in bodily functions, animal reproduction, and cellular theory; Camillo Golgi, whose many achievements include the discovery of the Golgi complex, paved the way to the acceptance of the Neuron doctrine; Rita Levi-Montalcini discovered the nerve growth factor (awarded 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine); Angelo Ruffini first described the Ruffini endings and was known for his work in histology and embryology; Filippo Pacini discovered the Pacinian corpuscles and was the first to isolate the cholera bacillus Vibrio cholerae in 1854, before Robert Koch's more widely accepted discoveries 30 years later. In chemistry, Giulio Natta received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 for his work on high polymers. Giuseppe Occhialini received the Wolf Prize in Physics for the discovery of the pion or pi-meson decay in 1947. \n\nMathematics\nDuring the Middle Ages, Leonardo Fibonacci, the greatest Western mathematician of the Middle Ages, introduced the Hindu–Arabic numeral system to the Western World and he also introduced the sequence of Fibonacci numbers which he used as an example in Liber Abaci. Gerolamo Cardano, introduced the probability and established the binomial coefficients and binomial theorem and he also invented some essential onjects. During the Renaissance, Luca Pacioli established accounting to the world, published the first work on Double-entry bookkeeping system. Galileo Galilei made several significant advances in mathematics. Bonaventura Cavalieri's works anticipated integral calculus and popularized logarithms in Italy. Jacopo Riccati, who was also a jurist, invented the Riccati equation. Maria Gaetana Agnesi, the first woman to write a mathematics handbook, become the first woman mathematics professor at a university. Gian Francesco Malfatti, posed the problem of carving three circular columns out of a triangular block of marble, using as much of the marble as possible, and conjectured that three mutually-tangent circles inscribed within the triangle would provide the optimal solution, which are now known as Malfatti circles. Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who was one of the most influential mathematician of his time, made essential works to analysis, number theory, and both classical and celestial mechanics. Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro invented the Tensor calculus and made meaningful works on algebra, infinitesimal analysis, and papers on the theory of real numbers. Giuseppe Peano, founded the mathematical logic, the set theory, and alongside John Venn drew the first Venn diagram. Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro is well known for his invention on absolute differential calculus (tensor calculus), further developed by Tullio Levi-Civita, and its applications to the theory of relativity. Beniamino Segre is one of the main contributor of algebraic geometry and one of the founders of finite geometry. Paolo Ruffini is credited for his innovative work in mathematics, creating \"Ruffini's rule\" and co-creating the Abel–Ruffini theorem. Ennio de Giorgi, a Wolf Prize in Mathematics recipient in 1990, solved Bernstein's problem about minimal surfaces and the 19th Hilbert problem on the regularity of solutions of Elliptic partial differential equations.\n\nArchitecture\n\nAs Italy is home to the greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites (51) to date and it is home to half the world's great art treasures, Italians are known for their significant architectural achievements,Architecture in Italy, ItalyTravel.com such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during ancient Rome, the founding of the Renaissance architectural movement in the late-14th to 16th centuries, and being the homeland of Palladianism, a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of Neoclassical architecture, and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries. Several of the finest works in Western architecture, such as the Colosseum, the Milan Cathedral and Florence cathedral, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the building designs of Venice are found in Italy.\n\nItalian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world. British architect Inigo Jones, inspired by the designs of Italian buildings and cities, brought back the ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture to 17th-century England, being inspired by Andrea Palladio. Additionally, Italianate architecture, popular abroad since the 19th century, was used to describe foreign architecture which was built in an Italian style, especially modelled on Renaissance architecture.\n\nMusic\n\nthumb|upright|Bartolomeo Cristofori, the inventor of the piano\n\nFrom folk music to classical, music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.\nItalians invented many of the musical instruments, including the piano and violin.\n\nMost notable Italians composers include the Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Claudio Monteverdi, the Baroque composers Scarlatti, Corelli and Vivaldi, the Classical composers Paganini and Rossini, and the Romantic composers Verdi and Puccini, whose operas, including La bohème, Tosca, Madama Butterfly, and Turandot, are among the most frequently worldwide performed in the standard repertoire. Modern Italian composers such as Berio and Nono proved significant in the development of experimental and electronic music. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as La Scala of Milan and San Carlo of Naples, and performers such as the pianist Maurizio Pollini and the late tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene.\n\nItalians are amply known as the mothers of opera. Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century, in Italian cities such as Mantua and Venice. Later, works and pieces composed by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are among the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include Enrico Caruso and Alessandro Bonci.\n\nIntroduced in the early 1920s, jazz took a particularly strong foothold among Italians, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock movement of the 1970s, with bands like PFM and Goblin. Italy was also an important country in the development of disco and electronic music, with Italo disco, known for its futuristic sound and prominent usage of synthesizers and drum machines, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from Euro disco (which later went on to influence several genres such as Eurodance and Nu-disco).\n\nProducers and songwriters such as Giorgio Moroder, who won three Academy Awards for his music, were highly influential in the development of EDM (electronic dance music). Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the Sanremo Music Festival, which served as inspiration for the Eurovision song contest, and the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto. Singers such as pop diva Mina, classical crossover artist Andrea Bocelli, Grammy winner Laura Pausini, and European chart-topper Eros Ramazzotti have attained international acclaim.\n\nCinema\n\nthumb|left|170px|Federico Fellini, recognized as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time.\nSince the development of the Italian film industry in the early 1900s, Italian filmmakers and performers have, at times, experienced both domestic and international success, and have influenced film movements throughout the world.\n\nFollowing the Fascist era, characterized by the Telefoni Bianchi genre, they got international critical acclaim through the Neorealist genre, and starting from the 1960s through the Commedia all'italiana genre as well as through a number of auteurs such as Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni and Roberto Rossellini. Actresses such as Sophia Loren, Giulietta Masina and Gina Lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period.Katz, Ephraim, \"Italy,\" The Film Encyclopedia (New York: HarperResource, 2001), pp. 682-685.\n\nSince the early 1960s they also popularized a large number of genres and subgenres, such as Peplum, Macaroni Combat, Musicarello, Poliziotteschi and Commedia sexy all'italiana. The Spaghetti Western achieved popularity in the mid-1960s, peaking with Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, which featured enigmatic scores by composer Ennio Morricone.  Erotic Italian thrillers, or Giallos, produced by directors such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento in the 1970s, influenced the horror genre worldwide. In recent years, directors such as Ermanno Olmi, Bernardo Bertolucci, Giuseppe Tornatore, Gabriele Salvatores, Roberto Benigni, Matteo Garrone, Paolo Sorrentino and Luca Guadagnino brought critical acclaim back to Italian cinema.\n\nSo far, Italy has won 14 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, the most of any country, and 12 Palme d'Or, the second-most of any country.\n\nSport\n\nthumb|upright=0.85|Motorcycle racer Giacomo Agostini|alt=\nthumb|right|upright=0.9|Gianluigi Buffon, the highest-priced goalkeeper and the most capped player for the Italian national team \nItalians have a long tradition in sport.\nIn numerous sports, both individual and team, Italy has been very successful.\n\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Italy.\nItaly is one of the most successful national teams in association football having four FIFA World Cups, one UEFA European Championship and one Olympic tournament.\nAmongst the players who won the FIFA World Cup there are Giuseppe Meazza, Silvio Piola (to date the highest goalscorer in Italian first league history), Dino Zoff, Paolo Rossi, Marco Tardelli, Bruno Conti, Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Del Piero, Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti.\nAmongst those who did not win the World Cup but laureated as European champions are Gianni Rivera, Luigi Riva (to date Italy's leading scorer of all time), Sandro Salvadore, Giacomo Bulgarelli, Pietro Anastasi and Giacinto Facchetti.\nOther prominent players who achieved success at club level are Giampiero Boniperti, Romeo Benetti, Roberto Boninsegna, Roberto Bettega, Roberto Baggio and Paolo Maldini.\nOf the above-mentioned, the goalkeeper Dino Zoff, who served in the National team from 1968 to 1983, is to date the only Italian player to have won both the European championship (in 1968) and the FIFA World Cup (in 1982), apart from being the oldest winner ever of the World Cup.\nAt club level, to date Italy has won a total of 12 European Cup / Champions' Leagues, 9 UEFA Cups / UEFA Europa League and 7 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nMotorcycle racers such as Giacomo Agostini and Valentino Rossi are recognized as some of the greatest sportstars of all time. Federica Pellegrini, one of the few female swimmers to have set world records in more than one event has been one of the world's most successful swimmers. Italian athletes have won 549 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 114 medals at the Winter Olympic Games. Jessica Rossi scored a Shooting sport world record of 75 in the qualification and a world record of 99. As for Olympic games, 663 Italians won medals, particularly in Swordsmanship, which makes them the 6th most successful ethnic group in Olympic history. There are more than 2,000,000 Italian skiers in the world, most of them in the north and in the centre. Italian skiers received good results in the Winter Olympic Games, World Cup, and World Championships.\n\nItalians are the second of the most who have won the World Cycling Championship more than any other country after Belgium. The Giro d'Italia is a world-famous long-distance cycling race held every May, and constitutes one of the three Grand Tours, along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, each of which last approximately three weeks.\nTennis has a significant following near courts and on television. Italian professional tennis players are almost always in the top 100 world ranking of male and female players. Beach tennis with paddle racquet was invented by Italians, and is practised by many people across the country.\nVolleyball is played by a lot of amateur players and professional players compete in the Italian Volleyball League, regarded as the best and most difficult volleyball league in the world. The male and female national teams are often in the top 4 ranking of teams in the world.\nAthletics is a popular sport for Italians, as the Italian World and Olympic champions are very celebrated people.\nIn wrestling, one of the most remarkable wrestlers is Bruno Sammartino, who held the record of the WWWF (World) Heavyweight Championship for over 11 years across two reigns, the first of which is the longest single reign in the promotion's history.\n\nRugby union was imported from France in the 1910s and has been regularly played since the 1920s; the National team has progressed slowly but significantly during the decades and thanks to the good results achieved in the second half of the 1990s, when they managed to beat historical teams like Scotland, Ireland and eventually France, Italy gained the admission to the Five Nation Championship, later renamed Six Nations; Italy has taken part to the Rugby World Cup since its inauguration in 1987 and never missed an edition though to date has never gone past the group stage.\n\nEthnogenesis\n\nDue to historic demographic shifts in the Italian peninsula throughout history, as well as Italy's ethnic diversity since ancient times, the modern Italians are not a genetically homogeneous population....\"L’Italia è, dal punto di vista genetico, un mosaico di gruppi etnici ben differenziati.\" Alberto Piazza, I profili genetici degli italiani, Accademia delle Scienze di Torino This includes pre-Indo-Europeans, such as the Etruscans and the Ligures, and pre-Roman Indo-European peoples, like the Celts, the Italic peoples (such as the Latino-Faliscans, the Osco-Umbrians, the Sicels and the Veneti), and a significant number of Greeks. The majority of Italians originate from these two primary elements and, like much of the Romance-speaking Southern Europe, share a common Latin heritage and history.\n\nAncient history\n\nThe earliest modern humans inhabiting Italy are believed to have been Paleolithic peoples that may have arrived in the Italian Peninsula as early as 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Italy is believed to have been a major Ice-age refuge from which Paleolithic humans later colonized Europe. \n\nThe Neolithic colonization of Europe from Western Asia and the Middle East beginning around 10,000 years ago reached Italy, as most of the rest of the continent although, according to the demic diffusion model, its impact was most in the southern and eastern regions of the European continent.\n\nIndo-European\nStarting in the 4th millennium BC as well as in the Bronze Age, the first wave of migrations into Italy of Indo-European-speaking peoples occurred, with the appearance of the Remedello, the Rinaldone and the Gaudo cultures. These were later (from the 18th century BC) followed by others that can be identified as Italo-Celts, with the appearance of the Proto-Celtic Canegrate cultureVenceslas Kruta: La grande storia dei celti. La nascita, l'affermazione e la decadenza, Newton & Compton, 2003, ,  and the Proto-Italic Terramare culture, both deriving from the Proto-Italo-Celtic Tumulus and Unetice cultures.\n\nLater, Celtic La Tène and Hallstatt cultures have been documented in Italy as far south as Umbria and Latium in Central Italy, also inhabited by the Rutuli and the Umbri, closely related to the Ligures.Nicholas Hammond, Howard Scullard. Dizionario di antichità classiche. Milano, Edizioni San Paolo, 1995, p.1836-1836. . Italics occupied Southern and Central Italy: the \"West Italic\" group (including the Latins) were the first wave. They had cremation burials and possessed advanced metallurgical techniques. Major tribes included the Latins and Falisci in Lazio; the Oenotrians and Italii in Calabria; the Ausones, Aurunci and Opici in Campania; and perhaps Sicels in Sicily. They were followed, and largely displaced by East Italic (Osco-Umbrians) group.Cornell, T. J. (1995): The Beginnings of Rome. p43\n\nPre-Roman\nthumb|upright=1.8|Fresco of dancing Peucetian women in the Tomb of the Dancers in Ruvo di Puglia, 4th–5th century BC\nBy the beginning of the Iron Age the Etruscans emerged as the dominant civilization on the Italian peninsula. The Etruscans, whose primary home was in Etruria (modern Tuscany), inhabited a large part of central and northern Italy extending as far north as the Po Valley and as far south as Capua.Samuel Edward Finer, The History of Government from the Earliest Times, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 398 Traditionally the Etruscans were said to have migrated to Italy from Anatolia, but modern archaeological and genetic research suggests descent from the indigenous Villanovan culture of Italy.Cavalli-Sforza, L. L., P. Menozzi, A. Piazza. 1994. The History and Geography of Human Genes.  Princeton University Press, Princeton.  \n\nThe Ligures are said to have been one of the oldest populations in Italy and Western Europe,Léon Homo, Primitive Italy, Routledge, 1996, p. 45 possibly of Pre-Indo-European origin.Karl Viktor Müllenhoff, Deutsche Alterthurnskunde, I volume. According to Strabo they were not Celts, but later became influenced by the Celtic culture of their neighbours, and thus are sometimes referred to as Celticized Ligurians or Celto-Ligurians.Strabo, Geography, book 2, chapter 5, section 28. Their language had affinities with both Italic (Latin and the Osco-Umbrian languages) and Celtic (Gaulish). They primarily inhabited the regions of Liguria, Piedmont, northern Tuscany, western Lombardy, western Emilia-Romagna and northern Sardinia, but are believed to have once occupied an even larger portion of ancient Italy as far south as Sicily.Leonard Robert Palmer, The Latin Language, London: Faber and Faber, 1954, p. 54 They were also settled in Corsica and in the Provence region along the southern coast of modern France.\n\nDuring the Iron Age, prior to Roman rule, the peoples living in the area of modern Italy and the islands were:\n Etruscans (Camunni, Lepontii, Raeti);\n Ligures (Apuani, Bagienni, Briniates, Corsi, Friniates, Garuli, Hercates, Ilvates, Insubres, Orobii, Laevi, Lapicini, Marici, Statielli, Taurini);\n Italics (Latins, Falisci, Marsi, Umbri, Volsci, Marrucini, Osci, Aurunci, Ausones, Campanians, Paeligni, Sabines, Bruttii, Frentani, Lucani, Samnites, Pentri, Caraceni, Caudini, Hirpini, Aequi, Fidenates, Hernici, Picentes, Vestini, Morgeti, Sicels, Veneti);Iapygians (Messapians, Daunians, Peucetians);\n Gauls (Ausones, Boii, Carni, Cenomani, Graioceli, Lingones, Segusini, Senones, Salassi, Vertamocorii);\n Greeks of Magna Graecia, in southern Italy;\n Sardinians''' (Nuragic tribes);\n\nItaly was, throughout the pre-Roman period, predominantly inhabited by Italic tribes who occupied the modern regions of Lazio, Umbria, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Basilicata, Calabria, Apulia and Sicily. Sicily, in addition to having an Italic population in the Sicels, also was inhabited by the Sicani and the Elymians, of uncertain origin. The Veneti, most often regarded as an Italic tribe,According, among others, to:  Cf.  chiefly inhabited the Veneto, but extended as far east as Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Istria, and had colonies as far south as Lazio.(C. Plinii, Naturalis Historia, III, 68-69)\n\nBeginning in the 8th century BC, Greeks arrived in Italy and founded cities along the coast of southern Italy and eastern Sicily, which became known as Magna Graecia (\"Greater Greece\"). The Greeks were frequently at war with the native Italic tribes, but nonetheless managed to Hellenize and assimilate a good portion of the indigenous population located along eastern Sicily and the Southern coasts of the Italian mainland. According to Beloch the number of Greek citizens in south Italy at its greatest extent reached only 80,000–90,000, while the local people subjected by the Greeks were between 400,000–600,000.P. A. Brunt, Italian manpower, 225 B.C.-A.D. 14, Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 52La popolazione del Mondo Greco-Romano, Karl Julius Beloch By the 4th and 3rd century BC, Greek power in Italy was challenged and began to decline, and many Greeks were pushed out of peninsular Italy by the native Oscan, Brutti and Lucani tribes.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, Vol. 1, Boston: Little, Brown, and Company. 1854. p. 4\n\nThe Gauls crossed the Alps and invaded northern Italy in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, settling in the area that became known as Cisalpine Gaul (\"Gaul on this side of the Alps\"). Although named after the Gauls, the region was mostly inhabited by indigenous tribes, namely the Ligures, Etruscans, Veneti and Euganei. Estimates by Beloch and Brunt suggest that in the 3rd century BC the Gaulish settlers of north Italy numbered between 130,000–140,000 out of a total population of about 1.4 million.Luuk De Ligt, Peasants, Citizens and Soldiers: Studies in the Demographic History of Roman Italy 225 BC – AD 100. Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. 43-44 According to Pliny and Livy, after the invasion of the Gauls, some of the Etruscans living in the Po Valley sought refuge in the Alps and became known as the Raeti.Pliny the Elder III.20Livy V.33 The Raeti inhabited the region of Trentino-Alto Adige, as well as eastern Switzerland and Tyrol in western Austria. The Ladins of north-eastern Italy and the Romansh people of Switzerland are said to be descended from the Raeti.Cambridge Anthropology, Vol. 6, 1980, p. 60\n\nRoman\n\nthumb|left|upright=1.35|Map of roman coloniae during the second century in Italy\nThe Romans—who according to legend originally consisted of three ancient tribes: Latins, Sabines and EtruscansA Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, Vol. 3, London. John Murray: printed by Spottiswoode and Co., New-Street Square and Parliament Streetp. 661—would go on to conquer the whole Italian peninsula. During the Roman period hundreds of cities and colonies were established throughout Italy, including Florence, Turin, Como, Pavia, Padua, Verona, Vicenza, Trieste and many others. Initially many of these cities were colonized by Latins, but later also included colonists belonging to the other Italic tribes who had become Latinized and joined to Rome. After the Roman conquest of Italy \"the whole of Italy had become Latinized\".M. Rostovtzeff, A History of the Ancient World: Rome, Vol. II, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927, p. 171\n\nAfter the Roman conquest of Cisalpine Gaul and the widespread confiscations of Gallic territory, much of the Gaulish population was killed or expelled.Alfred S. Bradford, With Arrow, Sword, and Spear: A History of Warfare in the Ancient World, Praeger Publishers, 2001, p. 191Strabo, 5.1.10 Many colonies were established by the Romans in the former Gallic territory of Cisalpine Gaul, which was then settled by Roman and Italic people. These colonies included Bologna, Modena, Reggio Emilia, Parma, Piacenza, Cremona and Forlì. According to Strabo:\n\"The greater part of the country used to be occupied by the Boii, Ligures, Senones, and Gaesatae; but since the Boii have been driven out, and since both the Gaesatae and the Senones have been annihilated, only the Ligurian tribes and the Roman colonies are left.\"\nThe Boii, the most powerful and numerous of the Gallic tribes, were expelled by the Romans after 191 BC and settled in Bohemia.Strabo, 5.213.\n\nPopulation movement and exchange among people from different regions was not uncommon during the Roman period. Latin colonies were founded at Ariminum in 268 and at Firmum in 264, while large numbers of Picentes, who previously inhabited the region, were moved to Paestum and settled along the river Silarus in Campania. Between 180–179 BC, 47,000 Ligures belonging to the Apuani tribe were removed from their home along the modern Ligurian-Tuscan border and deported to Samnium, an area corresponding to inland Campania, while Latin colonies were established in their place at Pisa, Lucca and Luni.Ettore Pais, Ancient Italy: Historical and Geographical Investigations in Central Italy, Magna Graecia, Sicily, and Sardinia, The University of Chicago Press, 1908 Such population movements contributed to the rapid Romanization and Latinization of Italy.Patrick Bruun, Studies in the romanization of Etruria, Vol. 1-7, p. 101\n\nMiddle Ages and modern period\nthumb|right|Lombard (Northern Italian) colonies of Sicily: in light blue: the cities where Gallo-Italic language is spoken today.\nIn dark blue: the cities where there is a good influence of the Gallo-Italic language.\nIn purple: ancient Gallo-Italic colonies, the influence in these cities is variable, also some districts of Messina were colonized.\n\nA large Germanic confederation of Scirii, Heruli, Turcilingi and Rugians, led by Odoacer, invaded and settled Italy in 476.Jordanes, Getica 243 They were preceded by 120,000 Alemanni, including 30,000 warriors with their families, who settled in the Po Valley in 371,Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae 28,5,15 and by 100,000 Burgundians who settled between North Western Italy and Southern France in 443. The Germanic tribe of the Ostrogoths led by Theoderic the Great conquered Italy and presented themselves as upholders of Latin culture, mixing Roman culture together with Gothic culture, in order to legitimize their rule amongst Roman subjects who had a long-held belief in the superiority of Roman culture over foreign \"barbarian\" Germanic culture. The number of Goths under Theodoric has been variously estimated between 200,000 and 250,000. Since Italy had a population of several million, the Goths did not constitute a significant addition to the local population.Frank N. Magill, The Middle Ages: Dictionary of World Biography, Volume 2, Salem Press, Inc. 1998, p. 895. At the height of their power, there were about 200,000 Ostrogoths in a population of 6 or 7 million.William A. Sumruld, Augustine and the Arians: The Bishop of Hippo's Encounters with Ulfilan Arianism, Associated Press University Presses 1994, p. 23. Before them, Radagaisus led between 200,000 and 400,000 Goths in Italy in 406 perhaps too high as ancient sources routinely inflated the numbers of tribal invaders. After the Gothic War, which devastated the local population, the Ostrogoths were defeated. But in the sixth century, another Germanic tribe known as the Longobards invaded Italy, which in the meantime had been reconquered by the East Roman or Byzantine Empire. The Longobards were a small minority compared to the roughly four million people in Italy at the time.Antonio Santosuosso, Barbarians, Marauders, and Infidels: The Ways of Medieval Warfare, Westview Press 2004, p. 44. They were no more than 500,000 settlers – 10-15% of the total population. They were later followed by the Bavarians and the Franks, who conquered and ruled most of Italy. Numerous groups of Slavs and Bulgars, pushed by the Khazars, settled in the Italian peninsula between the 7th and the 8th centuries.\n\nFollowing Roman rule, Sicily and Sardinia were conquered by the Vandals, then by the Ostrogoths, and finally by the Byzantines. At one point, while Sardinia grew increasingly autonomous from Byzantine rule to the point of organizing itself into four sovereign Kingdoms or \"Judgedoms\" (Judicati) that would last until the Aragonese conquest in the 15th century. In 687, Sicily became the Byzantine Theme of Sicily, during the course of the Arab-Byzantine wars Sicily gradually came became the Emirate of Sicily (831–1072). Later a series of conflicts with the Normans; would bring about the establishment of the County of Sicily, and eventually the Kingdom of Sicily, the Lombards of Sicily (not to be confused with the Longobards), coming from the Northern Italy, settled in the central and eastern part of Sicily. After the marriage between the Norman Roger I of Sicily with Adelaide del Vasto, descendant of Aleramici family, many Northern Italian colonisers (known collectively as Lombards) left their homeland, in the Aleramici's possessions in Piedmont and Liguria (then known as Lombardy), to settle on the island of Sicily.These Lombard colonisers were natives from Northern Italy and should not be confused with the Lombard Germanic tribe, who were referred to as Longobardi to distinguish them from the locals of the region who were known as Lombardi.\n\nBefore them, other Lombards arrived in Sicily, with an expedition departed in 1038, led by the Byzantine commander George Maniakes,Jules Gay, L'Italie meridionale et l'empire Byzantin, Parigi 1904, vol. II, p. 450-453. which for a very short time managed to snatch Messina and Syracuse from Arab rule. The Lombards who arrived with the Byzantines settled in Maniace, Randazzo and Troina, while a group of Genoese and other Lombards from Liguria settled in Caltagirone.David Abulafia, Le due Italie: relazioni economiche fra il regno normanno di Sicilia e i comuni settentrionali, Cambridge University Press 1977 (trad. it. Guida Editori, Napoli 1991), p. 114.\n\nthumb|upright=0.9|left|Map of Tuscan settlements in Sicily.\n\nDuring the subsequent Swabian rule under the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who spent most of his life as king of Sicily in his court in Palermo, Muslims was progressively eradicated until the massive deportation of the last Muslims of Sicily. As a result of Arab expulsion, many towns across Sicily were left depopulated. By the 12th century, Swabian kings granted immigrants from northern Italy (particularly Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria), Latium and Tuscany in central Italy, and French regions of Normandy, Provence and Brittany (all collectively known as Lombards.) settlement into Sicily, re-establishing the Latin element into the island, a legacy which can be seen in the many Gallo-Italic dialects and towns found in the interior and western parts of Sicily, brought by these settlers. It is believed that the Lombard immigrants in Sicily over a couple of centuries were a total of about 200,000.According to the most credible hypothesis this settlement dates back to a period between the eleventh century and the thirteenth century. Cfr. \n\nAn estimated 20,000 Swabians and 40,000 Normans settled in the southern half of Italy during this period. Additional Tuscan migrants settled in Sicily after the Florentine conquest of Pisa in 1406.\n\nSome of the expelled Muslims were deported to Lucera (Lugêrah, as it was known in Arabic). Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called Lucaera Saracenorum'' because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. The colony thrived for 75 years until it was sacked in 1300 by Christian forces under the command of the Angevin Charles II of Naples. The city's Muslim inhabitants were exiled or sold into slavery,Julie Taylor. Muslims in Medieval Italy: The Colony at Lucera. Lanham, Md.: Lexington Books. 2003. with many finding asylum in Albania across the Adriatic Sea.Ataullah Bogdan Kopanski. Islamization of Shqeptaret: The clas of Religions in Medieval Albania.  After the expulsions of Muslims in Lucera, Charles II replaced Lucera's Saracens with Christians, chiefly Burgundian and Provençal soldiers and farmers, following an initial settlement of 140 Provençal families in 1273. A remnant of the descendants of these Provençal colonists, still speaking a Franco-Provençal dialect, has survived until the present day in the villages of Faeto and Celle di San Vito.\n\nSubstantial migrations of Lombards to Naples, Rome and Palermo, continued in the 16th and 17th centuries, driven by the constant overcrowding in the north. Beside that, minor but significant settlements of Slavs (the so-called Schiavoni) and Arbereshe in Italy have been recorded.\n\nThe geographical and cultural proximity with Southern Italy pushed Albanians to cross the Strait of Otranto, especially after Skanderbeg's death and the conquest of the Balkans by the Ottomans. In defense of the Christian religion and in search of soldiers loyal to the Spanish crown, Alfonso V of Aragon, also king of Naples, invited Arbereshe soldiers to move to Italy with their families. In return the king guaranteed to Albanians lots of land and a favourable taxation.\n\nArbereshe and Schiavoni were used to repopulate abandoned villages or villages whose population had died in earthquakes, plagues and other catastrophes. Albanian soldiers were also used to quell rebellions in Calabria.\n\nMajor Slavic colonies were in Friuli, Veneto, Marche, Sicily and throughout the Kingdom of Naples (including Apulia, Molise, Abruzzo, Calabria, Terra di Lavoro and Campania).\n\nBetween the Late Middle Ages and early modern period, there were several waves of immigration of Albanians into Italy, in addition to another in the 20th century. The descendants of these Albanian emigrants, many still retaining the Albanian language, the Arbëresh dialect, have survived throughout Italy, numbering about 260,000 people,Ethnobotany in the New Europe: People, Health and Wild Plant Resources, vol. 14, Manuel Pardo de Santayana, Andrea Pieroni, Rajindra K. Puri, Berghahn Books, 2010, , p. 18. with roughly 80,000 to 100,000 speaking the Albanian language. Handbook of ethnotherapies, Christine E. Gottschalk-Batschkus, Joy C. Green, BoD – Books on Demand, 2002, , p. 110.\n\nItalian diaspora\n\nItalian migration outside Italy took place, in different migrating cycles, for centuries. A diaspora in high numbers took place after its unification in 1861 and continued through 1914 with the emergence of the First World War. This rapid outflow and migration of Italian people across the globe can be attributed to factors such as the internal economic slump that emerged alongside its unification, family and the industrial boom that occurred in the world surrounding Italy.\n\nItaly after its unification did not seek nationalism but instead sought work. However, a unified state did not automatically constitute a sound economy. The global economic expansion, ranging from Britain's Industrial Revolution in the late 18th and through mid 19th century, to the use of slave labor in the Americas did not hit Italy until much later (with the exception of the \"industrial triangle\" between Milan, Genoa and Turin)  This lag resulted in a deficit of work available in Italy and the need to look for work elsewhere.The mass industrialization and urbanization globally resulted in higher labor mobility and the need for Italians to stay anchored to the land for economic support declined.\n\nMoreover, better opportunities for work were not the only incentive to move; family played a major role and the dispersion of Italians globally.  Italians were more likely to migrate to countries where they had family established beforehand. These ties are shown to be stronger in many cases than the monetary incentive for migration, taking into account a familial base and possibly an Italian migrant community, greater connections to find opportunities for work, housing etc. Thus, thousands of Italian men and women left Italy and dispersed around the world and this trend only increased as World War I approached.\n\nNotably, it was not as if Italians had never migrated before, internal migration between North and Southern Italy before unification was common. Northern Italy caught on to the global industrialization sooner than Southern Italy, therefore it was considered more modern technologically, and tended to be inhabited by the bourgeoisie. Alternatively, rural and agro-intensive Southern Italy was seen as economically backward and was mainly populated by lower class peasantry. Given these disparities, prior to unification (and arguably after) the two sections of Italy, North and South were essentially seen by Italians and other nations as separate countries. So, migrating from one part of Italy to next could be seen as though they were indeed migrating to another country or even continent.\n\nFurthermore, large-scale migrations phenomena did not recede until the late 1920s, well into the Fascist regime, and one last wave can be observed after the end of the Second World War.\n\nOver 80 million people of full or part Italian descent live outside Europe, with over 60 million living in South America (mostly in Brazil, which has the largest number of Italian descendants outside Italy, and Argentina, where over 62.5% of the population have at least one Italian ancestor), 20 million living in North America (United States and Canada) and 1 million in Oceania (Australia and New Zealand). Others live in other parts of Europe (primarily The United Kingdom, Germany, France and Switzerland). Most Italian citizens living abroad live in other nations of the European Union.\n\nIn recent years, The United Arab Emirates has maintained a desirable destination for Italian immigrants, with the number of Italians leaving for the UAE having gone up 40% between 2005 and 2007. currently, over 10,000 Italians live in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nRegarding the diaspora, there are many individuals of Italian descent who are possibly eligible for Italian citizenship by method of jus sanguinis which is from the Latin meaning \"by blood.\" However, on a bases of just having Italian ancestry is not enough to qualify for Italian citizenship. To qualify, one must have at least one Italian born citizen ancestor who, after emigrating from Italy to another country, had passed citizenship onto their children before they naturalized as citizens of their newly adopted country. The Italian government does not have a rule regarding on how many generations born outside of Italy can claim Italian nationality.\n\nAutochthonous Italian communities outside Italy\n\nIn both the Slovenian and Croatian portions of Istria, in Dalmatia as well as in the city of Rijeka, Italian refers to autochthonous speakers of Italian and various Italo-Dalmatian languages, natives in the region since before the inception of the Venetian Republic. In the aftermath of the Istrian exodus following the Second World War, most Italian-speakers are today predominantly located in the west and south of Istria, and number about 30,000. The number of inhabitants with Italian ancestry is likely much greater but undeterminable. In the first Austrian census carried out in 1870 the number of Italian Dalmatians varied between 40,000 and 50,000 amongst the about 250,000 inhabitants of Dalmatia, or 20% of the total Dalmatian population.\n\nIn the French County of Nice, autochthonous speakers of regional languages of Italy (Ligurian and Piedmontese), are natives in the region since before annexation to France in 1860. The number of inhabitants with Italian ancestry is generally indeterminable, and the use of French language is now ubiquitous. In addition, Corsica was a part of the Republic of Genoa until 1768 and most of the islanders still have a certain level of proficiency of Corsican, a language of the Italo-Dalmatian family closely related to Tuscan. The Italian language ceased to have official status in Corsica in 1859Abalain, Hervé, (2007) Le français et les langues historiques de la France, Éditions Jean-Paul Gisserot, pp.113 when it was supplanted by French and a process of de-Italianization was started by the French government in Corsica (and in 1861 the Nizzardo area).\n\nA similar process happened in Malta, where the Maltese Italians have practically disappeared in the last two centuries after Britain took control of the island during Napoleon times. However, the Italian language is today spoken and understood by 66% of the population.\n\nSwiss Italian is spoken as natively by about 350,000 people in the canton of Ticino and in the southern part of Graubünden (Canton Grigioni). Swiss-Italian also refers to the Italian speaking population in this region (southern Switzerland) close to the border with Italy. Swiss Italian dialects are spoken in emigrant communities around the world, including in Australia.\n\nSee also\n Demographics of Italy\n List of Italians\n List of Sardinians\n List of Sicilians\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCategory:Ethnic groups in Italy\n \nCategory:Romance peoples"

The mathematical theory of L systems (Academic Press, New York, 1980).  and can be used to generate self-similar fractals.\n\nOrigins\nthumb|300px|'Weeds', generated using an L-system in 3D.\nAs a biologist, Lindenmayer worked with yeast and filamentous fungi and studied the growth patterns of various types of bacteria, such as the cyanobacteria Anabaena catenula. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.\n\nL-system structure\nThe recursive nature of the L-system rules leads to self-similarity and thereby, fractal-like forms are easy to describe with an L-system.   Plant models and natural-looking organic forms are easy to define, as by increasing the recursion level the form slowly 'grows' and becomes more complex. Lindenmayer systems are also popular in the generation of artificial life.\n\nL-system grammars are very similar to the semi-Thue grammar (see Chomsky hierarchy).  L-systems are now commonly known as parametric L systems, defined as a tuple\n\nG = (V, ω, P),\n\nwhere\n\n V (the alphabet) is a set of symbols containing both elements that can be replaced (variables) and those which cannot be replaced (\"constants\" or \"terminals\")\n ω (start, axiom or initiator) is a string of symbols from V defining the initial state of the system\n P is a set of production rules or productions defining the way variables can be replaced with combinations of constants and other variables. A production consists of two strings, the predecessor and the successor. For any symbol A which is a member of the set V which does not appear on the left hand side of a production in P, the identity production A → A is assumed; these symbols are called constants or terminals. (See Law of identity).\n\nThe rules of the L-system grammar are applied iteratively starting from the initial state. As many rules as possible are applied simultaneously, per iteration. The fact that each iteration employs as many rules as possible differentiates an L-system from a formal language generated by a formal grammar, which applies only one rule per iteration. If the production rules were to be applied only one at a time, one would quite simply generate a language, rather than an L-system. Thus, L-systems are strict subsets of languages.\n\nAn L-system is context-free if each production rule refers only to an individual symbol and not to its neighbours. Context-free L-systems are thus specified by a context-free grammar. If a rule depends not only on a single symbol but also on its neighbours, it is termed a context-sensitive L-system.\n\nIf there is exactly one production for each symbol, then the L-system is said to be deterministic (a deterministic context-free L-system is popularly called a D0L system). If there are several, and each is chosen with a certain probability during each iteration, then it is a stochastic L-system.\n\nUsing L-systems for generating graphical images requires that the symbols in the model refer to elements of a drawing on the computer screen. For example, the program Fractint uses turtle graphics (similar to those in the Logo programming language) to produce screen images. It interprets each constant in an L-system model as a turtle command.\n\nExamples of L-systems\n\nExample 1: Algae\nLindenmayer's original L-system for modelling the growth of algae.\n\nvariables :   A B\nconstants :   none\naxiom     :   A\nrules     :   (A → AB), (B → A)\n\nwhich produces:\n\n     n = 0 : A\n     n = 1 : AB\n     n = 2 : ABA\n     n = 3 : ABAAB\n     n = 4 : ABAABABA\n     n = 5 : ABAABABAABAAB\n     n = 6 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABA\n     n = 7 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABAABAABABAABAAB\n\n Example 1: Algae, explained \n n=0:               A             start (axiom/initiator)\n                   / \\\n n=1:             A   B           the initial single A spawned into AB by rule (A → AB), rule (B → A) couldn't be applied\n                 /|     \\\n n=2:           A B      A        former string AB with all rules applied, A spawned into AB again, former B turned into A\n              / | |       | \\\n n=3:         A B A       A B     note all A's producing a copy of themselves in the first place, then a B, which turns ...\n            / | | | \\     | \\ \\\n n=4:       A B A A B     A B A   ... into an A one generation later, starting to spawn/repeat/recurse then\n\nThe result is the sequence of Fibonacci words. If we count the length of each string, we obtain the famous Fibonacci sequence of numbers (skipping the first 1, due to our choice of axiom):\n\n    1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55 89 ...\n\nFor each string, if we count the k-th position from the left end of the string, the value is determined by whether a multiple of the golden ratio falls within the interval .  The ratio of A to B likewise converges to the golden mean.\n\nThis example yields the same result (in terms of the length of each string, not the sequence of As and Bs) if the rule (A → AB) is replaced with (A → BA), except that the strings are mirrored.\n\nThis sequence is a locally catenative sequence because , where  is the n-th generation.\n\nExample 2: Fractal (binary) tree\n variables : 0, 1\n constants: [, ]\n axiom  : 0\n rules  : (1 → 11), (0 → 1[0]0)\n\nThe shape is built by recursively feeding the axiom through the production rules. Each character of the input string is checked against the rule list to determine which character or string to replace it with in the output string. In this example, a '1' in the input string becomes '11' in the output string, while '[' remains the same. Applying this to the axiom of '0', we get:\n\n axiom:  0 1st recursion:  1[0]0 2nd recursion:  11[1[0]0]1[0]0 3rd recursion:  1111[11[1[0]0]1[0]0]11[1[0]0]1[0]0 …\n\nWe can see that this string quickly grows in size and complexity. This string can be drawn as an image by using turtle graphics, where each symbol is assigned a graphical operation for the turtle to perform. For example, in the sample above, the turtle may be given the following instructions:\n\n 0: draw a line segment ending in a leaf\n 1: draw a line segment\n [: push position and angle, turn left 45 degrees\n ]: pop position and angle, turn right 45 degrees\n\nThe push and pop refer to a LIFO stack (more technical grammar would have separate symbols for \"push position\" and \"turn left\"). When the turtle interpretation encounters a '[', the current position and angle are saved, and are then restored when the interpretation encounters a ']'. If multiple values have been \"pushed,\" then a \"pop\" restores the most recently saved values. Applying the graphical rules listed above to the earlier recursion, we get:\n\nExample 3: Cantor set\n450px|right\n     variables :   A B\n     constants :   none\n     start     :   A   {starting character string}\n     rules     :   (A → ABA), (B → BBB)\n\nLet A mean \"draw forward\" and B mean \"move forward\".\n\nThis produces the famous Cantor's fractal set on a real straight line R.\n\nExample 4: Koch curve\nA variant of the Koch curve which uses only right angles.\n\n variables :   F\n constants :   + −\n start     :   F\n rules     :   (F → F+F−F−F+F)\n\nHere, F means \"draw forward\", + means \"turn left 90°\", and − means \"turn right 90°\" (see turtle graphics).\n\n n = 0:\n F\n Koch Square - 0 iterations\n\n n = 1:\n F+F−F−F+F\n Koch Square - 1 iterations\n\n n = 2:\n F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F\n Koch Square - 2 iterations\n\n n = 3:\n F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F+\nF+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−\n F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−\n F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F+\n F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F\n Koch Square - 3 iterations\n\nExample 5: Sierpinski triangle\nThe Sierpinski triangle drawn using an L-system.\n\n     variables :   F G\n     constants :   + −\n     start     :   F−G−G\n     rules     :   (F → F−G+F+G−F), (G → GG)\n     angle     :   120°\n\nHere, F and G both mean \"draw forward\", + means \"turn left by angle\", and − means \"turn right by angle\".\n\nIt is also possible to approximate the Sierpinski triangle using a Sierpiński arrowhead curve L-system.\n\n     variables :   A B\n     constants :   + −\n     start     :   A\n     rules     :   (A → B−A−B), (B → A+B+A)\n     angle     :   60°\n\nHere, A and B both mean \"draw forward\", + means \"turn left by angle\", and − means \"turn right by angle\" (see turtle graphics).\n\ncentre\nEvolution for n = 2, n = 4, n = 6, n = 8\n\nExample 6: Dragon curve \nThe dragon curve drawn using an L-system.\n\n     variables :   X Y\n     constants :   F + −\n     start     :   FX\n     rules     :   (X → X+YF+), (Y → −FX−Y)\n     angle     :   90°\n\nHere, F means \"draw forward\", − means \"turn left 90°\", and + means \"turn right 90°\".

The square bracket \"[\" corresponds to saving the current values for position and angle, which are restored when the corresponding \"]\" is executed.\n\ncentre\n\nFractal plant for n = 6\n\nVariations\nA number of elaborations on this basic L-system technique have been developed which can be used in conjunction with each other. Among these are stochastic grammars, context sensitive grammars, and parametric grammars.\n\nStochastic grammars\nThe grammar model we have discussed thus far has been deterministic—that is, given any symbol in the grammar's alphabet, there has been exactly one production rule, which is always chosen, and always performs the same conversion. One alternative is to specify more than one production rule for a symbol, giving each a probability of occurring. For example, in the grammar of Example 2, we could change the rule for rewriting \"0\" from:\n\n0 → 1[0]0\n\nto a probabilistic rule:\n\n0 (0.5) → 1[0]0\n0 (0.5) → 0\n\nUnder this production, whenever a \"0\" is encountered during string rewriting, there would be a 50% chance it would behave as previously described, and a 50% chance it would not change during production. When a stochastic grammar is used in an evolutionary context, it is advisable to incorporate a random seed into the genotype, so that the stochastic properties of the image remain constant between generations.\n\nContext sensitive grammars\nA context sensitive production rule looks not only at the symbol it is modifying, but the symbols on the string appearing before and after it. For instance, the production rule:\n\nb < a > c → aa\n\ntransforms \"a\" to \"aa\", but only If the \"a\" occurs between a \"b\" and a \"c\" in the input string:\n\n…bac…\n\nAs with stochastic productions, there are multiple productions to handle symbols in different contexts. If no production rule can be found for a given context, the identity production is assumed, and the symbol does not change on transformation. If context-sensitive and context-free productions both exist within the same grammar, the context-sensitive production is assumed to take precedence when it is applicable.\n\nParametric grammars\nIn a parametric grammar, each symbol in the alphabet has a parameter list associated with it. A symbol coupled with its parameter list is called a module, and a string in a parametric grammar is a series of modules. An example string might be:\n\na(0,1)[b(0,0)]a(1,2)\n\nThe parameters can be used by the drawing functions, and also by the production rules. The production rules can use the parameters in two ways: first, in a conditional statement determining whether the rule will apply, and second, the production rule can modify the actual parameters. For example, look at:\n\na(x,y) : x == 0 → a(1, y+1)b(2,3)\n\nThe module a(x,y) undergoes transformation under this production rule if the conditional x=0 is met. For example, a(0,2) would undergo transformation, and a(1,2) would not.\n\nIn the transformation portion of the production rule, the parameters as well as entire modules can be affected. In the above example, the module b(x,y) is added to the string, with initial parameters (2,3). Also, the parameters of the already existing module are transformed. Under the above production rule,\n\na(0,2)\n\nBecomes\n\na(1,3)b(2,3)\n\nas the \"x\" parameter of a(x,y) is explicitly transformed to a \"1\" and the \"y\" parameter of a is incremented by one.\n\nParametric grammars allow line lengths and branching angles to be determined by the grammar, rather than the turtle interpretation methods. Also, if age is given as a parameter for a module, rules can change depending on the age of a plant segment, allowing animations of the entire life-cycle of the tree to be created.\n\nBi-directional grammars\nThe bi-directional model explicitly separates the symbolic rewriting system from the shape assignment. For example, the string rewriting process in the Example 2 (Fractal tree) is independent on how graphical operations are assigned to the symbols. In other words, an infinite number of draw methods are applicable to a given rewriting system.\n\nThe bi-directional model consists of 1) a forward process constructs the derivation tree with production rules, and 2) a backward process realizes the tree with shapes in a stepwise manner (from leaves to the root). Each inverse-derivation step involves essential geometric-topological reasoning. With this bi-directional framework, design constraints and objectives are encoded in the grammar-shape translation. In architectural design applications, the bi-directional grammar features consistent interior connectivity and a rich spatial hierarchyHua, H., 2017, December.

      "text": "In mathematical logic, Löb's theorem states that in Peano arithmetic (PA) (or any formal system including PA), for any formula P, if it is provable in PA that \"if P is provable in PA then P is true\", then P is provable in PA. More formally, if Prov(P) means that the formula P is provable, then\n\nor\n\nAn immediate corollary of Löb's theorem is that, if P is not provable in PA, then \"if P is provable in PA, then P is true\" is not provable in PA. For example, \"If  is provable in PA, then \" is not provable in PA.\n\nLöb's theorem is named for Martin Hugo Löb, who formulated it in 1955.\n\nLöb's theorem in provability logic\nProvability logic abstracts away from the details of encodings used in Gödel's incompleteness theorems by expressing the provability of  in the given system in the language of modal logic, by means of the modality .\n\nThen we can formalize Löb's theorem by the axiom\n\nknown as axiom GL, for Gödel-Löb. This is sometimes formalised by means of an inference rule that infers\n\nfrom\n\nThe provability logic GL that results from taking the modal logic K4 (or K, since the axiom schema 4, , then becomes redundant) and adding the above axiom GL is the most intensely investigated system in provability logic.\n\nModal proof of Löb's theorem\nLöb's theorem can be proved within modal logic using only some basic rules about the provability operator (the K4 system) plus the existence of modal fixed points.\n\nModal formulas\nWe will assume the following grammar for formulas:\n If  is a propositional variable, then  is a formula.\n If  is a propositional constant, then  is a formula.\n If  is a formula, then  is a formula.\n If  and  are formulas, then so are , , , , and \n\nA modal sentence is a modal formula that contains no propositional variables. We use  to mean  is a theorem.\n\nModal fixed points\nIf  is a modal formula with only one propositional variable , then a modal fixed point of  is a sentence  such that\n\nWe will assume the existence of such fixed points for every modal formula with one free variable. This is of course not an obvious thing to assume, but if we interpret  as provability in Peano Arithmetic, then the existence of modal fixed points is in fact true.\n\nModal rules of inference\nIn addition to the existence of modal fixed points, we assume the following rules of inference for the provability operator :\n\n (necessitation) From  conclude : Informally, this says that if A is a theorem, then it is provable.\n (internal necessitation) : If A is provable, then it is provable that it is provable.\n (box distributivity) :  This rule allows you to do modus ponens inside the provability operator. If it is provable that A implies B, and A is provable, then B is provable.\n\nProof of Löb's theorem\n\n Assume that there is a modal sentence  such that .Roughly speaking, it is a theorem that if  is provable, then it is, in fact true.This is a claim of soundness.\n From the existence of modal fixed points for every formula (in particular, the formula ) it follows there exists a sentence  such that .\n From 2, it follows that .\n From the necessitation rule, it follows that .\n From 4 and the box distributivity rule, it follows that .\n Applying the box distributivity rule with  and  gives us .\n From 5 and 6, it follows that .\n From the internal necessitation rule, it follows that .\n From 7 and 8, it follows that .\n From 1 and 9, it follows that .\n From 2, it follows that . \n From 10 and 11, it follows that \n From 12 and the necessitation rule, it follows that .\n From 13 and 10, it follows that .\n\nExamples\nAn immediate corollary of Löb's theorem is that, if P is not provable in PA, then \"if P is provable in PA, then P is true\" is not provable in PA. Given we know PA is consistent (but PA does not know PA is consistent), here are some simple examples:\n \"If  is provable in PA, then \" is not provable in PA, as  is not provable in PA (as it is false).\n \"If  is provable in PA, then \" is provable in PA, as is any statement of the form \"If X, then \".\n \"If the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is provable in PA, then the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true\" is not provable in PA, as \"The strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true\" is not provable in PA (despite being true).\n\nIn Doxastic logic, Löb's theorem shows that any system classified as a reflexive \"type 4\" reasoner must also be \"modest\": such a reasoner can never believe \"my belief in P would imply that P is true\", without first believing that P is true.Smullyan, Raymond M., (1986) Logicians who reason about themselves, Proceedings of the 1986 conference on Theoretical aspects of reasoning about knowledge, Monterey (CA), Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco (CA), pp. 341-352\n\nConverse: Löb's theorem implies the existence of modal fixed points\nNot only does the existence of modal fixed points imply Löb's theorem, but the converse is valid, too.  When Löb's theorem is given as an axiom (schema), the existence of a fixed point (up to provable equivalence)  for any formula A(p) modalized in p can be derived.  Thus in normal modal logic, Löb's axiom is equivalent to the conjunction of the axiom schema 4,  and the existence of modal fixed points.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n Löb's theorem at PlanetMath\n The Cartoon Guide to Löb’s Theorem by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n\nCategory:Mathematical logic\nCategory:Modal logic\nCategory:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics\nCategory:Metatheorems\nCategory:Provability logic\nCategory:Mathematical axioms"

      "title": "Machine that always halts",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_that_always_halts",
      "text": "In computability theory, a machine that always halts, also called a deciderSipser, 1996 or a total Turing machine,Kozen, 1997 is a Turing machine that eventually halts for every input.\n\nBecause it always halts, such a machine is able to decide whether a given string is a member of a formal language.  The class of languages which can be decided by such machines is exactly the set of recursive languages. However, the halting problem, determining whether an arbitrary Turing machine halts on a given input, is itself an undecidable problem.\n\n Functions computable by total Turing machines \n\nIn practice, many functions of interest are computable by machines that always halt.   A machine that uses only finite memory on any particular input can be forced to halt for every input by restricting its flow control capabilities so that no input will ever cause the machine to enter an infinite loop.  As a trivial example, a machine implementing a finitary decision tree will always halt.\n\nIt is not required that the machine be entirely free of looping capabilities, however, to guarantee halting.  If we restrict loops to be of a predictably finite size (like the FOR loop in BASIC), we can express all of the primitive recursive functions (Meyer and Ritchie, 1967). An example of such a machine is provided by the toy programming language PL-{GOTO} of Brainerd and Landweber (1974).\n\nWe can further define a programming language in which we can ensure that even more sophisticated functions always halt.  For example, the Ackermann function, which is not primitive recursive, nevertheless is a total computable function computable by a term rewriting system with a reduction ordering on its arguments (Ohlebusch, 2002, pp. 67).\n\nDespite the above examples of programming languages which guarantee termination of the programs, there exists no programming language which captures exactly the recursive functions, i.e. the functions which can be computed by a Turing machine that always halts. This is because existence of such a programming language would be a contradiction to the non-semi-decidability of the problem whether a Turing machine halts on every input.\n\n Relationship to partial Turing machines \n\nA general Turing machine will compute a partial function.  Two questions can be asked about the relationship between partial Turing machines and total Turing machines:\n Can every partial function computable by a partial Turing machine be extended (that is, have its domain enlarged) to become a total computable function?\n Is it possible to change the definition of a Turing machine so that a particular class of total Turing machines, computing all the total computable functions, can be found?\nThe answer to each of these questions is no.\n\nThe following theorem shows that the functions computable by machines that always halt do not include extensions of all partial computable functions, which implies the first question above has a negative answer.   This fact is closely related to the algorithmic unsolvability of the Halting problem.\n\nTheorem.''' There are Turing computable partial functions that have no extension to a total Turing computable function.  In particular, the partial function f defined so that f(n) = m if and only if the Turing machine with index n halts on input 0 with output m has no extension to a total computable function.\n\nIndeed, if g were a total computable function extending f then g would be computable by some Turing machine; fix e as the index of such a machine.   Build a Turing machine M, using Kleene's recursion theorem, which on input 0 simulates the machine with index e running on an index nM for M (thus the machine M can produce an index of itself; this is the role of the recursion theorem).   By assumption, this simulation will eventually return an answer. Define M so that if g(nM) = m then the return value of M is m + 1.  Thus f(nM), the true return value of M on input 0, will not equal g(nM).  Hence g does not extend f.\n\nThe second question asks, in essence, whether there is another reasonable model of computation which computes only total functions and computes all the total computable functions.  Informally, if such a model existed then each of its computers could be simulated by a Turing machine.  Thus if this new model of computation consisted of a sequence  of machines, there would be a recursively enumerable sequence  of Turing machines that compute total functions and so that every total computable function is computable by one of the machines Ti.  This is impossible, because a machine  could be constructed such that on input i the machine T returns .  This machine cannot be equivalent to any machine T on the list: suppose it were on the list at index j.  Then , which does not return an integer result.  Therefore, it cannot be total, but the function by construction must be total (if total functions are recursively enumerable, then this function can be constructed), which is a contradiction.  This shows that the second question has a negative answer.\n\n The set of indices of total Turing machines \n\nThe decision problem of whether the Turing machine with index e will halt on every input is not decidable.  In fact, this problem is at level  of the arithmetical hierarchy.  Thus this problem is strictly more difficult than the Halting problem, which asks whether the machine with index e halts on input 0.   Intuitively, this difference in unsolvability is because each instance of the \"total machine\" problem represents infinitely many instances of the Halting problem.\n\n Provability \n\nOne may be interested not only in whether a Turing machine is total, but also in whether this can be proven in a certain logical system, such as first order Peano arithmetic.\n\nIn a sound proof system, every provably total Turing machine is indeed total, but the converse is not true: informally, for every first-order proof system that is strong enough (including Peano arithmetic), there are Turing machines which are assumed to be total, but cannot be proven as such, unless the system is inconsistent (in which case one can prove anything). The proof of their totality either rests on some assumptions or require another proof system.\n\nThus, as one can enumerate all the proofs in the proof system, one can build a Turing machine on input n that goes through the first n proofs and look for a contradiction. If it finds one, it gets into an infinite loop and never halts; otherwise, it halts. If the system is consistent, the Turing machine will halt on every input, but one cannot prove this in a strong enough proof system due to Gödel's incompleteness theorems.\n\nOne can also create a Turing machine that will halt if and only if the proof system is inconsistent, and is thus non-total for a consistent system but cannot be proven such: This is a Turing machine that, regardless of input, enumerates all proofs and halts on a contradiction.\n\nA Turing machine that goes through Goodstein sequences and halts at zero is total but cannot be proven as such in Peano arithmetic.\n\n See also \n BlooP and FlooP\n Total functional programming\n\n References \n\n Brainerd, W.S., Landweber, L.H.

      "text": "In physics and cosmology, the mathematical universe hypothesis (MUH), also known as the ultimate ensemble theory, is a speculative \"theory of everything\" (TOE) proposed by cosmologist Max Tegmark.M. Tegmark 2014, \"Our Mathematical Universe\", Knopf\n\nDescription\nTegmark's MUH is: Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure.  That is, the physical universe is not merely described by mathematics, but is mathematics (specifically, a mathematical structure).  Mathematical existence equals physical existence, and all structures that exist mathematically exist physically as well.  Observers, including humans, are \"self-aware substructures (SASs)\".  In any mathematical structure complex enough to contain such substructures, they \"will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world\".Tegmark (1998), p. 1.\n\nThe theory can be considered a form of Pythagoreanism or Platonism in that it proposes the existence of mathematical entities; a form of mathematical monism in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects; and a formal expression of ontic structural realism.\n\nTegmark claims that the hypothesis has no free parameters and is not observationally ruled out. Thus, he reasons, it is preferred over other theories-of-everything by Occam's Razor.  Tegmark also considers augmenting the MUH with a second assumption, the computable universe hypothesis (CUH), which says that the mathematical structure that is our external physical reality is defined by computable functions.\n\nThe MUH is related to Tegmark's categorization of four levels of the multiverse.  This categorization posits a nested hierarchy of increasing diversity, with worlds corresponding to different sets of initial conditions (level 1), physical constants (level 2), quantum branches (level 3), and altogether different equations or mathematical structures (level 4).\n\nReception\n\nAndreas Albrecht of Imperial College in London, called it a \"provocative\" solution to one of the central problems facing physics. Although he \"wouldn't dare\" go so far as to say he believes it, he noted that \"it's actually quite difficult to construct a theory where everything we see is all there is\".\n\nCriticisms and responses\n\nDefinition of the ensemble\nJürgen SchmidhuberJ. Schmidhuber (2000) \"Algorithmic Theories of Everything.\" argues that \"Although Tegmark suggests that '... all mathematical structures are a priori given equal statistical weight,' there is no way of assigning equal non-vanishing probability to all (infinitely many) mathematical structures.\" Schmidhuber puts forward a more restricted ensemble which admits only universe representations describable by constructive mathematics, that is, computer programs; e.g., the Global Digital Mathematics Library and Digital Library of Mathematical Functions, linked open data representations of formalized fundamental theorems intended to serve as building blocks for additional mathematical results. He explicitly includes universe representations describable by non-halting programs whose output bits converge after finite time, although the convergence time itself may not be predictable by a halting program, due to the undecidability of the halting problem.\n\nIn response, Tegmark notes (sec. V.E) that a constructive mathematics formalized measure of variations of physical constants and laws over all universes has not yet been constructed for the string theory landscape either, so this should not be regarded as a \"show-stopper\".\n\nConsistency with Gödel's theorem\n\nIt has also been suggested that the MUH is inconsistent with Gödel's incompleteness theorem. In a three-way debate between Tegmark and fellow physicists Piet Hut and Mark Alford, the \"secularist\" (Alford) states that \"the methods allowed by formalists cannot prove all the theorems in a sufficiently powerful system... The idea that math is 'out there' is incompatible with the idea that it consists of formal systems.\"\n\nTegmark's response in (sec VI.A.1) is to offer a new hypothesis \"that only Gödel-complete (fully decidable) mathematical structures have physical existence. This drastically shrinks the Level IV multiverse, essentially placing an upper limit on complexity, and may have the attractive side effect of explaining the relative simplicity of our universe.\" Tegmark goes on to note that although conventional theories in physics are Gödel-undecidable, the actual mathematical structure describing our world could still be Gödel-complete, and \"could in principle contain observers capable of thinking about Gödel-incomplete mathematics, just as finite-state digital computers can prove certain theorems about Gödel-incomplete formal systems like Peano arithmetic.\" In (sec. VII) he gives a more detailed response, proposing as an alternative to MUH the more restricted \"Computable Universe Hypothesis\" (CUH) which only includes mathematical structures that are simple enough that Gödel's theorem does not require them to contain any undecidable or uncomputable theorems. Tegmark admits that this approach faces \"serious challenges\", including (a) it excludes much of the mathematical landscape; (b) the measure on the space of allowed theories may itself be uncomputable; and (c) \"virtually all historically successful theories of physics violate the CUH\".\n\nObservability\nStoeger, Ellis, and KircherW. R. Stoeger, G. F. R. Ellis, U. Kirchner (2006) \"Multiverses and Cosmology: Philosophical Issues.\" (sec. 7) note that in a true multiverse theory, \"the universes are then completely disjoint and nothing that happens in any one of them is causally linked to what happens in any other one. This lack of any causal connection in such multiverses really places them beyond any scientific support\". EllisG.F.R. Ellis, \"83 years of general relativity and cosmology: Progress and problems\", Class. Quantum Grav. 16, A37-A75, 1999 (p29) specifically criticizes the MUH, stating that an infinite ensemble of completely disconnected universes is \"completely untestable, despite hopeful remarks sometimes made, see, e.g., Tegmark (1998).\"\nTegmark maintains that MUH is testable, stating that it predicts (a) that \"physics research will uncover mathematical regularities in nature\", and (b) by assuming that we occupy a typical member of the multiverse of mathematical structures, one could \"start testing multiverse predictions by assessing how typical our universe is\" ( sec. VIII.C).\n\nPlausibility of radical Platonism\n\nThe MUH is based on the Radical Platonist view that math is an external reality ( sec V.C). However, JannesGil Jannes, \"Some comments on 'The Mathematical Universe'\", Found. Phys. 39, 397-406, 2009 arXiv:0904.0867 argues that \"mathematics is at least in part a human construction\", on the basis that if it is an external reality, then it should be found in some other animals as well: \"Tegmark argues that, if we want to give a complete description of reality, then we will need a language independent of us humans, understandable for non-human sentient entities, such as aliens and future supercomputers\". Brian Greene (B. Greene 2011, \"The Hidden Reality \" p. 299) argues similarly: \"The deepest description of the universe should not require concepts whose meaning relies on human  experience or interpretation. Reality transcends our existence and so shouldn't, in any fundamental way, depend on ideas of our making.\"\n\nHowever, there are many non-human entities, plenty of which are intelligent, and many of which can apprehend, memorise, compare and even approximately add numerical quantities. Several animals have also passed the mirror test of self-consciousness. But a few surprising examples of mathematical abstraction notwithstanding (for example, chimpanzees can be trained to carry out symbolic addition with digits, or the report of a parrot understanding a “zero-like concept”), all examples of animal intelligence with respect to mathematics are limited to basic counting abilities. He adds, \"non-human intelligent beings should exist that understand the language of advanced mathematics. However, none of the non-human intelligent beings that we know of confirm the status of (advanced) mathematics as an objective language.\" In the paper \"On Math, Matter and Mind\" the secularist viewpoint examined argues (sec. VI.A) that math is evolving over time, there is \"no reason to think it is converging to a definite structure, with fixed questions and established ways to address them\", and also that \"The Radical Platonist position is just another metaphysical theory like solipsism... In the end the metaphysics just demands that we use a different language for saying what we already knew.\"  Tegmark responds (sec VI.A.1) that \"The notion of a mathematical structure is rigorously defined in any book on Model Theory\", and that non-human mathematics would only differ from our own \"because we are uncovering a different part of what is in fact a consistent and unified picture, so math is converging in this sense.\" In his 2014 book on the MUH,M. Tegmark 2014, \"Our Mathematical Universe\" Tegmark argues that the resolution is not that we invent the language of mathematics, but that we discover the structure of mathematics.\n\nCoexistence of all mathematical structures\nDon Page has arguedD. Page, \"Predictions and Tests of Multiverse Theories.\" (sec 4) that \"At the ultimate level, there can be only one world and, if mathematical structures are broad enough to include all possible worlds or at least our own, there must be one unique mathematical structure that describes ultimate reality. So I think it is logical nonsense to talk of Level 4 in the sense of the co-existence of all mathematical structures.\" This means there can only be one mathematical corpus, as represented by the emergent linked open data representations of formalized fundamental theorems, e.g., Global Digital Mathematics Library and Digital Library of Mathematical Functions. Tegmark responds ( sec. V.E) that \"this is less inconsistent with Level IV than it may sound, since many mathematical structures decompose into unrelated substructures, and separate ones can be unified.\"\n\nConsistency with our \"simple universe\"\nAlexander Vilenkin commentsA. Vilenkin (2006) Many Worlds in One: The Search for Other Universes. Hill and Wang, New York. (Ch. 19, p. 203) that \"the number of mathematical structures increases with increasing complexity, suggesting that 'typical' structures should be horrendously large and cumbersome. This seems to be in conflict with the beauty and simplicity of the theories describing our world\". He goes on to note (footnote 8, p. 222) that Tegmark's solution to this problem, the assigning of lower \"weights\" to the more complex structures ( sec. V.B) seems arbitrary (\"Who determines the weights?\") and may not be logically consistent (\"It seems to introduce an additional mathematical structure, but all of them are supposed to be already included in the set\").\n\nOccam's razor\nTegmark has been criticized as misunderstanding the nature and application of Occam's razor; Massimo Pigliucci reminds that \"Occam's razor is just a useful heuristic, it should never be used as the final arbiter to decide which theory is to be favored\".\n\nMajor books\nOur Mathematical Universe: written by Max Tegmark and published on January 7, 2014, this book describes Tegmark's theory.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nSchmidhuber, J.

He describes his Hegelian period and includes hitherto unpublished notes for a Hegelian philosophy of science.  He deals next with the two-fold revolution involved with his abandonment of idealism and adoption of a mathematical logic founded upon that of Giuseppe Peano.  After two chapters on Principia Mathematica (1910-1913), he passes to the problems of perception as dealt with in Our Knowledge of the External World (1914).  In a chapter on ‘The Impact of Wittgenstein’, Russell examines what he now thinks must be accepted and what rejected in that philosopher’s work.  He notes the changes from earlier theories required by the adoption of William James’s view that sensation is not essentially relational and is not per se a form of knowledge. In an explanatory chapter, he endeavours to remove misconceptions of and objections to his theories as to the relation of perception to scientific knowledge. Russell concludes with a reprint of some articles on modern Oxford philosophy.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1959 books\nCategory:Allen & Unwin books\nCategory:Biographies and autobiographies of mathematicians\nCategory:Books by Bertrand Russell\nCategory:English-language books"

      "text": "In proof theory, ordinal analysis assigns ordinals (often large countable ordinals) to mathematical theories as a measure of their strength. The field was formed when Gerhard Gentzen in 1934 used cut elimination to prove, in modern terms, that the proof-theoretic ordinal of Peano arithmetic is ε0.\n\nDefinition\nOrdinal analysis concerns true, effective (recursive) theories that can interpret a sufficient portion of arithmetic to make statements about ordinal notations. The proof-theoretic ordinal of such a theory   is the smallest recursive ordinal that the theory cannot prove is well founded—the supremum of all ordinals  for which there exists a notation  in Kleene's sense such that  proves that  is an ordinal notation. Equivalently, it is the supremum of all ordinals  such that there exists a recursive relation  on  (the set of natural numbers) that well-orders it with ordinal  and such that  proves transfinite induction of arithmetical statements for .\n\nThe existence of any recursive ordinal that the theory fails to prove is well ordered follows from the  bounding theorem, as the set of natural numbers that an effective theory proves to be ordinal notations is a  set (see Hyperarithmetical theory).  Thus the proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory will always be a countable ordinal less than the Church–Kleene ordinal .\n\nIn practice, the proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory is a good measure of the strength of a theory. If theories have the same proof-theoretic ordinal they are often equiconsistent, and if one theory has a larger proof-theoretic ordinal than another it can often prove the consistency of the second theory.\n\nExamples\n\nTheories with proof-theoretic ordinal ω2\nRFA, rudimentary function arithmetic. defines the rudimentary sets and rudimentary functions, and proves them equivalent to the Δ0-predicates on the naturals.

      "text": "thumb|300px|Representation of the ordinal numbers up to ωω. Each turn of the spiral represents one power of ω\nIn set theory, an ordinal number, or ordinal, is one generalization of the concept of a natural number that is used to describe a way to arrange a collection of objects in order, one after another.  Any finite collection of objects can be put in order just by the process of counting: labeling the objects with distinct natural numbers.  Ordinal numbers are thus the \"labels\" needed to arrange collections of objects in order.\n\nAn ordinal number is used to describe the order type of a well-ordered set (though this does not work for a well-ordered proper class). A well-ordered set is a set with a relation > such that\n Trichotomy For any elements x and y, exactly one of these statements is true\n Transitivity For any elements x, y, z, if x > y and y > z, then x > z\n Well-foundedness Every non-empty subset has a least element, that is, it has an element x such that there is no other element y in the subset where x > y\n\nTwo well-ordered sets have the same order type if and only if there is a bijection from one set to the other that converts the relation in the first set to the relation in the second set.\n\nWhereas ordinals are useful for ordering the objects in a collection, they are distinct from cardinal numbers, which are useful for saying how many objects are in a collection. Although the distinction between ordinals and cardinals is not always apparent in finite sets (one can go from one to the other just by counting labels), different infinite ordinals can describe the same cardinal.  Like other kinds of numbers, ordinals can be added, multiplied, and exponentiated, although the addition and multiplication are not commutative.\n\nOrdinals were introduced by Georg Cantor in 1883Thorough introductions are given by  and . to accommodate infinite sequences and to classify derived sets, which he had previously introduced in 1872 while studying the uniqueness of trigonometric series.. See the footnote on p. 12.\n\n Ordinals extend the natural numbers \n\nA natural number (which, in this context, includes the number 0) can be used for two purposes: to describe the size of a set, or to describe the position of an element in a sequence.  When restricted to finite sets these two concepts coincide, there is only one way to put a finite set into a linear sequence, up to isomorphism.  When dealing with infinite sets one has to distinguish between the notion of size, which leads to cardinal numbers, and the notion of position, which is generalized by the ordinal numbers described here.  This is because while any set has only one size (its cardinality), there are many nonisomorphic well-orderings of any infinite set, as explained below.\n\nWhereas the notion of cardinal number is associated with a set with no particular structure on it, the ordinals are intimately linked with the special kind of sets that are called well-ordered (so intimately linked, in fact, that some mathematicians make no distinction between the two concepts). A well-ordered set is a totally ordered set (given any two elements one defines a smaller and a larger one in a coherent way) in which there is no infinite decreasing sequence (however, there may be infinite increasing sequences); equivalently, every non-empty subset of the set has a least element. Ordinals may be used to label the elements of any given well-ordered set (the smallest element being labelled 0, the one after that 1, the next one 2, \"and so on\") and to measure the \"length\" of the whole set by the least ordinal that is not a label for an element of the set.  This \"length\" is called the order type of the set.\n\nAny ordinal is defined by the set of ordinals that precede it: in fact, the most common definition of ordinals identifies each ordinal as the set of ordinals that precede it.  For example, the ordinal 42 is the order type of the ordinals less than it, i.e., the ordinals from 0 (the smallest of all ordinals) to 41 (the immediate predecessor of 42), and it is generally identified as the set .  Conversely, any set S of ordinals that is downward-closed — meaning that for any ordinal α in S and any ordinal β < α, β is also in S — is (or can be identified with) an ordinal.\n\nThere are infinite ordinals as well: the smallest infinite ordinal is ω, which is the order type of the natural numbers (finite ordinals) and that can even be identified with the set of natural numbers (indeed, the set of natural numbers is well-ordered—as is any set of ordinals—and since it is downward closed it can be identified with the ordinal associated with it, which is exactly how ω is defined).\n\nthumb|right|256px|A graphical \"matchstick\" representation of the ordinal ω². Each stick corresponds to an ordinal of the form ω·m+n where m and n are natural numbers.\n\nPerhaps a clearer intuition of ordinals can be formed by examining a first few of them: as mentioned above, they start with the natural numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …  After all natural numbers comes the first infinite ordinal, ω, and after that come ω+1, ω+2, ω+3, and so on.  (Exactly what addition means will be defined later on: just consider them as names.)  After all of these come ω·2 (which is ω+ω), ω·2+1, ω·2+2, and so on, then ω·3, and then later on ω·4.  Now the set of ordinals formed in this way (the ω·m+n, where m and n are natural numbers) must itself have an ordinal associated with it: and that is ω2.  Further on, there will be ω3, then ω4, and so on, and ωω, then ωωω, then later ωωωω, and even later ε0 (epsilon nought) (to give a few examples of relatively small—countable—ordinals).  This can be continued indefinitely far (\"indefinitely far\" is exactly what ordinals are good at: every time one says \"and so on\" when enumerating ordinals, it defines a larger ordinal). The smallest uncountable ordinal is the set of all countable ordinals, expressed as ω1.\n\n Definitions \n\n Well-ordered sets \n\nIn a well-ordered set, every non-empty subset contains a distinct smallest element.  Given the axiom of dependent choice, this is equivalent to just saying that the set is totally ordered and there is no infinite decreasing sequence, something perhaps easier to visualize. In practice, the importance of well-ordering is justified by the possibility of applying transfinite induction, which says, essentially, that any property that passes on from the predecessors of an element to that element itself must be true of all elements (of the given well-ordered set).  If the states of a computation (computer program or game) can be well-ordered in such a way that each step is followed by a \"lower\" step, then the computation will terminate.\n\nIt is inappropriate to distinguish between two well-ordered sets if they only differ in the \"labeling of their elements\", or more formally: if the elements of the first set can be paired off with the elements of the second set such that if one element is smaller than another in the first set, then the partner of the first element is smaller than the partner of the second element in the second set, and vice versa.  Such a one-to-one correspondence is called an order isomorphism and the two well-ordered sets are said to be order-isomorphic, or similar (obviously this is an equivalence relation).  Provided there exists an order isomorphism between two well-ordered sets, the order isomorphism is unique: this makes it quite justifiable to consider the two sets as essentially identical, and to seek a \"canonical\" representative of the isomorphism type (class).  This is exactly what the ordinals provide, and it also provides a canonical labeling of the elements of any well-ordered set.  Formally, if a partial order < is defined on the set S, and a partial order <' is defined on the set S' , then the posets (S,<) and (S' ,<') are order isomorphic if there is a bijection f that preserves the ordering. That is, f(a) <' f(b) if and only if a < b. Every well-ordered set (S,<) is order isomorphic to the set of ordinals less than one specific ordinal number [the order type of (S,<)] under their natural ordering.\n\nEssentially, an ordinal is intended to be defined as an isomorphism class of well-ordered sets: that is, as an equivalence class for the equivalence relation of \"being order-isomorphic\".  There is a technical difficulty involved, however, in the fact that the equivalence class is too large to be a set in the usual Zermelo–Fraenkel (ZF) formalization of set theory.  But this is not a serious difficulty.  The ordinal can be said to be the order type of any set in the class.\n\n Definition of an ordinal as an equivalence class \n\nThe original definition of ordinal numbers, found for example in the Principia Mathematica, defines the order type of a well-ordering as the set of all well-orderings similar (order-isomorphic) to that well-ordering: in other words, an ordinal number is genuinely an equivalence class of well-ordered sets.  This definition must be abandoned in ZF and related systems of axiomatic set theory because these equivalence classes are too large to form a set.  However, this definition still can be used in type theory and in Quine's axiomatic set theory New Foundations and related systems (where it affords a rather surprising alternative solution to the Burali-Forti paradox of the largest ordinal).\n\n Von Neumann definition of ordinals \n\n First few von Neumann ordinals 0 =  = ∅ 1 =  =  2 =  =  3 =  =  4 =  = \nRather than defining an ordinal as an equivalence class of well-ordered sets, it will be defined as a particular well-ordered set that (canonically) represents the class.  Thus, an ordinal number will be a well-ordered set; and every well-ordered set will be order-isomorphic to exactly one ordinal number.\n\nThe standard definition, suggested by John von Neumann and now called definition of von Neumann ordinals, is: \"each ordinal is the well-ordered set of all smaller ordinals.\" In symbols, λ = [0,λ). attributes the idea to unpublished work of Zermelo in 1916 and several papers by von Neumann the 1920s. Formally:\n\nA set S is an ordinal if and only if S is strictly well-ordered with respect to set membership and every element of S is also a subset of S.\n\nThe natural numbers are thus ordinals by this definition. For instance, 2 is an element of 4 = , and 2 is equal to  and so it is a subset of .\n\nIt can be shown by transfinite induction that every well-ordered set is order-isomorphic to exactly one of these ordinals, that is, there is an order preserving bijective function between them.\n\nFurthermore, the elements of every ordinal are ordinals themselves. Given two ordinals S and T, S is an element of T if and only if S is a proper subset of T. Moreover, either S is an element of T, or T is an element of S, or they are equal. So every set of ordinals is totally ordered. Further, every set of ordinals is well-ordered. This generalizes the fact that every set of natural numbers is well-ordered.\n\nConsequently, every ordinal S is a set having as elements precisely the ordinals smaller than S. For example, every set of ordinals has a supremum, the ordinal obtained by taking the union of all the ordinals in the set. This union exists regardless of the set's size, by the axiom of union.\n\nThe class of all ordinals is not a set. If it were a set, one could show that it was an ordinal and thus a member of itself, which would contradict its strict ordering by membership. This is the Burali-Forti paradox. The class of all ordinals is variously called \"Ord\", \"ON\", or \"∞\".\n\nAn ordinal is finite if and only if the opposite order is also well-ordered, which is the case if and only if each of its subsets has a maximum.\n\n Other definitions \n\nThere are other modern formulations of the definition of ordinal. For example, assuming the axiom of regularity, the following are equivalent for a set x:\nx is an ordinal,\nx is a transitive set, and set membership is trichotomous on x,\nx is a transitive set totally ordered by set inclusion,\nx is a transitive set of transitive sets.\nThese definitions cannot be used in non-well-founded set theories. In set theories with urelements, one has to further make sure that the definition excludes urelements from appearing in ordinals.\n\nTransfinite sequence\nIf α is a limit ordinal and X is a set, an α-indexed sequence of elements of X is a function from α to X.  This concept, a transfinite sequence or ordinal-indexed sequence, is a generalization of the concept of a sequence. An ordinary sequence corresponds to the case α = ω.\n\n Transfinite induction \n\nTransfinite induction holds in any well-ordered set, but it is so important in relation to ordinals that it is worth restating here.\n\n Any property that passes from the set of ordinals smaller than a given ordinal α to α itself, is true of all ordinals.\n\nThat is, if P(α) is true whenever P(β) is true for all , then P(α) is true for all α.  Or, more practically: in order to prove a property P for all ordinals α, one can assume that it is already known for all smaller .\n\n Transfinite recursion \n\nTransfinite induction can be used not only to prove things, but also to define them. Such a definition is normally said to be by transfinite recursion – the proof that the result is well-defined uses transfinite induction. Let F denote a (class) function F to be defined on the ordinals. The idea now is that, in defining F(α) for an unspecified ordinal α, one may assume that F(β) is already defined for all  and thus give a formula for F(α) in terms of these F(β). It then follows by transfinite induction that there is one and only one function satisfying the recursion formula up to and including α.\n\nHere is an example of definition by transfinite recursion on the ordinals (more will be given later): define function F by letting F(α) be the smallest ordinal not in the set , that is, the set consisting of all F(β) for . This definition assumes the F(β) known in the very process of defining F; this apparent vicious circle is exactly what definition by transfinite recursion permits. In fact, F(0) makes sense since there is no ordinal , and the set  is empty. So F(0) is equal to 0 (the smallest ordinal of all). Now that F(0) is known, the definition applied to F(1) makes sense (it is the smallest ordinal not in the singleton set ), and so on (the and so on is exactly transfinite induction). It turns out that this example is not very exciting, since provably  for all ordinals α, which can be shown, precisely, by transfinite induction.\n\n Successor and limit ordinals \nAny nonzero ordinal has the minimum element, zero. It may or may not have a maximum element. For example, 42 has maximum 41 and ω+6 has maximum ω+5. On the other hand, ω does not have a maximum since there is no largest natural number. If an ordinal has a maximum α, then it is the next ordinal after α, and it is called a successor ordinal, namely the successor of α, written α+1.  In the von Neumann definition of ordinals, the successor of α is  since its elements are those of α and α itself.\n\nA nonzero ordinal that is not a successor is called a limit ordinal.  One justification for this term is that a limit ordinal is the limit in a topological sense of all smaller ordinals (under the order topology).\n\nWhen  is an ordinal-indexed sequence, indexed by a limit γ and the sequence is increasing, i.e.  whenever  its limit is defined as the least upper bound of the set  that is, the smallest ordinal (it always exists) greater than any term of the sequence.  In this sense, a limit ordinal is the limit of all smaller ordinals (indexed by itself). Put more directly, it is the supremum of the set of smaller ordinals.\n\nAnother way of defining a limit ordinal is to say that α is a limit ordinal if and only if:\n\n There is an ordinal less than α and whenever ζ is an ordinal less than α, then there exists an ordinal ξ such that ζ < ξ < α.\n\nSo in the following sequence:\n\n 0, 1, 2, …, ω, ω+1\n\nω is a limit ordinal because for any smaller ordinal (in this example, a natural number) there is another ordinal (natural number) larger than it, but still less than ω.\n\nThus, every ordinal is either zero, or a successor (of a well-defined predecessor), or a limit.  This distinction is important, because many definitions by transfinite induction rely upon it.  Very often, when defining a function F by transfinite induction on all ordinals, one defines F(0), and F(α+1) assuming F(α) is defined, and then, for limit ordinals δ one defines F(δ) as the limit of the F(β) for all β<δ (either in the sense of ordinal limits, as previously explained, or for some other notion of limit if F does not take ordinal values).  Thus, the interesting step in the definition is the successor step, not the limit ordinals.  Such functions (especially for F nondecreasing and taking ordinal values) are called continuous.  Ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation are continuous as functions of their second argument.\n\n Indexing classes of ordinals \n\nAny well-ordered set is similar (order-isomorphic) to a unique ordinal number ; in other words, its elements can be indexed in increasing fashion by the ordinals less than .  This applies, in particular, to any set of ordinals: any set of ordinals is naturally indexed by the ordinals less than some .  The same holds, with a slight modification, for classes of ordinals (a collection of ordinals, possibly too large to form a set, defined by some property): any class of ordinals can be indexed by ordinals (and, when the class is unbounded in the class of all ordinals, this puts it in class-bijection with the class of all ordinals).  So the -th element in the class (with the convention that the \"0-th\" is the smallest, the \"1-st\" is the next smallest, and so on) can be freely spoken of.  Formally, the definition is by transfinite induction: the -th element of the class is defined (provided it has already been defined for all ), as the smallest element greater than the -th element for all .\n\nThis could be applied, for example, to the class of limit ordinals: the -th ordinal, which is either a limit or zero is  (see ordinal arithmetic for the definition of multiplication of ordinals).  Similarly, one can consider additively indecomposable ordinals (meaning a nonzero ordinal that is not the sum of two strictly smaller ordinals): the -th additively indecomposable ordinal is indexed as .  The technique of indexing classes of ordinals is often useful in the context of fixed points: for example, the -th ordinal  such that  is written . These are called the \"epsilon numbers\".\n\n Closed unbounded sets and classes \n\nA class  of ordinals is said to be unbounded, or cofinal, when given any ordinal , there is a  in  such that  (then the class must be a proper class, i.e., it cannot be a set).  It is said to be closed when the limit of a sequence of ordinals in the class is again in the class: or, equivalently, when the indexing (class-)function  is continuous in the sense that, for  a limit ordinal,  (the -th ordinal in the class) is the limit of all  for ; this is also the same as being closed, in the topological sense, for the order topology (to avoid talking of topology on proper classes, one can demand that the intersection of the class with any given ordinal is closed for the order topology on that ordinal, this is again equivalent).\n\nOf particular importance are those classes of ordinals that are closed and unbounded, sometimes called clubs.  For example, the class of all limit ordinals is closed and unbounded: this translates the fact that there is always a limit ordinal greater than a given ordinal, and that a limit of limit ordinals is a limit ordinal (a fortunate fact if the terminology is to make any sense at all!).  The class of additively indecomposable ordinals, or the class of  ordinals, or the class of cardinals, are all closed unbounded; the set of regular cardinals, however, is unbounded but not closed, and any finite set of ordinals is closed but not unbounded.\n\nA class is stationary if it has a nonempty intersection with every closed unbounded class.  All superclasses of closed unbounded classes are stationary, and stationary classes are unbounded, but there are stationary classes that are not closed and stationary classes that have no closed unbounded subclass (such as the class of all limit ordinals with countable cofinality).  Since the intersection of two closed unbounded classes is closed and unbounded, the intersection of a stationary class and a closed unbounded class is stationary.  But the intersection of two stationary classes may be empty, e.g. the class of ordinals with cofinality ω with the class of ordinals with uncountable cofinality.\n\nRather than formulating these definitions for (proper) classes of ordinals, one can formulate them for sets of ordinals below a given ordinal :  A subset of a limit ordinal  is said to be unbounded (or cofinal) under  provided any ordinal less than  is less than some ordinal in the set.  More generally, one can call a subset of any ordinal  cofinal in  provided every ordinal less than  is less than or equal to some ordinal in the set. The subset is said to be closed under  provided it is closed for the order topology in , i.e. a limit of ordinals in the set is either in the set or equal to  itself.\n\n Arithmetic of ordinals \n\nThere are three usual operations on ordinals: addition, multiplication, and (ordinal) exponentiation.  Each can be defined in essentially two different ways: either by constructing an explicit well-ordered set that represents the operation or by using transfinite recursion.  The Cantor normal form provides a standardized way of writing ordinals.  It uniquely represents each ordinal as a finite sum of ordinal powers of ω. However, this cannot form the basis of a universal ordinal notation due to such self-referential representations as ε0 = ωε0. The so-called \"natural\" arithmetical operations retain commutativity at the expense of continuity.\n\nInterpreted as nimbers, ordinals are also subject to nimber arithmetic operations.\n\n Ordinals and cardinals \n\n Initial ordinal of a cardinal \n\nEach ordinal associates with one cardinal, its cardinality. If there is a bijection between two ordinals (e.g.  and ), then they associate with the same cardinal. Any well-ordered set having an ordinal as its order-type has the same cardinality as that ordinal. The least ordinal associated with a given cardinal is called the initial ordinal of that cardinal. Every finite ordinal (natural number) is initial, and no other ordinal associates with its cardinal. But most infinite ordinals are not initial, as many infinite ordinals associate with the same cardinal. The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every set can be well-ordered, i.e. that every cardinal has an initial ordinal. In theories with the axiom of choice, the cardinal number of any set has an initial ordinal, and one may employ the Von Neumann cardinal assignment as the cardinal's representation. In set theories without the axiom of choice, a cardinal may be represented by the set of sets with that cardinality having minimal rank (see Scott's trick).\n\nThe α-th infinite initial ordinal is written , it is always a limit ordinal. Its cardinality is written .  For example, the cardinality of ω0 = ω is , which is also the cardinality of ω2 or ε0 (all are countable ordinals).  So ω can be identified with , except that the notation  is used when writing cardinals, and ω when writing ordinals (this is important since, for example,  =  whereas ).  Also,  is the smallest uncountable ordinal (to see that it exists, consider the set of equivalence classes of well-orderings of the natural numbers: each such well-ordering defines a countable ordinal, and  is the order type of that set),  is the smallest ordinal whose cardinality is greater than , and so on, and  is the limit of the  for natural numbers n (any limit of cardinals is a cardinal, so this limit is indeed the first cardinal after all the ).\n\n Cofinality \n\nThe cofinality of an ordinal  is the smallest ordinal  that is the order type of a cofinal subset of .  Notice that a number of authors define cofinality or use it only for limit ordinals.  The cofinality of a set of ordinals or any other well-ordered set is the cofinality of the order type of that set.\n\nThus for a limit ordinal, there exists a -indexed strictly increasing sequence with limit .  For example, the cofinality of ω² is ω, because the sequence ω·m (where m ranges over the natural numbers) tends to ω²; but, more generally, any countable limit ordinal has cofinality ω.  An uncountable limit ordinal may have either cofinality ω as does  or an uncountable cofinality.\n\nThe cofinality of 0 is 0.  And the cofinality of any successor ordinal is 1.  The cofinality of any limit ordinal is at least .\n\nAn ordinal that is equal to its cofinality is called regular and it is always an initial ordinal.  Any limit of regular ordinals is a limit of initial ordinals and thus is also initial even if it is not regular, which it usually is not.  If the Axiom of Choice, then  is regular for each α.  In this case, the ordinals 0, 1, , , and  are regular, whereas 2, 3, , and ωω·2 are initial ordinals that are not regular.\n\nThe cofinality of any ordinal α is a regular ordinal, i.e. the cofinality of the cofinality of α is the same as the cofinality of α.  So the cofinality operation is idempotent.\n\n Some \"large\" countable ordinals \n\nAs mentioned above (see Cantor normal form) the ordinal ε0, which is the smallest satisfying the equation , so it is the limit of the sequence 0, 1, , , , etc.  Many ordinals can be defined in such a manner as fixed points of certain ordinal functions (the -th ordinal such that  is called , then one could go on trying to find the -th ordinal such that , \"and so on\", but all the subtlety lies in the \"and so on\").  One could try to do this systematically, but no matter what system is used to define and construct ordinals, there is always an ordinal that lies just above all the ordinals constructed by the system.  Perhaps the most important ordinal that limits a system of construction in this manner is the Church–Kleene ordinal,  (despite the  in the name, this ordinal is countable), which is the smallest ordinal that cannot in any way be represented by a computable function (this can be made rigorous, of course).  Considerably large ordinals can be defined below , however, which measure the \"proof-theoretic strength\" of certain formal systems (for example,  measures the strength of Peano arithmetic).  Large countable ordinals can also be defined above the Church-Kleene ordinal, which are of interest in various parts of logic.\n\n Topology and ordinals \n\nAny ordinal number can be made into a topological space by endowing it with the order topology; this topology is discrete if and only if the ordinal is a countable cardinal, i.e. at most ω. A subset of ω + 1 is open in the order topology if and only if either it is cofinite or it does not contain ω as an element.\n\nSee the Topology and ordinals section of the \"Order topology\" article.\n\nDownward closed sets of ordinals\nA set is downward closed if anything less than an element of the set is also in the set. If a set of ordinals is downward closed, then that set is an ordinal—the least ordinal not in the set. \n\nExamples:\nThe set of ordinals less than 3 is 3 = , the smallest ordinal not less than 3.\nThe set of finite ordinals is infinite, the smallest infinite ordinal: ω.\nThe set of countable ordinals is uncountable, the smallest uncountable ordinal: ω1.\n\n History \nThe transfinite ordinal numbers, which first appeared in 1883,Cantor 1883. English translation:  originated in Cantor's work with derived sets. If P is a set of real numbers, the derived set P'  is the set of limit points of P. In 1872, Cantor generated the sets P(n) by applying the derived set operation n times to P. In 1880, he pointed out that these sets form the sequence P' ⊇ ··· ⊇ P(n) ⊇ P(n + 1) ⊇ ···, and he continued the derivation process by defining P(∞) as the intersection of these sets. Then he iterated the derived set operation and intersections to extend his sequence of sets into the infinite: P(∞) ⊇ P(∞ + 1) ⊇ P(∞ + 2) ⊇ ··· ⊇ P(2∞) ⊇ ··· ⊇ P(∞2) ⊇ ···.;  The superscripts containing ∞ are just indices defined by the derivation process.\n\nCantor used these sets in the theorems: (1) If P(α) = ∅ for some index α, then P'  is countable; (2) Conversely, if P'  is countable, then there is an index α such that P(α) = ∅. These theorems are proved by partitioning P'  into pairwise disjoint sets: P = (P' ∖ P(2)) ∪ (P(2) ∖ P(3)) ∪ ··· ∪ (P(∞) ∖ P(∞ + 1)) ∪ ··· ∪ P(α). For β < α: since P(β + 1) contains the limit points of P(β), the sets P(β) ∖ P(β + 1) have no limit points. Hence, they are discrete sets, so they are countable. Proof of first theorem: If P(α) = ∅ for some index α, then P'  is the countable union of countable sets. Therefore, P'  is countable.; \n\nThe second theorem requires proving the existence of an α such that P(α) = ∅. To prove this, Cantor considered the set of all α having countably many predecessors. To define this set, he defined the transfinite ordinal numbers and transformed the infinite indices into ordinals by replacing ∞ with ω, the first transfinite ordinal number. Cantor called the set of finite ordinals the first number class. The second number class is the set of ordinals whose predecessors form a countably infinite set. The set of all α having countably many predecessors—that is, the set of countable ordinals—is the union of these two number classes. Cantor proved that the cardinality of the second number class is the first uncountable cardinality.; \n\nCantor's second theorem becomes: If P'  is countable, then there is a countable ordinal α such that P(α) = ∅. Its proof uses proof by contradiction. Let P'  be countable, and assume there is no such α. This assumption produces two cases.\n\n Case 1: P(β) ∖ P(β + 1) is non-empty for all countable β. Since there are uncountably many of these pairwise disjoint sets, their union is uncountable. This union is a subset of P''', so P'  is uncountable.\n Case 2: P(β) ∖ P(β + 1) is empty for some countable β. Since P(β + 1) ⊆ P(β), this implies P(β + 1) = P(β). Thus, P(β) is a perfect set, so it is uncountable. Since P(β) ⊆ P, the set P'  is uncountable.\n\nIn both cases, P'  is uncountable, which contradicts P'  being countable. Therefore, there is a countable ordinal α such that P(α) = ∅. Cantor's work with derived sets and ordinal numbers led to the Cantor-Bendixson theorem.\n\nUsing successors, limits, and cardinality, Cantor generated an unbounded sequence of ordinal numbers and number classes. The (α + 1)-th number class is the set of ordinals whose predecessors form a set of the same cardinality as the α-th number class. The cardinality of the (α + 1)-th number class is the cardinality immediately following that of the α-th number class. For a limit ordinal α, the α-th number class is the union of the β-th number classes for β < α. Its cardinality is the limit of the cardinalities of these number classes.\n\nIf n is finite, the n-th number class has cardinality . If α ≥ ω, the α-th number class has cardinality .The first number class has cardinality . Mathematical induction proves that the n-th number class has cardinality . Since the ω-th number class is the union of the n-th number classes, its cardinality is , the limit of the . Transfinite induction proves that if α ≥ ω, the α-th number class has cardinality . Therefore, the cardinalities of the number classes correspond one-to-one with the aleph numbers. Also, the α-th number class consists of ordinals different from those in the preceding number classes if and only if α is a non-limit ordinal. Therefore, the non-limit number classes partition the ordinals into pairwise disjoint sets.\n\nSee also\nCounting\nOrdinal space\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n .

      "text": "In number theory, the prime number theorem (PNT) describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs.  The theorem was proved independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin in 1896 using ideas introduced by Bernhard Riemann (in particular, the Riemann zeta function).\n\nThe first such distribution found is , where  is the prime-counting function and  is the natural logarithm of . This means that for large enough , the probability that a random integer not greater than  is prime is very close to . Consequently, a random integer with at most  digits (for large enough ) is about half as likely to be prime as a random integer with at most  digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime (), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime (). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first  integers is roughly .\n\nStatement\nthumb|300px|Graph showing ratio of the prime-counting function  to two of its approximations,  and . As  increases (note  axis is logarithmic), both ratios tend towards 1. The ratio for  converges from above very slowly, while the ratio for  converges more quickly from below.\nthumb|300px|Log-log plot showing absolute error of  and , two approximations to the prime-counting function . Unlike the ratio, the difference between  and  increases without bound as  increases. On the other hand,  switches sign infinitely many times.\n\nLet  be the prime-counting function that gives the number of primes less than or equal to , for any real number . For example,  because there are four prime numbers (2, 3, 5 and 7) less than or equal to 10. The prime number theorem then states that  is a good approximation to , in the sense that the limit of the quotient of the two functions  and  as  increases without bound is 1:\n\n \n\nknown as the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. Using asymptotic notation this result can be restated as\n\nThis notation (and the theorem) does not say anything about the limit of the difference of the two functions as  increases without bound. Instead, the theorem states that  approximates  in the sense that the relative error of this approximation approaches 0 as  increases without bound.\n\nThe prime number theorem is equivalent to the statement that the th prime number  satisfies\n\nthe asymptotic notation meaning, again, that the relative error of this approximation approaches 0 as  increases without bound. For example, the th prime number is , and ()log() rounds to , a relative error of about 6.4%.\n\nThe prime number theorem is also equivalent to\n\nwhere  and  are the first and the second Chebyshev functions respectively.\n\nHistory of the proof of the asymptotic law of prime numbers\n231px|right|thumb|Distribution of primes up to 19# ().\n\nBased on the tables by Anton Felkel and Jurij Vega, Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectured in 1797 or 1798 that  is approximated by the function , where  and  are unspecified constants. In the second edition of his book on number theory (1808) he then made a more precise conjecture, with  and . Carl Friedrich Gauss considered the same question at age 15 or 16 \"in the year 1792 or 1793\", according to his own recollection in 1849.C. F. Gauss. Werke, Bd 2, 1st ed, 444–447. Göttingen 1863. In 1838 Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet came up with his own approximating function, the logarithmic integral  (under the slightly different form of a series, which he communicated to Gauss). Both Legendre's and Dirichlet's formulas imply the same conjectured asymptotic equivalence of  and  stated above, although it turned out that Dirichlet's approximation is considerably better if one considers the differences instead of quotients.\n\nIn two papers from 1848 and 1850, the Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev attempted to prove the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. His work is notable for the use of the zeta function , for real values of the argument \"\", as in works of Leonhard Euler, as early as 1737. Chebyshev's papers predated Riemann's celebrated memoir of 1859, and he succeeded in proving a slightly weaker form of the asymptotic law, namely, that if the limit of  as  goes to infinity exists at all, then it is necessarily equal to one. He was able to prove unconditionally that this ratio is bounded above and below by two explicitly given constants near 1, for all sufficiently large . Although Chebyshev's paper did not prove the Prime Number Theorem, his estimates for  were strong enough for him to prove Bertrand's postulate that there exists a prime number between  and  for any integer .\n\nAn important paper concerning the distribution of prime numbers was Riemann's 1859 memoir \"On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude\", the only paper he ever wrote on the subject. Riemann introduced new ideas into the subject, the chief of them being that the distribution of prime numbers is intimately connected with the zeros of the analytically extended Riemann zeta function of a complex variable. In particular, it is in this paper of Riemann that the idea to apply methods of complex analysis to the study of the real function  originates. Extending the ideas of Riemann, two proofs of the asymptotic law of the distribution of prime numbers were obtained independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin and appeared in the same year (1896). Both proofs used methods from complex analysis, establishing as a main step of the proof that the Riemann zeta function  is non-zero for all complex values of the variable  that have the form  with .\n\nDuring the 20th century, the theorem of Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin also became known as the Prime Number Theorem. Several different proofs of it were found, including the \"elementary\" proofs of Atle Selberg and Paul Erdős (1949). While the original proofs of Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin are long and elaborate, later proofs introduced various simplifications through the use of Tauberian theorems but remained difficult to digest. A short proof was discovered in 1980 by American mathematician Donald J. Newman. Newman's proof is arguably the simplest known proof of the theorem, although it is non-elementary in the sense that it uses Cauchy's integral theorem from complex analysis.\n\nProof sketch\nHere is a sketch of the proof referred to in one of Terence Tao's lectures. Like most proofs of the PNT, it starts out by reformulating the problem in terms of a less intuitive, but better-behaved, prime-counting function. The idea is to count the primes (or a related set such as the set of prime powers) with weights to arrive at a function with smoother asymptotic behavior. The most common such generalized counting function is the Chebyshev function , defined by\n\nThis is sometimes written as\n\nwhere  is the von Mangoldt function, namely\n\nIt is now relatively easy to check that the PNT is equivalent to the claim that\n\nIndeed, this follows from the easy estimates\n\nand (using big  notation) for any ,\n\nThe next step is to find a useful representation for . Let  be the Riemann zeta function. It can be shown that  is related to the von Mangoldt function , and hence to , via the relation\n\nA delicate analysis of this equation and related properties of the zeta function, using the Mellin transform and Perron's formula, shows that for non-integer  the equation\n\nholds, where the sum is over all zeros (trivial and nontrivial) of the zeta function. This striking formula is one of the so-called explicit formulas of number theory, and is already suggestive of the result we wish to prove, since the term  (claimed to be the correct asymptotic order of ) appears on the right-hand side, followed by (presumably) lower-order asymptotic terms.\n\nThe next step in the proof involves a study of the zeros of the zeta function. The trivial zeros −2, −4, −6, −8, ... can be handled separately:\n\nwhich vanishes for a large . The nontrivial zeros, namely those on the critical strip , can potentially be of an asymptotic order comparable to the main term  if , so we need to show that all zeros have real part strictly less than 1.\n\nTo do this, we take for granted that  is meromorphic in the half-plane , and is analytic there except for a simple pole at , and that there is a product formula\n\nfor . This product formula follows from the existence of unique prime factorization of integers, and shows that  is never zero in this region, so that its logarithm is defined there and\n\nWrite ; then\n\nNow observe the identity\n\nso that\n\nfor all . Suppose now that . Certainly  is not zero, since  has a simple pole at . Suppose that  and let  tend to 1 from above. Since  has a simple pole at  and  stays analytic, the left hand side in the previous inequality tends to 0, a contradiction.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that the PNT is heuristically true. To rigorously complete the proof there are still serious technicalities to overcome, due to the fact that the summation over zeta zeros in the explicit formula for  does not converge absolutely but only conditionally and in a \"principal value\" sense. There are several ways around this problem but many of them require rather delicate complex-analytic estimates that are beyond the scope of this paper. Edwards's book provides the details. Another method is to use Ikehara's Tauberian theorem, though this theorem is itself quite hard to prove. D. J. Newman observed that the full strength of Ikehara's theorem is not needed for the prime number theorem, and one can get away with a special case that is much easier to prove.\n\nPrime-counting function in terms of the logarithmic integral\nIn a handwritten note on a reprint of his 1838 paper \"\", which he mailed to Gauss, Dirichlet conjectured (under a slightly different form appealing to a series rather than an integral) that an even better approximation to  is given by the offset logarithmic integral function , defined by\n\nIndeed, this integral is strongly suggestive of the notion that the \"density\" of primes around  should be . This function is related to the logarithm by the asymptotic expansion\n\nSo, the prime number theorem can also be written as . In fact, in another paper in 1899 de la Vallée Poussin proved that\n\nfor some positive constant , where  is the big  notation. This has been improved to\n\n where .\n\nIn 2016, Trudgian proved an explicit upper bound for the difference between  and :\n\nfor .\n\nBecause of the connection between the Riemann zeta function and , the Riemann hypothesis has considerable importance in number theory: if established, it would yield a far better estimate of the error involved in the prime number theorem than is available today. More specifically, Helge von Koch showed in 1901 that, if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true, the error term in the above relation can be improved to\n\nThe constant involved in the big  notation was estimated in 1976 by Lowell Schoenfeld:. assuming the Riemann hypothesis,\n\nfor all . He also derived a similar bound for the Chebyshev prime-counting function :\n\nfor all . This latter bound has been shown to express a variance to mean power law (when regarded as a random function over the integers),  noise and to also correspond to the Tweedie compound Poisson distribution. Parenthetically, the Tweedie distributions represent a family of scale invariant distributions that serve as foci of convergence for a generalization of the central limit theorem.\n\nThe logarithmic integral  is larger than  for \"small\" values of . This is because it is (in some sense) counting not primes, but prime powers, where a power  of a prime  is counted as  of a prime. This suggests that  should usually be larger than  by roughly , and in particular should always be larger than . However, in 1914, J. E. Littlewood proved that  changes sign infinitely often.\n The first value of  where  exceeds  is probably around ; see the article on Skewes' number for more details. (On the other hand, the offset logarithmic integral  is smaller than  already for ; indeed, , while .)\n\nElementary proofs\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, some mathematicians (notably G. H. Hardy) believed that there exists a hierarchy of proof methods in mathematics depending on what sorts of numbers (integers, reals, complex) a proof requires, and that the prime number theorem (PNT) is a \"deep\" theorem by virtue of requiring complex analysis. This belief was somewhat shaken by a proof of the PNT based on Wiener's tauberian theorem, though this could be set aside if Wiener's theorem were deemed to have a \"depth\" equivalent to that of complex variable methods.\n\nIn March 1948, Atle Selberg established, by \"elementary\" means, the asymptotic formula\n\nwhere\n\nfor primes . By July of that year, Selberg and Paul Erdős had each obtained elementary proofs of the PNT, both using Selberg's asymptotic formula as a starting point. These proofs effectively laid to rest the notion that the PNT was \"deep\", and showed that technically \"elementary\" methods were more powerful than had been believed to be the case. On the history of the elementary proofs of the PNT, including the Erdős–Selberg priority dispute, see an article by Dorian Goldfeld.\n\nThere is some debate about the significance of Erdős and Selberg's result. There is no rigorous and widely accepted definition of the notion of elementary proof in number theory, so it is not clear exactly in what sense their proof is \"elementary\". Although it does not use complex analysis, it is in fact much more technical than the standard proof of PNT. One possible definition of an \"elementary\" proof is \"one that can be carried out in first order Peano arithmetic.\" There are number-theoretic statements (for example, the Paris–Harrington theorem) provable using second order but not first order methods, but such theorems are rare to date. Erdős and Selberg's proof can certainly be formalized in Peano arithmetic, and in 1994, Charalambos Cornaros and Costas Dimitracopoulos proved that their proof can be formalized in a very weak fragment of PA, namely ,. However, this does not address the question of whether or not the standard proof of PNT can be formalized in PA.\n\nComputer verifications\nIn 2005, Avigad et al. employed the Isabelle theorem prover to devise a computer-verified variant of the Erdős–Selberg proof of the PNT. This was the first machine-verified proof of the PNT. Avigad chose to formalize the Erdős–Selberg proof rather than an analytic one because while Isabelle's library at the time could implement the notions of limit, derivative, and transcendental function, it had almost no theory of integration to speak of.\n\nIn 2009, John Harrison employed HOL Light to formalize a proof employing complex analysis. By developing the necessary analytic machinery, including the Cauchy integral formula, Harrison was able to formalize \"a direct, modern and elegant proof instead of the more involved 'elementary' Erdős–Selberg argument\".\n\nPrime number theorem for arithmetic progressions\nLet  denote the number of primes in the arithmetic progression  less than .

In other words, the primes are distributed evenly among the residue classes  modulo  with 1. This is stronger than Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions (which only states that there is an infinity of primes in each class) and can be proved using similar methods used by Newman for his proof of the prime number theorem.\n\nThe Siegel–Walfisz theorem gives a good estimate for the distribution of primes in residue classes.\n\nPrime number race\nAlthough we have in particular\n\nempirically the primes congruent to 3 are more numerous and are nearly always ahead in this \"prime number race\"; the first reversal occurs at . However Littlewood showed in 1914 that there are infinitely many sign changes for the function\n\nso the lead in the race switches back and forth infinitely many times. The phenomenon that  is ahead most of the time is called Chebyshev's bias.

Successor operations are also known as zeration in the context of a zeroth hyperoperation: H0(a, b) = 1 + b. In this context, the extension of zeration is addition, which is defined as repeated succession.\n\nOverview\nThe successor function is used in the Peano axioms which define the natural numbers. As such, it is not defined by addition, but rather is used to define all natural numbers beyond 0, as well as addition. For example, 1 is defined to be S(0), and addition on natural numbers is defined recursively by:\n\n{|\n|-\n| m + 0 || = m\n|-\n| m + S(n) || = S(m) + n\n|}\n\nThis can be used to compute addition of any two natural numbers. For example, 5 + 2 = 5 + S(1) = S(5) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 6 + S(0) = S(6) + 0 = 7 + 0 = 7\n\nSeveral ways have been proposed to construct the natural numbers using set theory, see set-theoretic definition of natural numbers. A common approach is to define the number 0 to be the empty set {}, and the successor S(x) to be x ∪ { x }. The axiom of infinity then guarantees the existence of a set ℕ that contains 0 and is closed with respect to S; members of ℕ are called natural numbers.Halmos, Chapter 11\n\nThe successor function is the level-0 foundation of the infinite Grzegorczyk hierarchy of hyperoperations, used to build addition, multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, etc..

      "text": "In mathematics, the symmetry of second derivatives (also called the equality of mixed partials) refers to the possibility under certain conditions (see below) of interchanging the order of taking partial derivatives of a function\n\nof n variables. If the partial derivative with respect to  is denoted with a subscript , then the symmetry is the assertion that the second-order partial derivatives  satisfy the identity\n\nso that they form an n × n symmetric matrix. This is sometimes known as Schwarz's theorem, Clairaut's theorem, or Young's theorem.\n\nIn the context of partial differential equations it is called the\nSchwarz integrability condition. \n\n Hessian matrix \n\nThis matrix of second-order partial derivatives of f is called the Hessian matrix of f. The entries in it off the main diagonal are the mixed derivatives; that is, successive partial derivatives with respect to different variables.\n\nIn most \"real-life\" circumstances the Hessian matrix is symmetric, although there are a great number of functions that do not have this property. Mathematical analysis reveals that symmetry requires a hypothesis on f that goes further than simply stating the existence of the second derivatives at a particular point. Schwarz' theorem gives a sufficient condition on f for this to occur.\n\n Formal expressions of symmetry \nIn symbols, the symmetry says that, for example,\n\nThis equality can also be written as\n\nAlternatively, the symmetry can be written as an algebraic statement involving the differential operator Di which  takes the partial derivative with respect to xi:\n\nDi . Dj = Dj . Di.\n\nFrom this relation it follows that the ring of differential operators with constant coefficients, generated by the Di, is commutative. But one should naturally specify some domain for these operators. It is easy to check the symmetry as applied to monomials, so that one can take polynomials in the xi as a domain. In fact smooth functions are possible.\n\n Schwarz's theorem \nIn mathematical analysis, Schwarz's theorem (or Clairaut's theorem on equality of mixed partials) named after Alexis Clairaut and Hermann Schwarz, states that if , , some neighborhood of  is contained in ,\n\nand  has continuous second partial derivatives at the point in , then \n\nThe partial derivatives of this function are commutative at that point. One easy way to establish this theorem (in the case where , , and , which readily entails the result in general) is by applying Green's theorem to the gradient of  An elementary proof is as follows. Let\n\nThese functions are defined for , where  is chosen so that holds  and .\n\nBy mean value theorem, for  holds\n\n,\n\n,\n\nfor some functions  such that . The special case is that for  holds\n\nLetting that  tends to zero in the last equality, we conclude that\n\n Sufficiency of twice-differentiability \nA weaker condition than the continuity of second partial derivatives (which is implied by the latter) which suffices to ensure symmetry is that all partial derivatives are themselves differentiable. Another strengthening of the theorem, in which existence of the permuted mixed partial is asserted, was provided by Peano:\n\nIf  is defined on an open set  and  exist everywhere on  , and  is continuous at , then  exists at  and .\n\n History \nThe result of the equality of the mixed partial derivatives under certain conditions has a long history.  Nicolaus I Bernoulli implicitly assumed the result as early as 1721, but Euler was the first to provide a proof.  Other proofs followed by Clairaut (1740), Lagrange (1797), Cauchy (1823) and many others in the 19th century.  None of these proofs were without fault however (for example, Clairaut assumed all definite integrals could be differentiated under the integral sign).  In 1867 Ernst Leonard Lindelöf published a paper criticizing in detail all the proofs he was familiar with.  Finally, six years later Hermann Schwarz (1873) gave the first satisfactory proof. This was followed by successive refinements that relaxed the hypotheses in Schwarz's theorem in various ways, among others by Dini, Jordan, Peano, E. W. Hobson, W. H. Young. For a good historical account, see .\n\n Distribution theory formulation \n\nThe theory of distributions (generalized functions) eliminates analytic problems with the symmetry. The derivative of an integrable function can always be defined as a distribution, and symmetry of mixed partial derivatives always holds as an equality of distributions. The use of formal integration by parts to define differentiation of distributions puts the symmetry question back onto the test functions, which are smooth and certainly satisfy this symmetry. In more detail (where f is a distribution, written as an operator on test functions, and φ is a test function),\n \n\nAnother approach, which defines the Fourier transform of a function, is to note that on such transforms partial derivatives become multiplication operators that commute much more obviously.\n\n Requirement of continuity \nThe symmetry may be broken if the function fails to have differentiable partial derivatives, which is possible if Clairaut's theorem is not satisfied (the second partial derivatives are not continuous).\n\nthumb|right|The function f(x,y), as shown in equation (), does not have symmetric second derivatives at its origin.\nAn example of non-symmetry is the function\n\nThis function is everywhere continuous, but its derivatives at (0,0) cannot be computed algebraically. Rather, the limit of difference quotients shows that , so the graph z = f(x,y) has a horizontal tangent plane at (0,0), and the partial derivatives  exist and are everywhere continuous. However, the second partial derivatives are not continuous at (0,0), and the symmetry fails. In fact, along the x-axis the y-derivative is , and so:\n\nIn contrast, along the y-axis the x-derivative ,\nand so .\nThat is,  at (0, 0), although the mixed partial derivatives do exist, and at every other point the symmetry does hold.\n\nThe above function, written in a cylindrical coordinate system, can be expressed as\n\nshowing that the function oscillates four times when traveling once around an arbitrarily small loop containing the origin. Intuitively, therefore, the local behavior of the function at  cannot be described as a quadratic form, and the Hessian matrix thus fails to be symmetric.\n\nIn general, the interchange of limiting operations need not commute. Given two variables near (0, 0) and two limiting processes on\n\ncorresponding to making h → 0 first, and to making k → 0 first. It can matter, looking at the first-order terms, which is applied first. This leads to the construction of pathological examples in which second derivatives are non-symmetric. This kind of example belongs to the theory of real analysis where the pointwise value of functions matters.  When viewed as a distribution the second partial derivative's values can be changed at an arbitrary set of points as long as this has Lebesgue measure 0. Since in the example the Hessian is symmetric everywhere except (0,0), there is no contradiction with the fact that the Hessian, viewed as a Schwartz distribution, is symmetric.\n\n In Lie theory \nConsider the first-order differential operators Di to be infinitesimal operators on Euclidean space. That is, Di in a sense generates the one-parameter group of translations parallel to the xi-axis. These groups commute with each other, and therefore the infinitesimal generators do also; the Lie bracket\n\n[Di, Dj] = 0\n\nis this property's  reflection. In other words, the Lie derivative of one coordinate with respect to another is zero.\n\n Application to differential forms \nThe Clairaut-Schwarz theorem is the key fact needed to prove that for every  (or at least twice differentiable) differential form , the second exterior derivative vanishes: .  This implies that every differentiable exact form (i.e., a form  such that  for some form ) is closed (i.e., ), since .\n\n References \n\n Further reading \n \n\nCategory:Multivariable calculus\nCategory:Generalized functions\nCategory:Symmetry\nCategory:Theorems in analysis"

Instead of just matching one derivative of f at a, we can match two derivatives, thus producing a polynomial that has the same slope and concavity as f at a.  The quadratic polynomial in question is\n\nTaylor's theorem ensures that the quadratic approximation is, in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the point a, a better approximation than the linear approximation.  Specifically,\n\nHere the error in the approximation is\n\nwhich, given the limiting behavior of , goes to zero faster than  as x tends to a.\n\nthumb|360px|right|Approximation of f(x) = 1/(1 + x2) (blue) by its Taylor polynomials Pk of order k = 1, ..., 16 centered at x = 0 (red) and x = 1 (green). The approximations do not improve at all outside (−1, 1) and (1 − √2, 1 + √2) respectively. Similarly, we might get still better approximations to f if we use polynomials of higher degree, since then we can match even more derivatives with f at the selected base point.\n\nIn general, the error in approximating a function by a polynomial of degree k will go to zero a little bit faster than  as x tends to a. But this might not always be the case: it is also possible that increasing the degree of the approximating polynomial does not increase the quality of approximation at all even if the function f to be approximated is infinitely many times differentiable. An example of this behavior is given below, and it is related to the fact that unlike analytic functions, more general functions are not (locally) determined by the values of their derivatives at a single point.\n\nTaylor's theorem is of asymptotic nature: it only tells us that the error Rk in an approximation by a k-th order Taylor polynomial Pk tends to zero faster than any nonzero k-th degree polynomial as x → a. It does not tell us how large the error is in any concrete neighborhood of the center of expansion, but for this purpose there are explicit formulae for the remainder term (given below) which are valid under some additional regularity assumptions on f. These enhanced versions of Taylor's theorem typically lead to uniform estimates for the approximation error in a small neighborhood of the center of expansion, but the estimates do not necessarily hold for neighborhoods which are too large, even if the function f is analytic. In that situation one may have to select several Taylor polynomials with different centers of expansion to have reliable Taylor-approximations of the original function (see animation on the right.)\n\nThere are several things we might do with the remainder term:\n Estimate the error in using a polynomial Pk(x) of degree k to estimate f(x) on a given interval (a – r, a + r). (The interval and the degree k are fixed; we want to find the error.)\n Find the smallest degree k for which the polynomial Pk(x) approximates f(x) to within a given error (or tolerance) on a given interval (a − r, a + r) . (The interval and the error are fixed; we want to find the degree.)\n Find the largest interval (a − r, a + r) on which Pk(x) approximates f(x) to within a given error (\"tolerance\"). (The degree and the error are fixed; we want to find the interval.)\n\n Taylor's theorem in one real variable \n\n Statement of the theorem \n\nThe precise statement of the most basic version of Taylor's theorem is as follows:\n\nThe polynomial appearing in Taylor's theorem is the k-th order Taylor polynomialof the function f at the point a. The Taylor polynomial is the unique \"asymptotic best fit\" polynomial in the sense that if there exists a function   and a k-th order polynomial p such that\n\nthen p = Pk. Taylor's theorem describes the asymptotic behavior of the remainder termwhich is the approximation error when approximating f with its Taylor polynomial. Using the little-o notation, the statement in Taylor's theorem reads as\n\n Explicit formulas for the remainder \n\nUnder stronger regularity assumptions on f there are several precise formulae for the remainder term Rk of the Taylor polynomial, the most common ones being the following.\n\nThese refinements of Taylor's theorem are usually proved using the mean value theorem, whence the name. Also other similar expressions can be found. For example, if G(t) is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between a and x, then\n\nfor some number ξ between a and x. This version covers the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of the remainder as special cases, and is proved below using Cauchy's mean value theorem.\n\nThe statement for the integral form of the remainder is more advanced than the previous ones, and requires understanding of Lebesgue integration theory for the full generality. However, it holds also in the sense of Riemann integral provided the (k + 1)th derivative of f is continuous on the closed interval [a,x].\n\nDue to absolute continuity of f(k) on the closed interval between a and x, its derivative f(k+1) exists as an L1-function, and the result can be proven by a formal calculation using fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts.\n\n Estimates for the remainder \n\nIt is often useful in practice to be able to estimate the remainder term appearing in the Taylor approximation, rather than having an exact formula for it.  Suppose that f is -times continuously differentiable in an interval I containing a. Suppose that there are real constants q and Q such that\n\nthroughout I. Then the remainder term satisfies the inequality\n\nif , and a similar estimate if . This is a simple consequence of the Lagrange form of the remainder. In particular, if\n\non an interval  with some  , then\n\nfor all  The second inequality is called a uniform estimate, because it holds uniformly for all x on the interval \n\n Example \n\nthumb|400px|right|Approximation of ex (blue) by its Taylor polynomials Pk of order k = 1,...,7 centered at x = 0 (red). Suppose that we wish to approximate the function  on the interval  while ensuring that the error in the approximation is no more than 10−5. In this example we pretend that we only know the following properties of the exponential function:\n\nFrom these properties it follows that  for all k, and in particular, . Hence the k-th order Taylor polynomial of f at 0 and its remainder term in the Lagrange form are given by\n\nwhere ξ is some number between 0 and x. Since ex is increasing by (*), we can simply use ex ≤ 1 for x ∈ [−1, 0] to estimate the remainder on the subinterval [−1, 0]. To obtain an upper bound for the remainder on [0,1], we use the property  for 0<ξ<x to estimate\n\nusing the second order Taylor expansion. Then we solve for ex to deduce that\n\nsimply by maximizing the numerator and minimizing the denominator. Combining these estimates for ex we see that\n\nso the required precision is certainly reached, when\n\n(See factorial or compute by hand the values 9!=362 880 and 10!=3 628 800.) As a conclusion, Taylor's theorem leads to the approximation\n\nFor instance, this approximation provides a decimal expression e ≈ 2.71828, correct up to five decimal places.\n\n Relationship to analyticity \n\n Taylor expansions of real analytic functions \n\nLet I ⊂ R be an open interval. By definition, a function f : I → R is real analytic if it is locally defined by a convergent power series. This means that for every a ∈ I there exists some r > 0 and a sequence of coefficients ck ∈ R such that  and\n\nIn general, the radius of convergence of a power series can be computed from the Cauchy–Hadamard formula\n\nThis result is based on comparison with a geometric series, and the same method shows that if the power series based on a converges for some b ∈ R, it must converge uniformly on the closed interval , where rb = |b − a|. Here only the convergence of the power series is considered, and it might well be that  extends beyond the domain I of f.\n\nThe Taylor polynomials of the real analytic function f at a are simply the finite truncations\n\nof its locally defining power series, and the corresponding remainder terms are locally given by the analytic functions\n\nHere the functions\n\nare also analytic, since their defining power series have the same radius of convergence as the original series. Assuming that  ⊂ I and r < R, all these series converge uniformly on . Naturally, in the case of analytic functions one can estimate the remainder term Rk(x) by the tail of the sequence of the derivatives f′(a) at the center of the expansion, but using complex analysis also another possibility arises, which is described below.\n\n Taylor's theorem and convergence of Taylor series \n\nThe Taylor series of f will converge in some interval, given that all its derivatives are bounded over it and do not grow too fast as k goes to infinity. (However, it is not always the case that the Taylor series of f, if it converges, will in fact converge to f, as explained below; f is then said to be non-analytic.) \n\nOne might think of the Taylor series\n\nof an infinitely many times differentiable function f : R → R as its \"infinite order Taylor polynomial\" at a. Now the estimates for the remainder imply that if, for any r, the derivatives of f are known to be bounded over (a − r,a + r), then for any order k and for any r > 0 there exists a constant  such that\n\nfor every x ∈ (a − r,a + r). Sometimes the constants  can be chosen in such way that  is bounded above, for fixed r and all k. Then the Taylor series of f converges uniformly to some analytic function\n\n(One also gets convergence even if  is not bounded above as long as it grows slowly enough.)\n\nHowever, even though  is always analytic, the case may be that f is not. That is to say, it may well be that an infinitely many times differentiable function f has a Taylor series at a which converges on some open neighborhood of a, but the limit function Tf is different from f. An important example of this phenomenon is provided by the non-analytic smooth function known as a flat function:\n\nUsing the chain rule one can show by mathematical induction that for any order k,\n\nfor some polynomial pk of degree 2(k − 1). The function  tends to zero faster than any polynomial as , so f is infinitely many times differentiable and  for every positive integer k. Now the estimates for the remainder for the Taylor polynomials show that the Taylor series of f converges uniformly to the zero function on the whole real axis. Nothing is wrong in here:\n\n The Taylor series of f converges uniformly to the zero function Tf(x) = 0.\n The zero function is analytic and every coefficient in its Taylor series is zero.\n The function f is infinitely many times differentiable, but not analytic.\n For any k ∈ N and r > 0 there exists Mk,r > 0 such that the remainder term for the k-th order Taylor polynomial of f satisfies (*), and is bounded above, for all k and fixed r.\n\n Taylor's theorem in complex analysis \n\nTaylor's theorem generalizes to functions f : C → C which are complex differentiable in an open subset U ⊂ C of the complex plane. However, its usefulness is dwarfed by other general theorems in complex analysis. Namely, stronger versions of related results can be deduced for complex differentiable functions f : U → C using Cauchy's integral formula as follows.\n\nLet r > 0 such that the closed disk B(z, r) ∪ S(z, r) is contained in U. Then Cauchy's integral formula with a positive parametrization  of the circle S(z, r) with  gives\n\nHere all the integrands are continuous on the circle S(z, r), which justifies differentiation under the integral sign. In particular, if f is once complex differentiable  on the open set U, then it is actually infinitely many times complex differentiable on U. One also obtains the Cauchy's estimates\n\nfor any z ∈ U and r > 0 such that B(z, r) ∪ S(c, r) ⊂ U. These estimates imply that the complex Taylor series\n\nof f converges uniformly on any open disk B(c, r) ⊂ U with S(c, r) ⊂ U into some function Tf. Furthermore, using the contour integral formulae for the derivatives f(k)(c),\n\nso any complex differentiable function f in an open set U ⊂ C is in fact complex analytic. All that is said for real analytic functions here holds also for complex analytic functions with the open interval I replaced by an open subset U ∈ C and a-centered intervals (a − r, a + r) replaced by c-centered disks B(c, r). In particular, the Taylor expansion holds in the form\n\nwhere the remainder term Rk is complex analytic. Methods of complex analysis provide some powerful results regarding Taylor expansions. For example, using Cauchy's integral formula for any positively oriented Jordan curve γ which parametrizes the boundary ∂W ⊂ U of a region W ⊂ U, one obtains expressions for the derivatives  as above, and modifying slightly the computation for , one arrives at the exact formula\n\nThe important feature here is that the quality of the approximation by a Taylor polynomial on the region W ⊂ U is dominated by the values of the function f itself on the boundary ∂W ⊂ U. Similarly, applying Cauchy's estimates to the series expression for the remainder, one obtains the uniform estimates\n\n Example \n\nthumb|right|Complex plot of f(z) = 1/(1 + z2). Modulus is shown by elevation and argument by coloring: cyan=0, blue = /3, violet = 2/3, red = , yellow=4/3, green=5/3.\nThe function\n\nis real analytic, that is, locally determined by its Taylor series. This function was plotted above to illustrate the fact that some elementary functions cannot be approximated by Taylor polynomials in neighborhoods of the center of expansion which are too large. This kind of behavior is easily understood in the framework of complex analysis. Namely, the function f extends into a meromorphic function\n\non the compactified complex plane. It has simple poles at z = i and z = −i, and it is analytic elsewhere. Now its Taylor series centered at z0 converges on any disc B(z0, r) with r < |z − z0|, where the same Taylor series converges at z ∈ C. Therefore, Taylor series of f centered at 0 converges on B(0, 1) and it does not converge for any z ∈ C with |z| > 1 due to the poles at i and −i. For the same reason the Taylor series of f centered at 1 converges on B(1, √2) and does not converge for any z ∈ C with |z − 1| > √2.\n\n Generalizations of Taylor's theorem \n\n Higher-order differentiability \n\nA function f: Rn → R is differentiable at a ∈ Rn if and only if there exists a linear functional L : Rn → R and a function h : Rn → R such that\n\nIf this is the case, then L = df(a) is the (uniquely defined) differential of f at the point a. Furthermore, then the partial derivatives of f exist at a and the differential of f at a is given by\n\nIntroduce the multi-index notation\n\nfor α ∈ Nn and x ∈ Rn.  If all the k-th order partial derivatives of  are continuous at , then by Clairaut's theorem, one can change the order of mixed derivatives at a, so the notation\n\nfor the higher order partial derivatives is justified in this situation. The same is true if all the (k − 1)-th order partial derivatives of f exist in some neighborhood of a and are differentiable at a.This follows from iterated application of the theorem that if the partial derivatives of a function f exist in a neighborhood of a and are continuous at a, then the function is differentiable at a.  See, for instance, . Then we say that f is k times differentiable at the point a .\n\n Taylor's theorem for multivariate functions \n\nIf the function  is k + 1 times continuously differentiable in the closed ball B, then one can derive an exact formula for the remainder in terms of  order partial derivatives of f in this neighborhood. Namely,\n\nIn this case, due to the continuity of (k+1)-th order partial derivatives in the compact set B, one immediately obtains the uniform estimates\n\n Example in two dimensions \n\nFor example, the third-order Taylor polynomial of a smooth function f: R2 → R is, denoting x − a = v,\n\n Proofs \n\n Proof for Taylor's theorem in one real variable \n\nLet\n\nwhere, as in the statement of Taylor's theorem,\n\nIt is sufficient to show that\n\nThe proof here is based on repeated application of L'Hôpital's rule.  Note that, for each , .  Hence each of the first k−1 derivatives of the numerator in  vanishes at , and the same is true of the denominator.  Also, since the condition that the function f be k times differentiable at a point requires differentiability up to order k−1 in a neighborhood of said point (this is true, because differentiability requires a function to be defined in a whole neighborhood of a point), the numerator and its k − 2 derivatives are differentiable in a neighborhood of a. Clearly, the denominator also satisfies said condition, and additionally, doesn't vanish unless x=a, therefore all conditions necessary for L'Hopital's rule are fulfilled, and its use is justified. So\n\nwhere the second to last equality follows by the definition of the derivative at x = a.\n\n Derivation for the mean value forms of the remainder \n\nLet G be any real-valued function, continuous on the closed interval between a and x and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between a and x, and define\n\nFor . Then, by Cauchy's mean value theorem,\n\nfor some ξ on the open interval between a and x. Note that here the numerator  is exactly the remainder of the Taylor polynomial for f(x). Compute\n\nplug it into (*) and rearrange terms to find that\n\nThis is the form of the remainder term mentioned after the actual statement of Taylor's theorem with remainder in the mean value form.\nThe Lagrange form of the remainder is found by choosing  and the Cauchy form by choosing .\n\nRemark. Using this method one can also recover the integral form of the remainder by choosing\n\nbut the requirements for f needed for the use of mean value theorem are too strong, if one aims to prove the claim in the case that f(k) is only absolutely continuous. However, if one uses Riemann integral instead of Lebesgue integral, the assumptions cannot be weakened.\n\n Derivation for the integral form of the remainder \n\nDue to absolute continuity of f(k) on the closed interval between a and x its derivative f(k+1) exists as an L1-function, and we can use fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts. This same proof applies for the Riemann integral assuming that f(k) is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval between a and x, and this leads to the same result than using the mean value theorem.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus states that\n\nNow we can integrate by parts and use the fundamental theorem of calculus again to see that\n\nwhich is exactly Taylor's theorem with remainder in the integral form in the case k=1.\nThe general statement is proved using induction. Suppose that\n\nIntegrating the remainder term by parts we arrive at\n\nSubstituting this into the formula  shows that if it holds for the value k, it must also hold for the value k + 1.\nTherefore, since it holds for k = 1, it must hold for every positive integer k.\n\n Derivation for the Cauchy form of the remainder \n\nTo the integral form of the remainder, we can apply the mean value theorem for integral.\n\n,where \n\nSo, The Cauchy form of the remainder is hold.\n\n Derivation for the remainder of multivariate Taylor polynomials \n\nWe prove the special case, where f : Rn → R has continuous partial derivatives up to the order k+1 in some closed ball B with center a.  The strategy of the proof is to apply the one-variable case of Taylor's theorem to the restriction of f to the line segment adjoining x and a.  Parametrize the line segment between a and x by u(t) =  We apply the one-variable version of Taylor's theorem to the function :\n\nApplying the chain rule for several variables gives\n\nwhere  is the multinomial coefficient.

      "title": "Type theory",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory",
      "text": "In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is any of a class of formal systems, some of which can serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation for all mathematics. In type theory, every \"term\" has a \"type\" and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type.\n\nType theory is closely related to (and in some cases overlaps with) type systems, which are a programming language feature used to reduce bugs. Type theory was created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal logics and rewrite systems.\n\nTwo well-known type theories that can serve as mathematical foundations are Alonzo Church's typed λ-calculus and Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory.\n\nHistory\n\nBetween 1902 and 1908 Bertrand Russell proposed various \"theories of type\" in response to his discovery that Gottlob Frege's version of naive set theory was afflicted with Russell's paradox. By 1908 Russell arrived at a \"ramified\" theory of types together with an \"axiom of reducibility\" both of which featured prominently in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica published between 1910 and 1913. They attempted to resolve Russell's paradox by first creating a hierarchy of types, then assigning each concrete mathematical (and possibly other) entity to a type. Entities of a given type are built exclusively from entities of those types that are lower in their hierarchy, thus preventing an entity from being assigned to itself. In the 1920s, Leon Chwistek and Frank P. Ramsey proposed an unramified type theory, now known as the \"theory of simple types\" or \"simple type theory\", that collapsed the hierarchy of the types in the earlier ramified theory and as such did not require the axiom of reducibility.\n\nThe common usage of \"type theory\" is when those types are used with a term rewrite system. The most famous early example is Alonzo Church's simply typed lambda calculus. Church's theory of typesAlonzo Church, A formulation of the simple theory of types, The Journal of Symbolic Logic 5(2):56–68 (1940) helped the formal system avoid the Kleene–Rosser paradox that afflicted the original untyped lambda calculus. Church demonstrated that it could serve as a foundation of mathematics and it was referred to as a higher-order logic.\n\nSome other type theories include Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory, which has been the foundation used in some areas of constructive mathematics and for the proof assistant Agda. Thierry Coquand's calculus of constructions and its derivatives are the foundation used by Coq and others. The field is an area of active research, as demonstrated by homotopy type theory.\n\nBasic concepts\nIn a system of type theory, each term has a type.  For example, , , and  are all separate terms with the type  for natural numbers.  Traditionally, the term is followed by a colon and its type, such as  - this means that the number  is of type .\n\nType theories have explicit computation and it is encoded in rules for rewriting terms. These are called conversion rules or, if the rule only works in one direction, a reduction rule. For example,  and  are syntactically different terms, but the former reduces to the latter. This reduction is written .\n\nFunctions in type theory have a special reduction rule: the argument of the function call gets substituted for every occurrence of the parameter in the function definition.  Let's say the function  is defined as  (using Church's lambda notation) or  (using a more modern notation).  Then, the function call  would be reduced by substituting  for every copy of  in the body of the function definition.  Thus, .\n\nThe type of a function is denoted with an arrow  from the parameter type to the function's resulting type. Thus, .   Calling or \"applying\" a function to an argument may be written with or without parentheses, so  or . Not using parentheses is more common, because multiple argument functions can be defined using currying.\n\nDifference from set theory\nThere are many different set theories and many different systems of type theory, so what follows are generalizations.\n Set theory is built on top of logic. It requires a separate system like predicate logic underneath it. In type theory, concepts like \"and\" and \"or\" can be encoded as types in the type theory itself.\n In set theory, an element can belong to multiple sets, either to a subset or to a superset. In type theory, terms (generally) belong to only one type. (Where a subset would be used, type theory tends to use a predicate function that returns true if the term is in the subset and returns false if the value is not.  The union of two types can be done by creating a new type called a sum type, which contains new terms.)\n Set theory usually encodes numbers as sets.  (0 is the empty set, 1 is a set containing the empty set, etc.  See Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers.) Type theory can encode numbers as functions using Church encoding or more naturally as inductive types.  Inductive types create new constants for the successor function and zero, and closely resembles Peano's axioms.\n Set theory allows set builder notation.\n Type theory has a simple connection to constructive mathematics through the BHK interpretation.  It can be connected to logic by the Curry Howard isomorphism.  And some type theories are closely connected to Category theory.\n\nOptional features\nNormalization\nThe term  reduces to . Since  cannot be reduced further, it is called a normal form. A system of type theory is said to be strongly normalizing if all terms have a normal form and any order of reductions reaches it. Weakly normalizing systems have a normal form but some orders of reductions may loop forever and never reach it.\n\nFor a normalizing system, some borrow the word element from set theory and use it to refer to all closed terms that can reduce to the same normal form. A closed term is one without parameters. (A term like  with its parameter  is called an open term.) Thus,  and  may be different terms but they are both from the element .\n\nA similar idea that works for open and closed terms is convertibility. Two terms are convertible if there exists a term that they both reduce to. For example,  and  are convertible. As are  and . However,  and  (where  is a free variable) are not because both are in normal form and they are not the same. Confluent and weakly normalizing systems can test if two terms are convertible by checking if they both reduce to the same normal form.\n\nDependent types\n\nA dependent type is a type that depends on a term or on another type. Thus, the type returned by a function may depend upon the argument to the function.\n\nFor example, a list of s of length 4 may be a different type than a list of s of length 5. In a type theory with dependent types, it is possible to define a function that takes a parameter \"n\" and returns a list containing \"n\" zeros. Calling the function with 4 would produce a term with a different type than if the function was called with 5.\n\nDependent types play a central role in intuitionistic type theory and in the design of functional programming languages like Idris, ATS, Agda and Epigram.\n\nEquality types\n\nMany systems of type theory have a type that represents equality of types and of terms. This type is different from convertibility, and is often denoted propositional equality.\n\nIn intuitionistic type theory, the equality type (also called the identity type) is known as  for identity. There is a type  when  is a type and  and  are both terms of type . A term of type  is interpreted as meaning that  is equal to .\n\nIn practice, it is possible to build a type  but there will not exist a term of that type. In intuitionistic type theory, new terms of equality start with reflexivity. If  is a term of type , then there exists a term of type . More complicated equalities can be created by creating a reflexive term and then doing a reduction on one side. So if  is a term of type , then there is a term of type  and, by reduction, generate a term of type . Thus, in this system, the equality type denotes that two values of the same type are convertible by reductions.\n\nHaving a type for equality is important because it can be manipulated inside the system. There is usually no judgement to say two terms are not equal; instead, as in the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation, we map  to , where  is the bottom type having no values. There exists a term with type  but not one of type .\n\nHomotopy type theory differs from intuitionistic type theory mostly by its handling of the equality type.\n\nInductive types\n\nA system of type theory requires some basic terms and types to operate on. Some systems build them out of functions using Church encoding. Other systems have inductive types: a set of base types and a set of type constructors that generate types with well-behaved properties. For example, certain recursive functions called on inductive types are guaranteed to terminate.\n\nCoinductive type are infinite data types created by giving a function that generates the next element(s). See Coinduction and Corecursion.\n\nInduction-induction  is a feature for declaring an inductive type and a family of types that depends on the inductive type.\n\nInduction recursion allows a wider range of well-behaved types, allowing the type and recursive functions operating on it to be defined at the same time.\n\nUniverse types\nTypes were created to prevent paradoxes, such as Russell's paradox. However, the motives that lead to those paradoxes—being able to say things about all types—still exist. So, many type theories have a \"universe type\", which contains all other types (and not itself).\n\nIn systems where you might want to say something about universe types, there is a hierarchy of universe types, each containing the one below it in the hierarchy. The hierarchy is defined as being infinite, but statements must only refer to a finite number of universe levels.\n\nType universes are particularly tricky in type theory. The initial proposal of intuitionistic type theory suffered from Girard's paradox.\n\nComputational component\nMany systems of type theory, such as the simply-typed lambda calculus, intuitionistic type theory, and the calculus of constructions, are also programming languages. That is, they are said to have a \"computational component\". The computation is the reduction of terms of the language using rewriting rules.\n\nA system of type theory that has a well-behaved computational component also has a simple connection to constructive mathematics through the BHK interpretation.\n\nNon-constructive mathematics in these systems is possible by adding operators on continuations such as call with current continuation. However, these operators tend to break desirable properties such as canonicity and parametricity.\n\nType theories\nMajor\n Simply typed lambda calculus which is a higher-order logic;\n intuitionistic type theory;\n system F;\n LF is often used to define other type theories;\n calculus of constructions and its derivatives.\n\nMinor\n Automath;\n ST type theory;\n some forms of combinatory logic;\n others defined in the lambda cube;\n others under the name typed lambda calculus;\n others under the name pure type system.\n\nActive\n Homotopy type theory is being researched.\n\nPractical impact\nProgramming languages\n\nThere is extensive overlap and interaction between the fields of type theory and type systems. Type systems are a programming language feature designed to identify bugs. Any static program analysis, such as the type checking algorithms in the semantic analysis phase of compiler, has a connection to type theory.\n\nA prime example is Agda, a programming language which uses intuitionistic type theory for its type system. The programming language ML was developed for manipulating type theories (see LCF) and its own type system was heavily influenced by them.\n\nMathematical foundations\n\nThe first computer proof assistant, called Automath, used type theory to encode mathematics on a computer. Martin-Löf specifically developed intuitionistic type theory to encode all mathematics to serve as a new foundation for mathematics. There is current research into mathematical foundations using homotopy type theory.\n\nMathematicians working in category theory already had difficulty working with the widely accepted foundation of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. This led to proposals such as Lawvere's Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets (ETCS). Homotopy type theory continues in this line using type theory. Researchers are exploring connections between dependent types (especially the identity type) and algebraic topology (specifically homotopy).\n\nProof assistants\n\nMuch of the current research into type theory is driven by proof checkers, interactive proof assistants, and automated theorem provers. Most of these systems use a type theory as the mathematical foundation for encoding proofs, which is not surprising, given the close connection between type theory and programming languages:\n LF is used by Twelf, often to define other type theories;\n multiple type theories falling under higher-order logic are used by the HOL family of provers and PVS;\n intuitionistic type theory is used by Agda which is both a programming language and proof assistant;\n computational type theory is used by NuPRL;\n calculus of constructions and its derivatives are used by Coq and Matita.\n\nMultiple type theories are supported by LEGO and Isabelle. Isabelle also supports foundations besides type theories, such as ZFC. Mizar is an example of a proof system that only supports set theory.\n\nLinguistics\nType theory is also widely in use in formal theories of semantics of natural languages, especially Montague grammar and its descendants. In particular, categorial grammars and pregroup grammars make extensive use of type constructors to define the types (noun, verb, etc.) of words.\n\nThe most common construction takes the basic types  and  for individuals and truth-values, respectively, and defines the set of types recursively as follows:\n if  and  are types, then so is ;\n nothing except the basic types, and what can be constructed from them by means of the previous clause are types.\n\nA complex type  is the type of functions from entities of type  to entities of type . Thus one has types like  which are interpreted as elements of the set of functions from entities to truth-values, i.e. indicator functions of sets of entities. An expression of type  is a function from sets of entities to truth-values, i.e. a (indicator function of a) set of sets. This latter type is standardly taken to be the type of natural language quantifiers, like  everybody or  nobody (Montague 1973, Barwise and Cooper 1981).\n\nSocial sciences\nGregory Bateson introduced a theory of logical types into the social sciences; his notions of double bind and logical levels are based on Russell's theory of types.\n\nRelation to category theory\nAlthough the initial motivation for category theory was far removed from foundationalism, the two fields turned out to have deep connections. As John Lane Bell writes: \"In fact categories can themselves be viewed as type theories of a certain kind; this fact alone indicates that type theory is much more closely related to category theory than it is to set theory.\" In brief, a category can be viewed as a type theory by regarding its objects as types (or sorts), i.e. \"Roughly speaking, a category may be thought of as a type theory shorn of its syntax.\" A number of significant results follow in this way:\n cartesian closed categories correspond to the typed λ-calculus (Lambek, 1970);\n C-monoids (categories with products and exponentials and a single, nonterminal object) correspond to the untyped λ-calculus (observed independently by Lambek and Dana Scott around 1980);\n locally cartesian closed categories correspond to Martin-Löf type theories (Seely, 1984).\n\nThe interplay, known as categorical logic, has been a subject of active research since then; see the monograph of Jacobs (1999) for instance.\n\nSee also\n Data type for concrete types of data in programming\n Domain theory\n Type (model theory)\n Type system for a more practical discussion of type systems for programming languages\n Univalent foundations\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nW.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typed_lambda_calculus",
      "text": "A typed lambda calculus is a typed formalism that uses the lambda-symbol () to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the untyped lambda calculus but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and untyped lambda calculus a special case with only one type.\n\nTyped lambda calculi are foundational programming languages and are the base of typed functional programming languages such as ML and Haskell and, more indirectly, typed imperative programming languages. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of type systems for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.\n\nTyped lambda calculi are closely related to mathematical logic and proof theory via the Curry–Howard isomorphism and they can be considered as the internal language of classes of categories, e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of Cartesian closed categories (CCCs).\n\n Kinds of typed lambda calculi \nVarious typed lambda calculi have been studied. The simply typed lambda calculus has only one type constructor, the arrow , and its only types are basic types and function types . System T extends the simply typed lambda calculus with a type of natural numbers and higher order primitive recursion; in this system all functions provably recursive in Peano arithmetic are definable. System F allows polymorphism by using universal quantification over all types; from a logical perspective it can describe all functions that are provably total in second-order logic. Lambda calculi with dependent types are the base of intuitionistic type theory, the calculus of constructions and the logical framework (LF), a pure lambda calculus with dependent types. Based on work by Berardi on pure type systems, Henk Barendregt proposed the Lambda cube to systematize the relations of pure typed lambda calculi (including simply typed lambda calculus, System F, LF and the calculus of constructions).\n\nSome typed lambda calculi introduce a notion of subtyping, i.e. if  is a subtype of , then all terms of type  also have type . Typed lambda calculi with subtyping are the simply typed lambda calculus with conjunctive types and System F<:.\n\nAll the systems mentioned so far, with the exception of the untyped lambda calculus, are strongly normalizing: all computations terminate. Therefore, they cannot describe all Turing-computable functions.since the halting problem for the latter class was proven to be undecidable As another consequence they are consistent as a logic, i.e. there are uninhabited types. There exist, however, typed lambda calculi that are not strongly normalizing. For example the dependently typed lambda calculus with a type of all types (Type : Type) is not normalizing due to Girard's paradox. This system is also the simplest pure type system, a formalism which generalizes the Lambda cube. Systems with explicit recursion combinators, such as Plotkin's \"Programming language for Computable Functions\" (PCF), are not normalizing, but they are not intended to be interpreted as a logic. Indeed, PCF is a prototypical, typed functional programming language, where types are used to ensure that programs are well-behaved but not necessarily that they are terminating.\n\n Applications to programming languages \nIn computer programming, the routines (functions, procedures, methods) of strongly typed programming languages closely correspond to typed lambda expressions.\n\n See also \n Kappa calculus—an analogue of typed lambda calculus which excludes higher-order functions\n\n Notes \n\n Further reading \n Henk Barendregt, Lambda Calculi with Types, Handbook of Logic in Computer Science, Volume II, Oxford University Press, pp. 117–309.\n\nCategory:Lambda calculus\nCategory:Logic in computer science\nCategory:Theory of computation\nCategory:Type theory"
