Many early texts mention Pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a sexagesimal numeral system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.[16]',\n",

His textbook Elements is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.[18] The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be Archimedes (c. 287–212 BC) of Syracuse.[19] He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of solids of revolution and used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.[20] Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are conic sections (Apollonius of Perga, 3rd century BC),[21] trigonometry (Hipparchus of Nicaea (2nd century BC),[22] and the beginnings of algebra (Diophantus, 3rd century AD).[23]',\n",

The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. Leonhard Euler was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory, number theory, and statistics. In the early 20th century, Kurt Gödel transformed mathematics by publishing his incompleteness theorems, which show that any axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.',\n",

       " 'The word mathematics comes from Ancient Greek μάθημα (máthēma), meaning \"that which is learnt\",[25] \"what one gets to know\", hence also \"study\" and \"science\". The word for \"mathematics\" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning \"mathematical study\" even in Classical times.[26] Its adjective is μαθηματικός (mathēmatikós), meaning \"related to learning\" or \"studious\", which likewise further came to mean \"mathematical\". In particular, μαθηματικὴ τέχνη (mathēmatikḗ tékhnē), Latin: ars mathematica, meant \"the mathematical art\".',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the mathēmatikoi (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant \"teachers\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, Saint Augustine\\'s warning that Christians should beware of mathematici, meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[27]',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form les mathématiques (and the less commonly used singular derivative la mathématique), goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural τὰ μαθηματικά (ta mathēmatiká), used by Aristotle (384–322 BC), and meaning roughly \"all things mathematical\"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, which were inherited from Greek.[28] In English, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to maths or, in North America, math.[29]']"
