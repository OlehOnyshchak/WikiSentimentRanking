The school is accredited by [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].\\n\\nThe school year is divided into 5 \\'blocks\\', each of which consist of 6 normal academic weeks and a build week.\\n\\nEach student has 5 courses: 4 \\'morning\\' courses that vary across grades, and a math class. The morning courses meet twice a week for 80 minutes per class. The math courses meet for two hours and ten minutes every day in the afternoon.  \\n\\nThe (non-post-calculus) math classes focus on a different subject each block: Block 1 is Combinatorics, Block 2 is Algebra, Block 3 is Geometry, Block 4 is Algebra and Pre-Calculus, and Block 5 is Number Theory.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n== Teams and Clubs ==\\nProof School currently has a number of internal clubs, as well as a [[Zero Robotics]] team called [https://proofrobotics.com Proof Robotics]. The team qualified for the competition finals, and is the leading member of the alliance Hit or Miss with the following teams: [http://www.liceocecioni.gov.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=880&Itemid=503 Crab Nebula] from Liveo Cecioni in Livorno, Italy and [http://www.crzerog.org/zero-robotics.html Rock Rovers] from Council Rock High School South in Holland, PA, USA. Hit or Miss placed 2nd place internationally, and performed one of the first satellite hookings aboard the ISS.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Private schools in California]]\\n[[Category:Schools in San Francisco]]\\n[[Category:Mathematics]]'}"
