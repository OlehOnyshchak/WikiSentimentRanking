    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to create a tool that allows user to get a ranking of Wikipedia articles relevant to the user-defined query. Ranking is built by sentiment strength of an article text.\n"

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently a lot of research was done in the field of news and articles sentiment analysis. For social media text, like tweets or facebook posts it is relatively easy to analyse sentiment. At the same tiem, longer and more complex formal texts like news and articles may contain words of a strong positive/negative sentiment, while being neutral. For instance, neutral article describing a crime will have strong negative sentiment, according to social media sentiment analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, several approaches were developed. E.g. Balahur et al.**[1]** tried to determine the best approach to sentiment analysis in news. Enhanced vocabulary-based approach was used. Subtracting subject-field specific vocabulary significantly improved quality of the sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to detect subjectivity in the text along with concepts this sentiment is related to. This was successfully applied tested by Godbole et al. in **[2]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nielsen et al. in **[3]** tried to built a system for real-time monitoring of sentiment in company related articles. While Zhou et al. investigated the question of neutrality comparison of articles in different languages in **[4]**. In particular, articles about recent wars were considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who cares and why? Summary.\n",
    "1. Wikipedia society: Wikipedia articles should be written form a neutral point of view ([NPOV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view)). Conflict of interests should be detected and biased articles should be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Authors: Authors want to create such a high-quality content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Readers: Readers want to read neutral articles to get information, not opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PR department of company or public person: Companies want to track attitude of society to them & their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, developed in a modular fashion, such a system can be scaled to API of other information sources, like Google Search.\n"

    "## Problem formulation (ML task)\n",
    "Given a set of $n$ texts (articles) $\\{t_i | i=\\overline{1;n}\\}$ related to certain query, built a ranking of these texts by sentiment strength $\\{j-th\\text{ rank}:\\hat{t_i} | j=\\overline{1;n}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In context of Machine Learning this is a classsical regression problem: for the text one should predict sentiment score from $s_{-}$ - minimum possible negative score indicating strongest negative sentiment, to $s_{+}$ - maximum possible positive score indicating strongest positive sentiment, $0$ - absolutely neutral text. I.e. $|s|$ represents sentiment strength, while $sign(s)$ corresponds to positive or negative sentiment polarity. "

    "Each approach has its' own advantages and drawbacks. These can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. VADER - Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner\n",
    "As mentioned in the original paper [5] by Hutto et al. this scorer was developed based on social media text analysis. however, it is successfully aplicable to more formal texts like articles and news. Especially, if one aims to detect simple language structures that are expressing positive or negative sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting clear signs of the subjective opinions in Wikipedia articles is in the field of our research interest. Thus, we decided to utilize this approach. Its' advantages and disadvantages can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "+ Developed for social media, but well applicable to other formats - news, articles.\n",
    "+ Considers  negations and other complex language structure in a text.\n",
    "+ Good results for simple subjectivities - can be used as a baseline, or first step method as a rough estimator.\n",
    "+ Easy to use.\n",
    "+ Works faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons:\n",
    "- Rule-based approach misses everything out of rules. In addition, complex language structures, like irony are missed.\n",
    "- Isnâ€™t possible to determine what exactly is negative: sentiment or concept. E.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model-based - Logistic regression \n",
    "\n",
    "In sentiment analysis of complex natural texts there is a common problem. Problem of separating subjective opinions related to concept from negative concepts described neutrally. \n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this obstacle, more complex model was considered. However, as at first we aim detecting clear signs of the subjective opinions in Wikipedia articles, simple model - linear regression was considered.  Model is trained to predict sentiment class (positive or negative polarity of text). Then probability of belonging to positive class after certain adjustment is considered as sentiment score. Its' advantages and disadvantages can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "+ Theoretically, can be used to determine what is negative: sentiment or concept. However, more complex models, like Neural Networks (in particular, LSTMs) should be utilized. \n",
    "+ Allows to achieve better results, because of more complex model structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons:\n",
    "- Harder to use properly.\n",
    "- Hard to find proper dataset.\n",
    "- Slower scoring.\n",
    "- Overfitting to certain particularities of the data."

    "## Data\n",
    "### Vocabulary-based approach - VADER\n",
    "VADER uses a combination of a sentiment lexicon and set of linguistic rules to determine polarity and sentiment strength. \n",
    "sentiment lexicon is a dictionary, where  lexical features (e.g., words) corespond to score that represents positive or negative semantic orientation. In this case, we don't explicetely use any training data, but a sentiment lexicon in the VADER scorer is kind of implicit labeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-based approach Twitter sentiment dataset\n",
    "For model based approach 1.6M tweets [6], each labeled as belonging to either positive or negative class, was utilized. Obviously, social media texts don't contain all the information to train general model for sentiment detection in formal texts. However, such a training data is aplicable in case of direct subjectivity detection, i.e. when one tries to detect sentiment expressed in simple natural language structures.\n"

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment we are interested in ranking of the articles much more, than in exact values of sentiment score. \n",
    "Thus, we decided to conduct qualitative evaluation of our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative evaluation procedure can be formalized in the following steps:\n",
    "1. Determine a search query.\n",
    "2. Get a set of relevant articles.\n",
    "3. Evaluate sentiment scores for these articles and build a ranking.\n",
    "4. Take article from the middle of the ranking (without loss of generality, let it be article with median sentiment score in a a sample)\n",
    "5. Locally add 2 more copies of this articles to the sample. Edit one copy to be clearly (for human expert) negative and one - to be clearly positive. E.g. by adding template paragraf of strong negative/positive sentiment respectively.\n",
    "6. Evaluate sentiment scores for extended set of articles and build a new ranking.\n",
    "7. Expected result - copy edited such that it is clearly obvious should be higher in ranking, than original one. The other edited copy should be lower, as it is clearly has stronger negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two templates of positive/negative paragraphs utilized:\n",
    "> `<Query>` is very bad. And author doesn't provide any justification. \n",
    "    People don't like `<Query>`. \n",
    "    Some even hate `<Query>`, because `<Query>` is evil.\n",
    "    Some groups believe `<Query>` is their main enemy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> `<Query>` is very good. And author doesn't provide any justification. \n",
    "    People like `<Query>`. \n",
    "    Some even love `<Query>`, because `<Query>` is honest.\n",
    "    Some groups believe `<Query>` is their best friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "We added query to the paragraphs to make it clear, that subjectivity is expressed related to the concept of user-defined query. This may be useful later, when more complex models, that are separating negative concepts from negative opinions about these concepts, will be evaluated.\n",
