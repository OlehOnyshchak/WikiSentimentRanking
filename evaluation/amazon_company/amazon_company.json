It is considered one of the Big Four technology companies along with Google, Apple, and Facebook.[7][8][9]\n\nAmazon is known for its disruption of well-established industries through technological innovation and mass scale.[10][11][12] It is the world's largest e-commerce marketplace, AI assistant provider, and cloud computing platform[13] as measured by revenue and market capitalization.[14] Amazon is the largest Internet company by revenue in the world.[15] It is the second largest private employer in the United States[16] and one of the world's most valuable companies.

The company initially started as an online marketplace for books but later expanded to sell electronics, software, video games, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization.[17] In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion, which vastly increased Amazon's presence as a brick-and-mortar retailer.[18] In 2018, Bezos announced that its two-day delivery service, Amazon Prime, had surpassed 100 million subscribers worldwide.[19][20]\n\nAmazon distributes downloads and streaming of video, music, audiobook through its Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, and Audible subsidiaries.

It produces consumer electronics including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV, and Echo devices. In addition, Amazon subsidiaries also include Ring, Twitch.tv, Whole Foods Market, and iMDb. Among various controversies, the company has been criticized for technological surveillance overreach,[21] a hyper-competitive and demanding work culture,[22] tax avoidance,[23] and anti-competitive practices.[24]\nHistory\nIn 1994, Jeff Bezos incorporated Amazon. He chose the location Seattle because of technical talent as Microsoft is located there.[25] In May 1997, the organization went public. The company began selling music and videos in 1998, at which time it began operations internationally by acquiring online sellers of books in United Kingdom and Germany. The following year, the organization also sold video games, consumer electronics, home-improvement items, software, games, and toys in addition to other items.\n\nIn 2002, the corporation started Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provided data on Web site popularity, Internet traffic patterns and other statistics for marketers and developers. In 2006, the organization grew its AWS portfolio when Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which rents computer processing power as well as Simple Storage Service (S3), that rents data storage via the Internet, were made available. That same year, the company started Fulfillment by Amazon which managed the inventory of individuals and small companies selling their belongings through the company internet site.

In 2004, Toys Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys  Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its own independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[28][29][30]\n\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would co-manage Borders.com as a co-branded service,[31] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[32]\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Sandman, and Watchmen.
